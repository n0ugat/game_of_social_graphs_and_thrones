# game_of_social_graphs_and_thrones
Final project about Game of Thrones for the DTU course Social Graphs and Interactions (02805).

## Central Idea:
### Idea
Our main idea is analyzing the many connections in the *Game of Thrones* universe.

### Why is it interesting?
Game of Thrones features a vast universe, rich in characters, cast, episodes, books, lore, etc. The universe was really popularized by the HBO series Game of Thrones, which was adopted by the original book series *A Song of Ice and Fire* by George R. R. Martin. 

### Datasets
To do our project we downloaded the pages that make up the [Wiki of Westeros](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Westeros).

### Download process
To download the needed pages, we used the skills we've learned in the course about APIs.
