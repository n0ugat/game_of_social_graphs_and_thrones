A '''street tough''' is a resident of [[Braavos]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
He and [[Street tough 1|his comrade]] see [[Arya Stark]] cutting the heads off pigeons with her sword [[Needle]] on the streets of [[Braavos]]. They advance on her intending to steal the sword, but flee when they see an [[Jaqen H'ghar|old man]].{{Ref|GOT502}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no parallel to this character. He and his companions are perhaps based loosely on two [[bravo]]s named Terro and Orbelo, who pick on [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] at night. Arya spots them, intervenes and threatens the Bravos with her knife, and they go away.
