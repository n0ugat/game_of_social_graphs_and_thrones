In the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Maekar Targaryen is the Prince of [[Summerhall]], the summer palace of House Targaryen in the [[stormlands]]. He is powerfully built, with straight hair and square-cut beard, both a very pale silver (almost white) with a hint of gold. His cheeks are marred by pox scars.

Maekar is prickly, impatient, and brooding, quick to judge and condemn. He is uncharismatic and does not make friends and allies easily. In this respect he is not unlike his descendant [[Stannis Baratheon]].

Maekar fought against [[Daemon Blackfyre]] in the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]. He and his brother [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor]] are famed for the "hammer and anvil" tactic they used to win the [[Battle of the Redgrass Field]]. Even so, Maekar feels unappreciated for his part in the victory.

Aside from his four sons, he has two daughters named Rhae and Daella.
