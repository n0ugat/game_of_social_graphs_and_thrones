The '''Shadow Tower'''{{Ref|GOT305}} is a castle on the [[Wall]]. It is located close to the western end of the Wall. At the time of the series, the Shadow Tower is one of only three castles on the [[Wall]] still manned by the [[Night's Watch]], along with [[Castle Black]] and [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. There are nineteen castles along the Wall, but as their numbers fell over the centuries the Night's Watch had to abandon sixteen of them.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Shadow Tower is under the command of Ser Denys Mallister, an experienced and conservative commander, and uncle to Lord [[Jason Mallister]] of [[Seagard]]. [[Qhorin]] was usually based at the Shadow Tower.

According to [[Jeor Mormont]], at the start of the books there are about 200 soldiers in the Shadow Tower. Qhorin led 100 of them to the [[great ranging]].

It is not the westernmost castle of the Night's Watch, which used to be Westwatch-by-the-Bridge. Westwatch is north of the Gorge and west of the Wall and is no longer garrisoned at the start of the books.

Patrols and scouts from the Shadow Tower have to keep a close eye on the surrounding terrain. Though extremely difficult, it is possible to by-pass the Wall by descending into the Gorge, or by tracing a dangerous route through the [[Frostfangs]] to the west and crossing the Bridge of Skulls. The Night's Watch has to keep an eye on these routes for signs of [[Free Folk|wildling]] activity.
