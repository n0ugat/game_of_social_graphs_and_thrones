{{Dialogue a-b|Theon Greyjoy|You all know me.|Farlen|Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.|Farlen to [[Theon Greyjoy]], who has just taken Winterfell.|The Old Gods and the New}}
'''Farlen''' is the [[kennelmaster]] at [[Winterfell]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Farlen is the kennelmaster at [[Winterfell]]. He has a daughter, [[Palla]].{{Ref|GOT206}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[File:Bran surrenders Winterfell.jpg|thumb|Winterfell gathers to witness Bran surrendering to Theon]]
After Winterfell is [[Capture of Winterfell|seized by Ironborn raiders]] led by [[Theon Greyjoy]], Farlen is among the members of the [[House Stark|Stark]] household forcibly assembled at the castle's yard to witness Prince [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s official yielding to Theon. Farlen refuses to serve Theon, and insists he's a servant of House Stark. One of the Ironborn raiders, [[Drennan]], beats him over the head with a club. He is helped up off the ground by his daughter.{{Ref|GOT206}} They are both present when Theon assembles the people after the escape of Bran and [[Rickon Stark]] and unveils two charred corpses and hangs them up on either side of the castle gates.{{Ref|GOT207}}

==Quotes==
{{Dialogue a-b-c|Theon Greyjoy|He claims the North as well by right of conquest. You are all his subjects.|Farlen|Bugger that. I serve the Starks. If you think you can hold the North with this lot...|Drennan|Shut up!|Farlen defiantly proclaims his loyalty to the Starks, prompting [[Drennan]] to strike him into submission.|The Old Gods and the New}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Farlen is also the loyal kennelmaster of Winterfell.

It is not him but [[Mikken]] the blacksmith who talks defiantly to [[Theon Greyjoy]], and is killed for that.

Farlen is falsely accused by Theon of killing three of the [[ironborn]] (who were actually killed by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] at Theon's command), and is beheaded by Theon. In the TV series, he is replaced by Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] at the execution scene.
