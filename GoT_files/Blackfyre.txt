'''Blackfyre'''{{Ref|HOTD109}} is a [[Valyrian steel]] bastard sword that originally belonged to [[Aegon I Targaryen]], which he carried during [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Afterwards it became the treasured ancestral blade of [[House Targaryen]], carried by kings and princes. When kings held court, the sword was used as a {{WPS|sceptre|scepter}}.{{Ref|HOTD101}}{{Ref|HOTD104}}

A little over a hundred years before the [[War of the Five Kings]], King [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV the Unworthy]] gave Blackfyre to his [[bastard]] son Daemon Waters, a great warrior, instead of his lawful son [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron]]. Many thought that this was a sign that his father favored him to rule. Afterwards, Daemon founded his own [[cadet branch]] of House Targaryen, [[House Blackfyre]]—taking its name from the sword—and he himself became known as [[Daemon Blackfyre]].

On his deathbed, Aegon IV legitimized all of his bastard children, among them Daemon Blackfyre. Daeron succeeded his father as King Daeron II Targaryen, but eventually, Daemon Blackfyre rose up in a civil war to try to replace him on the throne, known as the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]. The sword was lost at the end of the war.<ref>"[[Valyrian Steel (short)|Valyrian Steel]]"</ref>

==In the books==
After Aegon I died, his son [[Aenys Targaryen]] succeeded him as king, a weakling, while his younger son [[Maegor Targaryen]] was the greatest warrior of his generation. When Aegon I died he was cremated along with the sword, as per Valyrian custom, and Blackfyre was recovered from the ashes - no normal fire can harm Valyrian steel. Soon after Aenys succeeded he voluntarily gifted Blackfyre to Maegor, saying that he was always the better warrior and it would be of little use to himself. Aenys meant this as a magnanimous gesture, but many saw it as a sign of weakness to simply give his brother such a vital symbol of royal power; the deed seemed unwise also in view of the fact that Maegor already had another [[Dark Sister|Valyrian steel sword]] in his possession. Maegor's mother, Queen [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]], began espousing the view that, by giving Blackfyre to Maegor, Aenys had tacitly admitted he lacked the strength to rule. 

When Aenys was compelled to exile Maegor after his second marriage to [[Alys Harroway]] outraged the Faith, Aenys commanded Maegor to leave Blackfyre behind; Maegor scornfully replied that Aenys was welcome to take the sword from him if he dared, an action the meek Aenys didn't have the courage to attempt. After Aenys died during the [[Faith Militant uprising]], Maegor usurped the throne ahead of Aenys's own children. The only one to protest was [[Grand Maester]] [[Gawen]], who argued that by all laws of succession Aenys's son [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon]] was the rightful heir, but Maegor promptly beheaded him with a single swing of Blackfyre, and there was no further complaint. Maegor would personally behead another two Grand Maesters with Blackfyre during his reign (Grand Maester [[Myros]] for protesting Maegor's third marriage to [[Tyanna of the Tower]], and Grand Maester [[Desmond]], who fell victim to Maegor's desire for a scapegoat when his son by Alys Harrroway was born a deformed, stillborn monstrosity). He would also later execute Tyanna with the sword when he discovered she'd been poisoning his other wives during their pregnancies, causing them to miscarry deformed infants; after Tyanna confessed her crimes under threat of torture, Maegor cut her heart out with Blackfyre.

After Maegor finally died the sword passed to Aenys's surviving son, King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], who wielded it in several small skirmishes and trials by combat during his reign. Upon his death, the sword passed to his successor Viserys.

Nearly seventy years after that the sword passed to Daemon Blackfyre. Already the greatest fighter of his generation, when he wielded Blackfyre in battle he was said to resemble the Warrior himself (the warrior-aspect of the [[Seven]]). When Daemon died at the [[Battle of Redgrass Field|Battle of the Redgrass Field]], his followers managed to recover the blade, and his half-brother [[Aegor Rivers|Aegor "Bittersteel" Rivers]] led their surviving forces to flee east to the Free Cities, taking Blackfyre with them. Later Bittersteel formed the sellsword army known as the [[Golden Company]], in order to at least maintain some semblance of a standing military force as Daemon's supporters plotted to return to [[Westeros]] and put his sons on the throne.

Fifteen years after the war's end Daemon's thirdborn son, Daemon II returned to Westeros in an attempt to rally his father's former bannermen, and instigate a second rebellion. Nowhere near the warrior that his father was, however, Daemon II fails to inspire the lords of Westeros into following him; partly because he did not have Blackfyre in his possession, as Bittersteel had refused to give it to him. The sword itself presumably remained with Bittersteel in Tyrosh. What happened to it after his death, however, is unknown.
