[[Dragonglass]] is a hard but brittle stone, rare in the mainland of [[Westeros]]. The first inhabitants of the continent, the [[Children of the Forest]], shaped dragonglass into daggers spearpoints and arrowheads, using it to hunt the ancient forests and defend themselves from the [[giants]], the only other race on Westeros. For this purpose, dragonglass would have served more appropriately than any of the other stones and wood which formed the Children's only resources. Properly filed, it can take an edge sharper than steel, and will last much longer than its wielder. Even today, travellers in the deep woods will occasionally strumble on crude dragonglass arrowheads and spearpoints from the [[Dawn Age|dawn age]]. The [[Valyrians]] used dragonglass to build their strange monuments and buildings without the seams and joints of our modern castles. When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] forged his [[Seven Kingdoms]], he and [[House Targaryen|his descendants]] would decorate their blades of Valyrian steel with dragonglass. There are many theories about how Valyrian was orginally forged ...

[[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Bendleton]]'s treatise on the proper formulation of [[Valyrian steel]], while well researched, is erroneous. He mistakes [[Qohor]]ik iron as an essential component when the Valyrians no doubt used it because of its abundance and the ease of its transport to [[Old Valyria|Valyria]]. Certainly the smiths of Qohor are among the few in the world who can rework Valyrian steel, but even they can't create it anew. The Valyrians forged their incredible steel with [[dragon]]fire and sorcery, and neither Qohorik now nor its [[bloodmagic|blood magic]] can substitute.

Loath as the [[Citadel]] is to acknowledge the word, magic is the only plausible explanation for Valyrian steel properties, unique and peculiar as they are. A Valyrian blade will never lose its edge. Indeed, should one try to sharpen it one will most likely peel the whetstone itself. Light plays oddly across Valyrian steel. In some cases, the blade can seem to glow. In others, the steel drinks so much of the light that it hardly seems visible.

When an acolyte studies the so called [[Magic|higher mysteries]] of the arcane and magical arts, his final test is to stand a solitary vigil in a locked vault with three [[Glass candle|dragonglass candles]]. By this time he has learned of the Valyrian legends that seated before their magically lit candles. Their sorcerers could see across mountains, seas, and deserts. Maester [[Keohane]] discusses this and the properties of Valyrian steel in a lengthy tome. The unique metal is said to consume so much of light that it hardly looks visible or metallic at all. But even without these characteristics, Valyrian steel would be prized for its rarity alone, for most of its finest examples were lost to the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]], as was the art of forging it.

On the subject of magic and sorcery, peasant superstition holds that dragonglass comes from the dragons, though the tales don't specify whether the stone comes from a [[Dragonbone|dragon's bones]], skin, or hardened ...
