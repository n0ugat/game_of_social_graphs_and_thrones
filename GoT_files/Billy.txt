'''Billy''' was a Northern boy orphaned during the [[War of the Five Kings]], and fostered by a [[Winterfell shepherd|shepherd]] near [[Winterfell]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
A [[Winterfell shepherd|shepherd]] reports to [[Bran Stark|Bran]] that he cannot tend to his flock with his three sons fighting in the south; Bran assigns him two orphan boys from the Winterstown named Billy and [[Jack]].{{Ref|GOT205}} Winterfell is later [[Capture of Winterfell|seized]] by [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] but Bran and Rickon escape along with [[Osha]], [[Hodor]], [[Summer]], and [[Shaggydog]]. They pass close by to the shepherd's farm. Theon tracks them there and brutally questions the shepherd who denies having seen them, but [[Dagmer]] finds some walnut shells, which confirms their suspicions that they were there. Theon later returns to Winterfell with the charred corpses of two boys, claiming them to be the Stark boys.{{Ref|GOT207}}

A few days later, however, Luwin spots Osha sneaking into the catacombs. Having accompanied Theon and his fellow [[Ironborn]] occupiers up to the point when they reached the shepherd's farm, Luwin quickly deduces that the corpses, which are still kept on display, must in fact be Jack and Billy. When he meets with Osha later on in the catacombs, he urges her not to tell Bran and Rickon and she readily agrees, but Bran overhears them anyway.{{Ref|GOT208}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Following the [[Sack of Winterfell]], Theon is held prisoner at the [[Dreadfort]] and brutally tortured by a group of men led by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]], who initially presents himself to his prisoner as an Ironborn emissary sent by [[Yara Greyjoy|his sister]]. As Ramsay fumbles around with keys at a locked gate under the pretense of helping Theon escape, Theon confesses to his "savior" of having Dagmer kill two orphans and passing them off as Bran and Rickon.{{Ref|GOT304}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Theon is forced to confess this yet again to [[Roose Bolton]].{{Ref|GOT402}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
When [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] returns to Winterfell to be wed to Ramsay, Ramsay initially forces Theon to keep up the charade and apologize to Sansa for murdering her brothers.{{Ref|GOT505}} Eventually, however, Theon to finally confesses to Sansa that the corpses were "two farm boys."{{Ref|GOT508}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
After escaping Ramsay, Theon decides to part ways with Sansa as she travels north to be reunited with [[Jon Snow|Jon]] at [[Castle Black]]. Though Sansa assures Theon that she will vouch for him, he cites his murder of Billy and Jack as one of the many reasons why he fears Jon will still most likely have him executed.{{Ref|GOT602}}

==Quotes==
===Spoken about Billy===
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Bran Stark|Wait, I know that farm. I sent those two Winterfell orphans there.|Rickon Stark|Jack and Billy! They'll give us some food.|We can't risk it. If Theon tracks us here, he'll torture them until he finds out where we are.|Billy climbs a tree better than anyone.|A Man Without Honor}}
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Osha|Who was that out there...hung from the gates?|Luwin|Must have been the farmer's boys.|He killed them and burned them....and passed them off as the little lords?|Shh, shh, shh. They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.|They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.|[[Osha]] and [[Luwin]] discuss the fate of Jack and Billy.|The Prince of Winterfell}}
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Theon Greyjoy|I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys.|Ramsay Snow|The Stark boys?|Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let [[Dagmer]] slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies... so I could keep Winterfell... and make my father proud.|[[Theon Greyjoy]] confesses his crime to [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]].|And Now His Watch Is Ended}}
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Ramsay Snow|Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?|Theon Greyjoy|No, my lord, just two farm boys.|And crisped them so no one would know.|Yes, my lord.|Theon reveals the truth to Ramsay's father, [[Roose Bolton]].|The Lion and the Rose}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Theon's hunt leads him nowhere, but a freed prisoner from Winterfell named Reek (who is actually [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] in disguise) leads him to a mill, where he remembers there are two boys. They are not orphans but the miller's sons.{{Bookref|ACOK|50}} Both boys are killed with their mother. Later the boys' bodies are treated as in the TV series to cover the Stark boys' escape.{{Bookref|ACOK|56}} It is unknown where the miller was at that time, and how he reacted when he found his wife dead and his sons missing.

Theon does not feel any regret or remorse about killing the boys and their mother (in fact, he does not have regrets about ''any'' of the innocent people who were harmed by him, either personally or at his command). He nonchalantly dismisses that vile deed with "''(t)hey were only miller's sons''".{{Bookref|ADWD|46}}{{Bookref|ADWD|51}} According to the sample chapter of the sixth novel, Theon has convinced himself that "''Reek made him kill those boys, not him Reek but the [[Ramsay Bolton|other one]]''".{{Bookref|TWOW|Theon I}} This isn't correct, because at that point of the story - Ramsay was not in a position to force Theon to do anything; he came up with the idea, but Theon agreed to it, so the blood of the boys (and their mother's) is on both of their hands.
