==Behind the scenes==
[[George R.R. Martin]] uses a turtle as his personal sigil, having kept turtles as pets when he was a child.<ref>http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2012/7/14/seven-moments-from-the-game-of-thrones-comic-con-panel-that.html</ref>

In the audio commentary track for "[[Fire and Blood]]", [[D.B. Weiss]] revealed that they cut the flag for House Estermont because "we cut the turtle out, we didn't want to see a turtle."

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lady Cassana had many siblings including two brothers. The elder, Lord Eldon Estermont, is about 70 years old and head of House Estermont, and the younger, Ser Lomas Estermont, has a son, Ser Andrew. Ser Andrew Estermont had previously been Stannis’s squire for numerous years.

The first time [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] became aware of her husband's infidelity was when they repaid a visit to the Estermonts. she was miserable the entire fortnight they spent with the Estermonts while Robert enjoyed hunting, hawking, drinking, and play fighting with his maternal uncles and male cousins. He also took to reconnecting and comforting a female cousin, whose father and husband died in the [[Siege of Storm's End]] and eventually spent the night with her. That same night, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] offered to kill Robert, but Cersei said she wanted him "horned" instead. She likes to think that was the night when her son [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] was conceived.

Following the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Lord Eldon bends the knee to King Joffrey, though some members of House Estermont remain loyal to Stannis.
