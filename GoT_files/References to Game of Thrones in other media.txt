==''[http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page The Office]''==
*In the American version of ''[[Wikipedia:The Office (U.S. TV series)|The Office]]'', in the episode "[[Wikipedia:Andy's Ancestry|Andy's Ancestry]]", the [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki language]] figures into the plot. Erin wants to impress Andy's intellectual family, each of whom speak more than one language, by picking a new language to learn herself. Her coworker Dwight, a sci-fi and fantasy nerd, knows Dothraki - openly admitting to her that it is an artificial language from a TV show - and suggests to her that it is a great language to learn. Later in the episode, he is seen giving her an ''accurate'' lesson in Dothraki on a chart: ''foth aggendak'' (I throat-rip), ''foth aggendi'' (you throat-rip), ''foth aggenda'' (he/she/it throat-rips). [[David J. Peterson]], the linguist who created the Dothraki language, analyzed the episode's Dothraki dialogue on his blog and confirmed that it was accurate - though he said he was not consulted himself, and thus the writers of ''The Office'' must have just researched instructional guides he had previously released about Dothraki.<ref>[http://www.dothraki.com/2012/10/dothraki-on-the-office/ ]</ref>
**Following up on this, a parody sequence during the 2011 Emmy Awards depicted characters from various shows on the set of ''The Office'', giving in-universe interviews to the camera in the format of that show. They are asked how they feel about their work environment, and are all complaining about their co-workers. Randomly, a Dothraki warrior appears who complains that he's tired of other warriors who always forget to wash out the blood from the bowl they keep [[Stallion heart|horse hearts]] in. In the next shot, Amy Poehler, as Leslie Knope, delivers her line in Dothraki.

She replies that she can give him the entire Targaryen speech from season 1, but she won't waste her breath.

*In the inaugural US Red Nose Day, the band Coldplay - whose drummer [[Will Champion]] appeared in the show - as well as current and former members of the cast collaborated in a sketch about an awful musical version of ''Game of Thrones''. George RR Martin's reaction leads to the spectacle's cancellation.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/coldplay/videos/10155563398050253/?pnref=story Facebook: Coldplay's Game of Thrones: The Musical (Full 12-minute version)]</ref>

==''[http://muppet.wikia.com/wiki/Sesame_Street Sesame Street]''==
[[File:GameofChairs.png|thumb|250px|The Sesame Street parody "Game of Chairs".]]
*In the realm of "Jesteros", a "Game of Chairs" is held to determine who will be the new king or queen. Muppet versions are present of [[Eddard Stark|Ned]], [[Robb Stark|Robb]], Cersei, [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], [[Melisandre]], and Daenerys. Grover is known as "Grover [[House Greyjoy|Bluejoy]]", and keeps getting the rules wrong. Grover wears a hat of bells - like Jinglebell Frey in the novels. The three chairs they use in their "Game of Chairs" are each made out of game equipment: one out of baseball bats, one out of golf clubs, and one out of table tennis paddles. When Joffrey loses a round because he hesitated to grab a chair, Grover says "Sorry, [[Purple Wedding|looks like you choked]], Joffrey". Robb and Cersei are in the last round, but both trip and Grover ends up on the throne. Tyrion crowns him king. Cersei is upset and leaves shouting she's going to tell [[Jaime Lannister|her brother]]. Robb says he can't imagine [[Red Wedding|an ending more horrible]] for himself than this. Ned is upset that Grover won, but Grover says "[[Baelor|Don't lose your head over this]], Nedy baby." Grover then asks Tyrion to get a cushion so he can rest on the throne more easily. Grover then shivers and notes that it is getting cold, so he also tells Tyrion to get him a sweater, because "winter is coming".<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/wall-nuts-more-ozzy-man-a-new-quick-draw-and-a-sesame-street-game-of-thrones-parody/ Wall Nuts: More Ozzy Man, a new Quick Draw, and a Sesame Street Game of Thrones parody]</ref>

*One of the shows shown on the parody channel HBOWTIME is ''Game of Thrones''.
*The Simpsons do a parody couch gag of the ''Game of Thrones'' opening sequence.
*The intro advert for Homer as Duffman is a parody of the hit fantasy HBO show ''Game of Thrones'' and later Homer recites an oath that parodies the [[Night's Watch]]'s oath.
*In the episode "The Book Job", Selma mentions that she speaks Dothraki.

==''[http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/South_Park_Archives South Park]''==
*Mr. Garrison teaches a history class in which the topic is actually an accurate explanation of the political history in Westeros during ''Game of Thrones.''

==="Black Friday", "A Song of Ass and Fire", and "Titties and Dragons"===
[[File:BlackFriday1.png|250px|thumb|George R.R. Martin in South Park.]]
*South Park made an episode trilogy called "Black Friday" which parodied both ''Game of Thrones'' and author [[George R.R. Martin]].
*Within the three-part episode itself, everyone has watched ''Game of Thrones'' and use it as a guide for their actions.
*A running joke throughout "Black Friday" is satirizing how characters in ''Game of Thrones'' frequently discuss political intrigue while walking through the castle gardens in [[King's Landing]]. In the Season 4 Blu-ray commentary, [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] revealed that they saw the ''South Park'' parody, and in response, consciously stopped having characters do this quite as frequently. The TV series even references the joke in Season 4's "[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]", when [[Olenna Tyrell]] is getting ready to leave King's Landing while walking with Margaery in the gardens, which she notes has become tedious, saying: "If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs". <ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/game-of-thrones/243771/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4 ]</ref>
* The mall security is analogous to the Night's Watch and the South Park Mall is analogous to the Wall.
*Butters even visits [[George R.R. Martin]] at his home in Sante Fe to ask how the series will end, so he can tell them what to do in the upcoming conflict.
*Martin's appearance in the cartoon mocks how the release date for the books was stretched back by many years, while Martin insists that the best parts are "on their way". Thus, instead of telling Butters and Scott the information they need, Martin, who is depicted as a simple-minded dim-wit with a fixation for male "wieners". Rather than giving them useful information, he chatters nonstop on (greatly exaggerated from the canon) penis related-content from the books from the beginning, till the kids nearly freak out. This is continued into the final part, when Martin takes far too long to cut the ribbon at the mall to open the Black Friday sale (which ultimately leads to him being castrated by an irate shopper).
**Butters insists that the dragons haven't "shown up yet" even though he also says he watched to the end of Season 3. Actually, the dragons ''have'' shown up starting from the finale of Season 1, "[[Fire and Blood]]", but a complaint even among book fans is that they're still juveniles and don't do much yet (i.e. for all of book/Season 2 they're basically just the size of cats). Even as of the most current book, Daenerys's dragons are only just on the verge of being big enough to ride. Thus Butter's point generally stands: epic battles with people riding huge adult dragons into battle were promised, but the dragons take five books to grow to such a size.
*Butters insists that he's annoyed how the TV series shows too many "wieners" and not enough dragons. Actually, a fan complaint is that the instances of male full frontal nudity have been extremely rare and drastically out of proportion compared to the massive number of female nude scenes. ''CollegeHumor.com'' went so far as to make a parody video, consisting of a fake fan PSA in which female fans plead with HBO to "show more dongs" on ''Game of Thrones''.<ref>[http://www.collegehumor.com/video/6905751/hbo-should-show-dongs CollegeHumor.com], "HBO Should Show Dongs".</ref>
**Butters makes a point that HBO can't show an erect penis on TV, but this strains the credibility of scenes for him, i.e. that [[Theon Greyjoy]]'s penis is flacid ''immediately'' after he finishes penetrating the prostitute [[Ros]], when it logically shouldn't be. Meanwhile, Butters notes that they ''can'' show an erect penis for a gay man, because this must be less offensive or frightening - apparently the sex scene between Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] and [[Olyvar]] in Season 3's "[[Kissed by Fire]]".
*When Martin answers the door, he initially assumes that Butters is another fan here to complain that he was traumatized by the [[Red Wedding]].
*Martin tells Butters "there is a young blacksmith who wakes up one morning with a plan" - presumably referring to [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]].
*Despite drastically exaggerating the number of penises involved, South Park's version of George R.R. Martin gave a fairly accurate (and ''spoiler filled'') summation of the events of the [[Purple Wedding]].  This episode aired in November/December 2013, during the break after Season 3, before the Purple Wedding occurred in early Season 4, and thus risked spoiling viewers who haven't read the books.
*Kenny McCormick cosplays as [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. Actually, Kenny's costume was originally developed for the South Park video game ''The Stick of Truth'', and is modeled on Princess Zelda - thus explaining why it has several Japanese ''anime'' tropes including a "magical girlfriend" heart-shaped emblem. It looks similar enough to Daenerys that Kenny simply re-used it for his ''Game of Thrones'' cosplay.
**Some wondered if South Park was actually able to get Emilia Clarke to record Kenny's inner "Princess McCormick" monologue voice. According to IMDB, the voice of "Princess Kenny" was actually provided by actress Caitlin Gallogly - doing a spot-on Emilia Clarke impression.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4743504/]</ref>
*Tweek cosplays as Khal [[Drogo]].
*The TV anchors are a brother-sister team having an [[Incest|incestuous]] sexual relationship, like [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister]].
*Many times when the narrative cuts to the President of Sony, the scene begins with him having sex with someone - for no real reason. This is apparently making fun of the alleged "[[Sexposition]]" technique used on the TV show, in which important but lengthy exposition will be made more exciting by placing it during a sex scene. The twist later on is that the President of Sony even has sex with Niles the reporter (who continues to use his reporter-voice as if he was reporting on a traffic accident, etc.)
*The mobs of people swarming around the shopping mall before Black Friday are treated like the [[Wight]]-zombies, while the shopping mall security guards are an analogue of the [[Night's Watch]].
*The [[heraldry]] of several major Houses is accurately depicted in the background of several scenes, including the direwolf of [[House Stark]]. The colors for the [[House Targaryen]] and [[House Baratheon]] sigils are reversed: the Targaryen heraldry is a red dragon on a black background and the Baratheon heraldry is a black stag on a golden background, but the episode depicts a black dragon on a red background and a golden stag on a black background respectively. Then again, in the former case, it ''is'' an accurate depiction of the heraldry of [[House Blackfyre]], a cadet branch of House Targaryen which intentionally reversed the colors, and the banners at Winterfell were changed from the regular House Stark banners to banners with an inverted color scheme (a white Direwolf on a grey background) to reflect Jon Snow's bastard status after he retook the castle from the Boltons. Thus, this can be assumed to be a common practice in Westeros reguarding bastards gaining status, making the inverted Baratheon banners semi-cannon.
*The Red Robin Wedding is, of course, a parody of the [[Red Wedding]].
*Randy Marsh says: "Peterson was a great guy, and he did not deserve to get beheaded like that. Now I don't know about you, but I am sick and tired of getting to know people here, getting invested in their personalities and their back stories, and then having them die!" - this can be reference to the killing off of major Game of Thrones characters that are favored by the fans, mainly [[Eddard Stark]].
*Cartman excuses himself during the wedding, saying he needs to use the restroom - a reference to [[Roose Bolton]] (in the TV series he was replaced with [[Brynden Tully]]), who left the dining hall for similar reason shortly before the massacre began.
*The middle episodes end with ''Game of Thrones''-style cliffhanger shots. In part 1, Kenny's pet rat perches on his shoulder similar to how Daenerys Targaryen's newly hatched dragon did in the Season 1 finale. In part 2, a zombie-shopper screams at the camera just as the White Walker did in the Season 2 finale as it led an army of wight-zombies to attack the Night's Watch camp.

==''[[Wikipedia:Suits|Suits]]''==
* All of the major characters of the show, follow ''Game of Thrones'' and often reference and mention it, especially Louis Litt.
*The episode ''Shame'' sees Louis imagining his very own walk of shame.

==''[http://supernatural.wikia.com/wiki/Supernatural_Wiki Supernatural]''==
*In the fourth episode of the ninth season, "Slumber Party", Dean picks up Season 1 of ''Game of Thrones'' as an escape and watches it with Sam and Charlie. After finishing, Dean says "Wow, that Joffrey's a dick." Charlie expresses the lack of adventure in their jobs as monster hunters by exclaiming "Where are my White Walkers?"
*In the fourteenth episode of the eleventh season, "The Vessel", a character says "[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Men of Letters send their regards]]" before killing a monster.
*In the twenty-second episode of the eleventh season, "We Happy Few", former lord of Hell, Crowley, calls the situations in Heaven and Hell "A game of thrones: it's musical chairs".

[[File:Westworld_Pin_on_Logan.jpg|thumb|200px]]
*In Season 1 of HBO's Westworld, Logan gestured to a pin on his lapel while telling William that he had been promoted to an army major. The design looks very much like the sigil for the "Hand of the King".
* [[George R.R. Martin]] has been quoted as saying: "That's not the first time the two shows would have collided." Martin has said that he'd love to do a crossover episode between the two HBO shows.
[[File:Westworld_direwolf.jpg|right|200px]]
* "Westworld" showrunners — Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy — replied to the Martin's remarks to Entertainment Weekly: "[Martin's]" a lovely guy and a stunning writer and it's flattering he would encourage a crossover," Nolan told EW. "We should be so lucky."
* In the season 1 finale episode titled "The Bicameral Mind", there is a scene with Dolores Abernathy shortly after the episode begins. She is standing in a mass of killed Hosts, when a small snowflake falls into view and shortly after a wolf runs through the field of bodies before disappearing; There is no other explanation for why this happened in the rest of the episode, other than Westworld is paying one last homage to Game of Thrones.<ref>http://www.mtv.com/news/2960258/westworld-recap-may-all-women-transform-into-the-vengeful-world-destroyers-we-are-destined-to-become/</ref>

== ''[[Wikipedia:nl:Zondag met Lubach|Zondag met Lubach]]'' ==
*Two days after the final episode of [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|Season 7]] there was a video released on YouTube that was called "Westeros the Series". The video included some shots of [[Braavos]] and the [[Wall]] set in present time and a Lannister that was depicted as a prime minister. The video went viral and at September the 4th a second video revealed that the video was a spoof.
