This is the official [[HBO]] '''pronunciation guide''' developed by the TV series's production staff and given to the actors during the filming of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The guide was later released on the official HBO website for the series.<ref>Cogman, Bryan (February 11, 2011).

Note that this article is not a comprehensive guide to name pronunciation on the TV series, but is an archive of the specific pronunciation guide that the production team developed and circulated to the actors in [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]]. As such, it covers most but not all of the names used in Season 1, particularly major characters and locations. Moreover, it doesn't include characters introduced after Season 1.

Writer [[Bryan Cogman]] clarified that some pronunciations would differ due to the accents and languages of the speaker. "Ser" in particular will vary.

==Behind the scenes==
As the guide notes, "Arya" is pronounced "ARE - yuh". George R.R. Martin himself has pointed out that a surprisingly large number of people pronounce it incorrectly: it consists of two syllables, not three (like how the "aria" of an opera is pronounced). Martin explained: "I say it 'Are-ya', two syllables not three. Not 'are-ee-uh', not like an operatic thing, but 'Are-ya', very sharp. I wanted something that was like a knife, that was a sharp and hard sound, to be a contrast to the flowery 'Sansa'."<ref>[http://youtu.be/DOEO27SZAtw?t=3m]</ref>

Also, in [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]] and [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]] the pronunciation of "Tyrell" has become notoriously inconsistent: actors have been pronouncing it different ways even within the same scenes, alternating between "TI-rul" and "Tie-rell".  "Tyrell" is a real life name, however, and in real life there is actually no consistent pronunciation of the name "Tyrell" either.  

According to the pronunciation guide, "Qarth" is pronounced "QUARTH". However, in "[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]" when Daenerys first pronounces it as "Kwarth" she is corrected by the [[Spice King]] that it is actually "KARTH". The original pronunciation guide may have been in error. Either way, "Karth" is the pronunciation that is actually used on-screen.

The pronunciation guide states that "''khaleesi''" is pronounced "khal-EE-see", and this is how characters consistently pronounce it on-screen.  However, professional linguist [[David J. Peterson]], who developed the Dothraki language for the TV series, has frequently remarked that according to the pronunciation rules of Dothraki, the "real" pronunciation should be "KHAH-lay-see", with the emphasis on the first syllable, not the second syllable.<ref>[http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonotactics#Stress ]</ref><ref>[http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonology ]</ref>
