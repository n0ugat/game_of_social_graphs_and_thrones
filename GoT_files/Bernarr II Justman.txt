King '''Bernarr II Justman'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was a [[River King|King of the Trident]].

==Biography==
When [[Qhored Hoare]], [[King of the Iron Islands]], invaded the [[Riverlands]], he defeated [[King]] Bernarr and took his three young sons as hostages. After Bernarr's tribute to the [[Ironborn]] king was late, Qhored cut out their hearts with his own hands. Bernarr sought revenge and marched his army against Qhored, who defeated him and drowned him as a sacrifice to the [[Drowned God]].{{Ref|H&L602}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bernarr's story is the same. His death rendered [[House Justman]] extinct and threw the [[Riverlands]] into a century of anarchy.
