{{Quote|... when I first saw the stone walls of Riverrun rising from the Trident, towering over me, back then, I was a little more easily impressed. The boy in me thought the gods themselves must live in such a place. I soon learned otherwise.|[[Petyr Baelish]]|House Baelish (short)}}
'''Riverrun'''{{Ref|GOT104}} is the seat of [[House Tully]], which was once occupied by [[House Frey]]. 

==History==
===Background===
Riverrun is the seat of [[House Tully]], the [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|Lord Paramounts]] of the [[Trident]] and the [[Riverlands]]. It was built as an island fortress by [[Axel Tully]]. Prior to the [[War of the Five Kings]], Lord [[Hoster Tully]] is the [[Lord of Riverrun]].<ref>"[[House Tully (short)|House Tully]]"</ref> [[Petyr Baelish]] recalls being fostered at Riverrun during his childhood and being enamoured by its high walls.<ref>"[[House Baelish (short)|House Baelish]]"</ref>

The castle located in the central-western part of the [[Riverlands]]. It sits at the point where the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]] River is joined by its major tributary, the [[Tumblestone]] River flowing out of the west. In times of danger, sluice gates can be opened to flood a channel cut to the west of the castle, turning Riverrun into an island. Its walls rise sheer from the waters and its towers command the opposite shores, making assaulting it almost impossible without huge casualties.

==Behind the scenes==
The grounds of [[wikipedia:Gosford Castle|Gosford Castle]] in [[wikipedia:County Armagh|County Armagh, Northern Ireland]] were used for Riverrun exteriors during Season 3.<ref>Miller, Susan (August 3, 2012). [http://winteriscoming.net/2012/08/day-26-gosford-castle-as-riverrun Day 26: Gosford Castle as Riverrun] WinterIsComing.Net</ref>

The design was loosely based on [[Wikipedia:Château de Chenonceau|Château de Chenonceau]].<ref>audio commentary from [[Gemma Jackson]] for "[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"</ref>

The word "riverrun" is also the first word in James Joyce's final novel, ''Finnegans Wake''.<ref>https://www.finwake.com/1024chapter1/fw01.htm</ref> This is the book that Dan Weiss wrote his thesis on while studying at Trinity College Dublin, where he and David Benioff met for the first time. <ref>https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2014/03/game-of-thrones-benioff-weiss-interview</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Riverrun is a triangular castle made of sandstone. It is located at the confluence of the [[Tumblestone]] and the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]].

Riverrun has been in the possession of [[House Tully]] for a thousand years, and it became the seat of rule over the region when House Tully rebelled against the [[ironborn]] occupiers of the [[Riverlands]] and allied with [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] three centuries ago.

Prior to the [[Red Wedding]], [[Robb Stark]] leaves [[Brynden Tully]] holding Riverrun as "Warden of the Southern Marches", overseeing the defenses of the Stark-loyal territories of the Riverlands, and protecting his Queen, Jeyne Westerling (the book's counterpart of [[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]]), who also remains at Riverrun.

Following the Red Wedding, according to the agreement between [[Tywin Lannister]] and the [[House Frey|Freys]], Riverrun is granted to Emmon Frey, the second son of Lord [[Walder Frey]] and husband of Tywin's sister Genna. Ryman Frey leads two thousand spears to take Riverrun, reinforced by Lannister troops led by Ser Daven Lannister, the new [[Warden of the West]], and several Riverlords that bent the knee following the Red Wedding. However, Brynden anticipates the siege. He gathers all the foodstuffs and goods he can within the castle, expels all the unnecessary mouths, and prepares for a long siege.

As in the show, [[Edmure Tully]] accepts [[Jaime Lannister]]'s terms and yields the castle, but he helps his uncle Brynden escape. Emmon Frey takes his place as Lord of Riverrun.
