{{Quote|Did your brother's head keep on its way back to you, Willem? I heard the maggots got to it.|Amos Bracken to Willem Blackwood|Regent (episode)}}
Lord '''Samwell Blackwood'''{{Ref|HOTD203}} was the Lord of [[Raventree Hall]] and head of [[House Blackwood]] during the reigns of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]] and [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]].

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
The [[Small Council]] discuss a complaint made by Lord Blackwood to the crown that [[House Bracken]] is illegally annexing Blackwood lands. They eventually dismiss this as a problem that would be better handled by Lord [[Grover Tully]], the liege lord to the Blackwoods and Brackens. [[Lyman Beesbury]] belatedly adds his opinion that the Blackwoods have the upper hand.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] states that Samwell Blackwood was among the many casualties suffered in the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}

After his death, Samwell is succeeded by his son [[Benjicot Blackwood|Benjicot]], with his brother, [[Willem Blackwood|Willem]], acting as regent.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

[[Amos Bracken]] taunts Willem about Samwell's death during his parley with [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Samwell Blackwood lost a duel with [[Amos Bracken]] over [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s hand (in the show, this duel transpired between [[Willem Blackwood]] and [[Jerrel Bracken]]). Samwell later succeeded his father as Lord of Raventree.
