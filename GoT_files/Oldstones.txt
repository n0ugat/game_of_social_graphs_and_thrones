'''Oldstones'''{{Ref|GOT705}} is a location in the [[Riverlands]], near the headwaters of the [[Blue Fork]] of the [[Trident]]. [[Jenny of Oldstones]] once lived there.{{Ref|GOT705}} It was once ruled by the [[River King]]s of [[House Mudd]].{{Note|The song "[[Jenny of Oldstones (song)|Jenny of Oldstones]]" mentions an extinct line of kings.}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Oldstones is so-called because it is the ruins of an ancient castle, of the petty local kings who ruled over the [[First Men]]. They were wiped out by the [[coming of the Andals]] and the castle was never rebuilt in the next 6,000 years.

When [[Robb Stark]]'s army rides back north from [[Riverrun]] to the [[Twins]] for the wedding of Edmure Tully, they pass the ruins of Oldstones. Their situation in the war has become dire, and seeing the ruins causes [[Catelyn Stark]] to become reflective on whether this will be their fate as well: left as nothing but half-forgotten, decaying ruins.
