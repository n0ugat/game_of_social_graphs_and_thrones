The '''Red Waste'''{{Ref|GOT201}} is a desert region on the continent of [[Essos]], located thousands of miles to the east of [[Westeros]]. It is located south of the [[Dothraki Sea]] and [[Lhazar]], northwest of [[Qarth]], and east of [[Slaver's Bay]]. It is a harsh sandy wilderness that even the [[Dothraki]] fear to cross.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
After pillaging the lands of Lhazar, the Dothraki ''[[khalasar]]'' of [[Drogo]] skirts the northern edge of the Red Waste.<ref>"[[Baelor]]"</ref> It is in these border regions where Drogo falls from his horse and his ''khalasar'' scatters, and also where [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] hatches her [[dragon]] eggs.<ref>"[[Fire and Blood]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[File:Dany-wasteSeason2.jpg|thumb|Daenerys in the Red Waste.]]
Daenerys and her retainers travel across the Red Waste in search of succor. After [[Daenerys Targaryen's mare|Daenerys's mare]] dies from lack of water, she sends three of her [[bloodrider]]s in search of civilization. [[Jorah Mormont]] tells Daenerys that he has not been as far east as the Red Waste, but he has heard that it does have an end and it is possible to cross it.<ref>"[[The North Remembers]]"</ref> One of Daenerys's bloodriders, [[Rakharo]], is executed by a Dothraki ''khalasar'' and his head sent back to her.<ref>"[[The Night Lands]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Red Waste is extremely large, taking weeks to cross, and is unrelentingly hostile. Water is scarce and food sources almost non-existent. The wasteland is located east of [[Slaver's Bay]] and west of the [[Jade Sea]]. The city of [[Qarth]] lies southeast of the waste. Its southern edge runs along the [[Summer Sea]].

There are ruins in the waste, suggesting that at one time it was much more pleasant and habitable than now. One such ruined city is called Vaes Tolorro (the City of Bones) by Daenerys. According to the ''World of Ice and Fire'' sourcebook, several of the ruined cities were actually colonies of the Qaathi, the culture that gave rise to [[Qarth]], which were destroyed by the [[Dothraki]] when they swept across Essos after the Doom of Valyria, during the [[Century of Blood]]. The Dothraki never reached as far as Qarth itself, however, because of the vast distance across the Red Waste, which was already forming long before the Doom. The Qaathi's oasis-colonies were only suitable for habitation due to the large irrigation projects they created to continue living in the expanding desert, but when the Dothraki sacked them these were destroyed, and ruins were reclaimed by the desert.

The Red Waste is not strictly speaking a true "rolling sands" desert, though it is a desert in the broad definition that it receives virtually no rainfall - more precisely, a rocky desert. It is actually far more harsh and dangerous than even a dry sandy desert, due to its low rocky hills, barren windswept plains, and dry riverbeds. It is more of a blasted wasteland than a simple sandy desert, which explains why it is known as the "Red Waste" and not simply the "Red Desert".
