{{Quote|It's good luck to rub a dwarf's head.|Brothel guard to Tyrion Lannister|High Sparrow (episode)}}
A '''brothel guard''' guards the door at a [[Pleasure house|brothel]] located in the [[Long Bridge]] of [[Volantis]].

==Biography==
===Background===
He guards the door at a [[Pleasure house|brothel]] located in the [[Long Bridge]] of [[Volantis]]. He just speaks the [[Low Valyrian]] of Astapor.{{Ref|GOT503}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
When [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Varys]] are about to enter the brothel this man is guarding, the guard rubs Tyrion's head, citing in that it is good luck to rub a [[dwarf]]'s head. Tyrion quips that it is better luck to "suck his cock."{{Ref|GOT503}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the man who rubs Tyrion's head is not a brothel guard but one of the tiger cloaks, the city guards of Volantis and its affiliate cities (such as [[Selhorys]], where the scene takes place). Tyrion is too startled to resist; he asks his escort Haldon why the man did that. Haldon speaks with the guard in a language that Tyrion does not understand, and explains that the man says it is good luck to rub a dwarf's head. Tyrion forces himself to smile at the man and says "Tell him that it is even better luck to suck on a dwarf's cock"; Haldon responds "Best not. Tigers have been known to have sharp teeth."
