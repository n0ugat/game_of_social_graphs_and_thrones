A '''Gold Cloak''' and [[Gold Cloak 1 (Eastwatch)|his partner]] confront [[Davos Seaworth]] and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] as they are readying to leave [[King's Landing]]. At first, Davos manages to pay them off, but upon seeing [[Tyrion Lannister]], they grow suspicious and Gendry kills them both.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Two Gold Cloaks approach Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] as they are about to leave [[King's Landing]] in a boat. Davos offers to pay them to look the other way, and they demand fifteen [[Money|gold dragons]] each. They ask what is in the boat, and Davos shows them baskets filled with fermented crab, which he claims improves a man's sexual prowess. The Gold Cloaks each have a taste and leave to go to a brothel, but see [[Tyrion Lannister]] making his way towards the boat. Recognizing him, they demand to know if he is the [[dwarf]] they have been searching for. Davos offers to give them more gold, which distracts them long enough for [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] to cave their heads in with his warhammer.{{Ref|GOT705}}
