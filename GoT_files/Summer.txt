'''Summer''' was one of six [[direwolf]] pups found by the children of [[House Stark]]. Summer is adopted and raised by [[Bran Stark]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Summer was adopted as a pup with the rest of his siblings when [[Eddard Stark]] and his entourage came upon the pups and their deceased mother. At the request of [[Jon Snow]], the pups were spared and each Stark child adopted one as their own. Bran names his direwolf Summer.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Summer1x01.jpg|thumb|Summer watches as Bran climbs.]]
Summer followed Bran around wherever he climbed until one day, while climbing a broken tower, Bran witnesses [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] having sex with [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. When they see the boy, Jaime runs over to Bran and grabs him. He pokes his head out the window and upon seeing there is nobody except Summer, he pushes Bran out the window, leaving him comatose and crippled.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Summer.png|thumb|Summer lays beside Bran with a bloody muzzle after saving him.]]
As Bran lies in bed, an [[Catspaw|assassin]] tries to kill him, but Summer kills the assassin. The direwolf then climbs onto the bed and lays next to Bran in order to protect him from anyone else who may come to harm his master.
Shortly afterwards, [[Lady]] is killed at Cersei's demand.{{Ref|GOT102}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===

Later, Bran wargs into Summer and sees Jon being accosted by [[Free Folk|wildlings]].

[[File:Beyond_-_Cave_4x10.png|thumb|Summer, Bran and the rest of the group arrive at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven.]]
When Bran hears a baby crying, Bran wargs into Summer to have a look. While heading towards the baby, however, he gets distracted by the cry of another direwolf. He goes to have a look and sees that it is his brother Ghost locked up in a cage. Summer runs over to Ghost but falls into a trap. Bran refuses to leave Summer and Ghost behind. Bran and his companions are captured by the [[mutineers]] at [[Craster's Keep]] attempting to free Summer. They later escape when the keep is [[Raid on Craster's Keep|raided]] by loyal members of the Night's Watch led by Jon.{{Ref|GOT404}}

Bran and his companions are attacked by numerous [[wight]]s outside the weirwood tree of the Three-Eyed Raven. Summer saves Bran from one of the wights that was right on top of him.

[[File:Roman Papsuev - Bran Stark and Hodor.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Bran Stark and Hodor by Roman "Amok" Papsuev.©]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Summer is fiercely defensive of Bran, but is arguably the most playful of the six pups. He is colored silver and smoky grey, with yellow eyes. Bran names him after waking up from his coma and later mentions, ".... he was the smartest of the litter".

Summer is still alive by the point the novels reached.
