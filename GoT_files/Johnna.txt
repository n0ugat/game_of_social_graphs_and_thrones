'''Johnna''' is a wildling who resides at [[Hardhome]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Johnna resides in Hardhome with her [[Karsi|mother]] and [[Willa (Hardhome)|sister]].{{Ref|GOT508}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Johnna and her sister Willa are evacuated from Hardhome after Karsi agrees to [[Tormund]] and [[Jon Snow]]'s plan to resettle the wildlings in the [[Gift]], in exchange for military support when the [[White Walkers]] finally assail the [[Wall]]. As she loads them into a boat, Johnna and her sister ask Karsi if she'll go with them, to which their mother replies that she'll follow shortly. Karsi is killed shortly thereafter in the [[Massacre at Hardhome]], but her daughters at that point have reached the safety of the Night's Watch ships.{{Ref|GOT508}}

Johnna and Willa later march with Tormund and Jon as part of the Wildling host when they arrive at [[Castle Black]].{{Ref|GOT509}}
