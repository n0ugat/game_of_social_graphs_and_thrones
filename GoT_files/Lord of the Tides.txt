'''Lord of the Tides'''{{Ref|HOTD101}} is a title held by the ruler of the stronghold of [[Driftmark]] in [[Blackwater Bay]]. The title is traditionally held by the head of [[House Velaryon]], along with the title of [[Master of Driftmark]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] is the Lord of the Tides during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]].{{Ref|HOTD101}} His son, [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]], stands to inherit the title.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

After what the public perceives to be death of Laenor Velaryon, his second son [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] becomes the heir to Driftmark, as his first son [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] stands to inherit the [[Iron Throne]] instead.{{Ref|HOTD107}}{{Ref|HOTD108}} Corlys's wife [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] objects to this, believing that [[Laena Velaryon|Laena]]'s daughter [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] is the rightful heir on account of Lucerys in truth being the [[bastard]] son of [[Harwin Strong]]. She later relents after agreeing to marry Baela and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] to Jacaerys and Lucerys, ensuring that the Velaryon bloodline continues to rule Driftmark in the future, but Corlys's brother [[Vaemond Velaryon|Vaemond]] remains belligerent, petitioning the crown to make himself the next Lord of the Tides should Corlys die of his recent wounds in the [[War for the Stepstones]]. He oversteps by openly insulting Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], however, and is promptly executed by [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]]. King Viserys confirms Lucerys as the next Lord of the Tides.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Lucerys dies before he can inherit the title, making his younger brother [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] the new heir.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==Known Lords of the Tides==
*[[Daemon Velaryon]]
*[[Corlys Velaryon]]

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the title is the same. The Lord of the Tides at the start of ''A Game of Thrones'' is Monford Velaryon, and Monterys Velaryon at the end of ''A Dance with Dragons''.

After becoming a pirate king in the [[Stepstones]], Aurane Waters, a Velaryon bastard, styles himself the "Lord of the Waters" as a play on his bastard name and the title "Lord of the Tides."
