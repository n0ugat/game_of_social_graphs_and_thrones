'''Greenstone'''<ref>[[:File:House Baratheon lineage page 3.png]]</ref> is a castle in the [[Stormlands]]. It is the seat of [[House Estermont]], a vassal sworn to [[House Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Greenstone is the seat of House Estermont. 

King [[Robert Baratheon]], along with Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] and some of the court from [[King's Landing]], including Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] of the [[Kingsguard]], spent a fortnight at Greenstone. Robert cheated on Cersei with a cousin of his; Cersei believes that it was there that she and Jaime conceived their eldest child [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. Jaime called the castle "Greenshit".

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', a force of the [[Golden Company]] captures Greenstone on behalf of the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia who has returned to Westeros to claim the [[Iron Throne]].
