==Narration==
'''Margaery Tyrell''': ''Some Great Houses call [[House Tyrell|us]] upstarts, but the truth is that while the [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] fell to the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] in defeat, [[House Tyrell]] rose.''

''For thousands of years, our family served as loyal [[Steward|stewards]] to the [[King of the Reach|Kings of the Reach]]. Until the [[Mern IX Gardener|last of their line]] unwisely [[Field of Fire|burned]] to death, resisting the [[Aegon's Conquest|Targaryen invaders]].''

''To save the [[Reach]] from a similar fate, we yielded [[Highgarden]] to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|his]] [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|sisters]]. In gratitude, the Targaryens gave House Tyrell dominion over the Reach, and we became [[Lord of Highgarden|lords]] of the castle in which, for generations, we had served.''

''Under the Targaryen dynasty, [[Westeros]] prospered. Gone were the petty wars of Seven Kingdoms and the endless thirst for minor glories that drove them.''

''The [[Westerlands]] enriched the realm, the [[North]] guarded it, and the Reach and [[Riverlands]] fed it. This harmony is what [[Robert Baratheon]] shattered with his [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] against [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]].''

''When the call to arms came, though, we did not want to answer. The Reach is a gentle land, and, honestly, the Mad King was not much loved. But we owed peace and status to his family.''

''My father, [[Mace Tyrell]], called his banners and marched north to battle the rogue Storm Lord, Robert, who had already [[Battle of Summerhall|defeated]] three forces in a single day. And, at [[Ashford]], my father [[Battle of Ashford|won]].''

''Some chasten my father for not pursuing Robert after the battle. We had cut him off from the Stormlands, the seat of his power, and he had fled north, within easy grasp of Lord [[Tywin Lannister]], the [[Hand of the King|Hand]] of Aerys for twenty years.''

''My father moved instead to lay siege of Robert's ancestral stronghold of [[Storm's End]]. The rose would strangle the stag as the lion pounced. So we waited. But the lion slumbered, and Robert slipped past the King's forces to join [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]].''

''We could have lifted the siege and deployed our armies north to aid the Crown. We ''could'' have stormed the walls of the castle and made Robert homeless. But we had ample supplies, control of land and sea, and, most of all, patience.''

''Our siege would succeed, eventually, at little cost of life to us. If Robert prolonged the war with minor victories, our capture of Storm's End would hasten his downfall.''

''And if Robert won the war, well, it would not do for him to find us within his walls with the bodies of his brother Stannis and his sworn men.''

''When the lion finally showed his colors and "[[Sack of King's Landing|purged]]" [[King's Landing]], we knew our cause was lost. My father chose the peaceful route and bent the knee to Robert, who heartily pardoned us. Strange, considering how we had beaten him and starved his brother to the brink of death.''

''We were to keep our lands, castle, and title, But we knew we would never be welcome at court. It didn't matter. The Reach was still the most fertile of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and under our hand.''

''Every flower, even the rose, needs pruning. Then it grows strong.''
