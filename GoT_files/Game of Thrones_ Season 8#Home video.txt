{{Quote|The Long Night is coming, and the dead come with it.|[[Jon Snow]]|Hardhome (episode)}}
After eight thousand years of standing between the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]] and the [[Beyond the Wall|lands beyond]], the inevitable has finally happened - the [[Wall]] has been [[Breaching of the Wall|breached]]: Mounted on the [[Wight|reanimated]] corpse of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s [[dragon]] [[Viserion]], the [[Night King]] has [[Breaching of the Wall|blasted through the ancient fortification]] and obliterated the castle of [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. The [[Wight|army of the dead]], now numbering over 100,000 wights as well as the [[White Walkers]], is heading straight towards the [[North]], bringing a winter that will become another [[Long Night]], one which may last forever.

Unfortunately, the political and military strife within the Seven Kingdoms is not yet over. Though the [[War of the Five Kings]] is long ended, control of the [[Iron Throne]] is still being contested. In [[King's Landing]], despite having proven herself a less than ideal ruler, [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen]] [[Cersei Lannister]] is determined to stay on the Iron Throne at any cost. Allying herself with [[Euron Greyjoy]] and [[Randyll Tarly]], Cersei's armies won several victories against the [[Last War|invading]] forces of Daenerys Targaryen, and have [[Sack of Highgarden|sacked]] the [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] stronghold of [[Highgarden]] in order to pay off the crown's debts to the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]]. Despite the larger threat to the realm, Cersei is content with allowing the army of the dead to devastate the North in order to rid her of her enemies before focusing on the threat herself. [[Tyrion Lannister]] tried once again to convince his sister to put aside her enmities and unite with Daenerys against the army of the dead, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Although she promised a military alliance with the dragon queen, Cersei instead brokered a backroom deal: with Euron's help and the financial backing of the Iron Bank, she hired the [[Golden Company]], the most powerful [[mercenary]] army in [[Essos]], to destroy all of her enemies at once and solidify [[House Lannister|Lannister]] rule over Westeros. For [[Jaime Lannister]], who has stood by his sister all their lives, this is the last straw; disgusted at Cersei's willingness to allow the realm to perish if it means that she can retain her crown, he abandoned her and is now heading north to honor the pledge he made to fight against the enemy facing them all.

From her base at [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], Daenerys and her Westerosi allies - armies from [[Dorne]], the [[Iron Islands]], and the [[Reach]] - attempted to retake the Iron Throne and restore her [[House Targaryen|family dynasty]]. Unfortunately, all of her plans went disastrously wrong: one of her key allies, [[Olenna Tyrell]], has been killed, having been given the mercy of a peaceful death after the Lannisters sacked Highgarden. [[Yara Greyjoy]], [[Ellaria Sand]], and [[Tyene Sand]] were taken [[hostage]] by [[Euron Greyjoy]], who single-handedly murdered [[Obara Sand]] and [[Nymeria Sand]] in a spectacular [[Assault on the Targaryen fleet|engagement]] by Euron's forces. Ellaria was tortured by Cersei Lannister in retaliation for the [[Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon|murder]] of Cersei's young daughter [[Myrcella Baratheon]], committed by Ellaria in revenge for the Lannister-backed [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|death]] of [[Prince]] [[Oberyn Martell]]. Cersei [[poison]]ed Tyene and forced a chained Ellaria to watch while her daughter died a slow death. Meanwhile, [[Yara Greyjoy]] remained the prisoner of her uncle Euron. Yara's younger brother, [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], rallied the few remaining [[Ironborn]] loyalists in an attempt to rescue her, after winning them over in a fight with [[Harrag]], Yara's last captain.

Frustrated by her losses, Daenerys decided to [[Battle of the Goldroad|ambush]] the combined Lannister and [[House Tarly|Tarly]] forces with her [[Dothraki]] horde and [[Drogon|one]] of her dragons. Although she succeeded in winning this battle, she recklessly burned the wagons of grain en route to the capital, which she needed to feed her own forces. After the battle, Daenerys gave the remaining Lannister and Tarly soldiers a choice: [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] to her and join in her goal to make "the world a better place than we found it" - or death. Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] and his son [[Dickon Tarly|Dickon]] chose death and stated their refusal to bend the knee to Daenerys, who they viewed as a "foreign invader". Daenerys accepted their choice and, having stated her refusal to put men in chains when Tyrion urged imprisonment instead, [[Execution|executed]] Randyll and Dickon Tarly via dragonfire. This alarmed Tyrion and [[Varys]], who remembered the actions of Daenerys's [[Aerys II Targaryen|father]] and discussed her decision to burn the Tarlys. Tyrion stated that Daenerys is not her father and never will be with the right counsel. Varys responds Tyrion must find a way to make her listen.

In the North, [[Jon Snow]], chosen as [[King in the North]] by his compatriots, sought out an alliance with Daenerys; not to help her seize the Iron Throne, but to aid him in the coming war against the army of the dead: the [[Great War]]. Through the combined efforts of Daenerys's remaining allies - as well as the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] - Jon [[Wight hunt|captured]] a [[Captured wight|wight]] and [[Dragonpit Summit|presented]] it before Cersei (who, up until then, thought they and the White Walkers were just stories) in order to prove their existence and return, though Daenerys lost Viserion in the process. During their alliance, Jon and Daenerys developed a romantic attraction and consummated their relationship. This may put their future operations in jeopardy, especially in light of their [[Rhaegar Targaryen|biological connection]] of which they are still unaware.

At [[Winterfell]], the North saw the return of two [[House Stark|Stark]] siblings who were believed to be dead - [[Arya Stark]], who [[Assassinations at the Twins|killed]] the remaining men of [[House Frey]] in revenge for the [[Red Wedding]], and [[Bran Stark]], who has now become the [[Three-Eyed Raven]]. Despite the schemes of [[Petyr Baelish]] to drive the Starks apart and seize power in his own bid to take the Iron Throne, Baelish was exposed as the true architect of the [[Assassination of Jon Arryn|deaths]] of [[Jon Arryn]] and [[Lysa Arryn]], and the War of the Five Kings, which saw the deaths of countless innocent people for a false cause. He was [[Trial of Petyr Baelish|executed]] for his crimes on the order of [[Sansa Stark]], bringing an end to his schemes once and for all.

Through his power of the [[Sight]], Bran previously discovered that his believed half-brother Jon Snow was, in fact, the son of [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and [[Lyanna Stark]]. However, this revelation was only part of the truth. When [[Samwell Tarly]] decided to leave his studies at the [[Citadel]] in [[Oldtown]] and go to [[Winterfell]] to return to Jon's side, Sam told Bran that Rhaegar had his [[marriage]] to [[Elia Martell]] annulled by the [[High Septon (Robert's Rebellion)|High Septon]] so he could marry Lyanna Stark. Bran confirmed their wedding via the Sight and discovered that Jon was born Aegon Targaryen, named by Lyanna. This means that not only is Jon legitimate but, as revealed by Bran, Jon is the true heir to the Targaryen dynasty, and an heir to the Iron Throne ahead of Daenerys herself, which may or may not have consequences for their newly formed alliance.

==Production==
===Pre-production===
For a time in January 2017, Season 8 renewal was put on indefinite hold, due to a disagreement between HBO and the showrunners over the number of episodes it would contain. While originally Benioff and Weiss stated they intended 7 episodes for Season 7 and 6 for Season 8, apparently there was some internal pushback that they should make more than six episodes (whether for story reasons or purely business/budget reasons is unclear).<ref>[http://tvline.com/2017/01/14/game-of-thrones-season-8-episode-count-premiere-date/ indeterminate hold]</ref> At their SXSW panel on March 12, 2017, Benioff and Weiss announced that Season 8 will consist of the originally planned six episodes. No new writers were introduced: [[Dave Hill]] wrote the first episode, [[Bryan Cogman]] the second episode, then Benioff and Weiss would divide up the remaining four. [[George R.R. Martin]] didn’t to script another episode.

On September 26, 2017, the directors for Season 8 were confirmed: the first five episodes were divided up between returning directors [[David Nutter]] and [[Miguel Sapochnik]]. [[Fabian Wagner]], Sapochnik's director of photography, confirmed he is working on episodes 3 and 5, leaving episodes 1, 2 and 4 for Nutter. David Benioff & D.B. Weiss would themselves direct the series finale, as they have worked as directors on several episodes in prior TV seasons.<ref>[http://ew.com/tv/2017/09/26/game-thrones-season-8-directors/ ]</ref><ref>http://watchersonthewall.com/miguel-sapochnik-directing-two-season-8-episodes-dp-fabian-wagner-confirms/</ref>
