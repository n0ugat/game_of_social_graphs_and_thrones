Lord '''Oscar Tully''' is the head of [[House Tully/House of the Dragon|House Tully]] and [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|Lord Paramount of the Riverlands]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
[[File:2x4 Oscar Tully Still.jpg|thumb|Oscar first meeting Daemon.|left]]
Oscar is a grandson of Lord [[Grover Tully]] and the heir to [[Riverrun]]. [[Grover Tully's son|His father]] died suddenly while still young, and Grover raised him in his stead.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Prince Daemon summons Grover Tully to [[Harrenhal]] and so Oscar goes in his place.  Simon then announces the arrival of [[Oscar Tully]], grandson of Lord [[Grover Tully]] and heir to [[Riverrun]]. Daemon learns that Lord Grover is still alive, but incapable of doing much more than laying in his bed, posing a problem for the [[Blacks]], as the situation prevents the armies of [[House Tully]] from being raised in their name. Daemon bluntly suggests that Oscar kill his grandfather, but the latter is appalled at the suggestion, explaining that Lord Grover raised him as if he was his son, and the act would amount to [[kinslaying]]. Daemon retorts that he can now understand the state of disarray that the [[Riverlands]] are in, and since [[House Bracken]] has declared for the Greens, he will instead seek the aid of [[House Blackwood]].<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 4: "[[The Red Dragon and the Gold]]" (2024).</ref>

[[Oscar Tully]], the new [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]], arrives with the Riverlords. He proclaims his intention to honor [[Grover Tully|his late grandfather]]'s oath of loyalty to Rhaenyra as [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]'s heir and offers [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] his allegiance. The Riverlords doubt young Oscar's leadership ability and despise Daemon for allowing the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]]' war atrocities against [[House Bracken]].<ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 7: "[[The Red Sowing]]" (2024).</ref>

[[File:House-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-7-13.jpg|thumb|Oscar orders Willems arrest.]]
To appease the other [[Lordship|lords]], Oscar condemns [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Willem Blackwood]]'s savagery, though Willem claims he was doing Daemon's bidding. Oscar dismisses Willem's excuse and declares he must be held accountable. Oscar demands that Daemon prove himself worthy of the Riverlords' banners by showing contrition for his earlier actions and dispensing justice. Daemon agrees and executes Willem.<ref name=":0" />
==Behind the scenes==
Oscar Tully's character description reads as follows:
:''"The young grandson of Grover Tully, heir to Riverrun and future Lord Paramount of the Riverlands."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Oscar Tully was Lord Grover Tully's great-grandson (not grandson), the second son of Elmo and younger brother of Kermit. He was red of hair, prideful, and determined to be a warrior. Kermit was said to be just a green boy, and Oscar was yet greener.{{Bookref|F&B|19}}

Oscar's biography is scant, in contrast to his father and his brother. The TV show condensed the characters of Elmo, Kermit, and Oscar Tully into just one character.<ref name="WBD" />

Oscar's name is a humorous reference to the ''Sesame Street'' character {{WPS|Oscar the Grouch}}, and so are the names (and personalities to a lesser extent) of his great-grandfather, his father, and his brother.
