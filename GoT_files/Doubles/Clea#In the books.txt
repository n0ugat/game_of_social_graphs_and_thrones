'''Clea''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] and a [[Slavery|slave]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Clea was a slave and at some point she was made a bedslave at a [[Pleasure house|brothel]] in the [[Long Bridge]] of [[Volantis]]. Like all bedslaves in Volantis, she was branded with a slave tattoo shaped like a tear on her cheek. She speaks the [[Common Tongue]].{{Ref|GOT503}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] approaches her at a brothel and they take an interest in each other. Although he has no money, she offers to have sex with him. Tyrion, however, finds himself unable to perform,{{Ref|GOT503}} thinking of [[Shae]].{{Cite}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character by the name of Clea.

Tyrion does encounter a Westerosi-looking prostitute in [[Selhorys]], a town under Volantene rule while searching for [[Tysha]]. Her real name is unknown; the propertier refers to her as "sunset girl". Contrary to the scene depicted in the TV series, however, Tyrion does not befriend her but does have sex with her, noticing that she just lies there, unmoving. Her back is severely scarred and her eyes look dead, indicating she was forced to become a prostitute. Too drunk to care, Tyrion retches on the carpet and has sex with her again, then leaving ashamed with himself.{{Bookref|ADWD|22}}
