'''Martyn Lannister''', along with his brother [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], was a [[squire]] in the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army. Both are younger sons of [[Kevan Lannister]], and younger brothers of Ser [[Lancel Lannister]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Martyn and his brother [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] are captured by the forces of [[House Tully]] led by [[Edmure Tully]] following the [[Battle of the Fords]]. He is taken [[hostage]] and placed in a cell at [[Riverrun]], the seat of the Tullys.{{Ref|GOT303}}

After [[Robb Stark|Robb]] visits Riverrun to attend the funeral of [[Hoster Tully|his grandfather]], Martyn and Willem are visited in their cell by [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]], who tends to Martyn's wounded hand while Willem looks on in silence. Martyn asks if it's true that Robb can turn into a wolf at night and devour the flesh of his enemies. Earlier, Robb criticized Edmure Tully for the Battle of the Stone Mill and concludes that Willem and Martyn are not valuable enough to exchange for [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] or [[Arya Stark|Arya]] Stark.{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:Martyn and Willem Lannister dead s3e5.jpg|thumb|The bodies of Martyn and Willem are presented to Robb.]]
Martyn and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] are murdered inside their cells by [[Rickard Karstark]] as vengeance for [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]'s killing of his son [[Torrhen Karstark|Torrhen]]. Their bodies are presented to Robb. Rickard defends his actions as them being kin to Jaime, but Robb furiously condemns this as saying they were innocent boys.{{Ref|GOT305}}
