Lady Mallister and three other riverlords arrive at [[Harrenhal]] to complain to [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] about the [[Raids on Bracken lands|atrocities]] performed by the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]] at the [[House Bracken|Brackens]]' lands. She firmly states that they shall not fight for a tyrant.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

At a meeting in the castle's [[godswood]], Lady Mallister agrees with her new Lord Paramount [[Oscar Tully]]'s decision to honor the oath of his grandsire to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], but also points out that the old ways of their people demand justice for the recent crimes of House Blackwood.{{Ref|HOTD207}}
