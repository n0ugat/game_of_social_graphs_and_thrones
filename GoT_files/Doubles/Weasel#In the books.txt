'''Weasel''' is a servant of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Weasel aids the [[Tickler]] in the interrogation and torture of prisoners in [[Harrenhal]]. While the Tickler asks questions, Weasel straps the victim, and then places a wooden bucket with a rat inside over the victim's bare chest. At the Tickler's command, Weasel begins to heat the bucket with a torch to make the rat claw its way out through the victim's chest.{{Ref|GOT204}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Weese is the understeward of the Wailing Tower in Harrenhal and a servant of [[House Whent]] that later submits to [[House Lannister]]. He is a cruel and abusive man, resorting to violence at the slightest provocation, even just for staring at him. He treats [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and other servants very brutally. He, not [[Amory Lorch]], is the second man whom Arya tells [[Jaqen H'ghar]] to kill, because he was mean to her.

"Weasel" is a different character, a little girl about two years old whose real name is unknown. She and a woman whose right hand was cut off, perhaps her mother, were found by [[Yoren]] on the march north from [[King's Landing]]. The one-armed woman died shortly afterwards, leaving the girl in the custody of the caravan. When [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] and his men caught Arya, [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], [[Hot Pie]], and [[Lommy]], Weasel managed to escape, and has not been seen since then. Arya takes her name as an alias while at the castle. For the TV series, the young girl Weasel has been removed and the name given to Weese.
