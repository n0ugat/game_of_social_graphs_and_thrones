{{Quote|But wars cost money and Aegor Rivers, the leader of the Blackfyre forces who now called himself "Bittersteel", decided he could sell his army's services to other lords while waiting to return to Westeros. The Golden Company was born. For their words they chose "Beneath the gold, the bitter steel" to remind themselves that they weren't just hired killers, but knights of Westeros who would one day retake their home.|[[Jorah Mormont]]|The Golden Company}}
'''Aegor Rivers''', also known as '''Bittersteel''', is one of the infamous [[Great Bastards]] of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], also known as "Aegon the Unworthy." He is the founder of the [[Golden Company]], a [[Mercenary|sellsword company]] in [[Essos]] composed primarily of [[Westeros]]i exiles.

==Biography==
===Background===
Aegor Rivers was born of [[bastard]]y to King Aegon the Unworthy, being considered one of the "Great Bastards." When [[Daemon Blackfyre]], his brother, rose in [[Blackfyre Rebellion|rebellion]] against the [[Iron Throne]], Aegor supported the [[House Blackfyre|rebels]]. When the Blackfyres lost the war with the death of the pretender king Daemon on the battlefield, Aegor fled into Essos with the remaining Blackfyre forces.{{Ref|H&L705}}

Aegor, now calling himself "Bittersteel" and fashioning for himself a personal sigil (a red horse with black wings breathing fire on a golden field), founded the Golden Company to fund another war against the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]. The sellsword company, to remind themselves that they are not just sellswords but [[Knighthood|knights]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] who will one day retake their home, chose "Beneath the gold, the bitter steel!" for their battle cry.{{Ref|H&L705}}

Aegor, along with his siblings is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.{{Ref|GOT104}}

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aegor Rivers was often called "Bittersteel". While King Aegon IV had many bastard children, the mothers of four of them were also noblewomen, which encouraged him to formally acknowledge them. The four Great Bastards were [[Daemon Blackfyre]] (whose mother, secretly, was [[Daena Targaryen]]), Aegor "Bittersteel" Rivers (whose mother was a member of [[House Bracken]]), [[Brynden Rivers|Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers]] (whose mother was a member of [[House Blackwood]]), and [[Shiera Seastar]] (whose mother was Serenei of [[Lys]], from an ancient Valyrian noble family).

On his deathbed, Aegon IV, perhaps spitefully, had them all [[Legitimization|legitimized]], which led to strife between them and his legitimate heir King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]], tensions which ultimately split the realm apart in the devastating civil war known as the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].

Bittersteel sided with his half-brother Daemon Blackfyre, while his other half-brother Bloodraven sided with their half-brother King Daeron II Targaryen. Bittersteel and Bloodraven hated each other, because they both competed for the love of their half-sister Shiera Seastar. Bloodraven asked her to marry him dozens of times and she refused, but she did let him into her bed - though she had many lovers. Shiera, however, completely rejected Bittersteel, and for this he never forgave Bloodraven. It also didn't help that Bittersteel's mother was a Bracken and Bloodraven's mother was a Blackwood, as those two noble families had been feuding for thousands of years. Bittersteel became a great champion and general for the Blackfyres, while Bloodraven became a great champion and general for the Targaryens.

The Blackfyre Rebellion ended with the [[Battle of Redgrass Field|Battle of the Redgrass Field]], in which Daemon Blackfyre and his eldest two sons were slain. Bittersteel survived, and became one of the major leaders of the surviving Blackfyre forces as they fled into exile in the [[Free Cities]]. Daemon left behind five sons and multiple daughters, so Bittersteel became their guardian, secreting them across the [[Narrow Sea]] with his dwindling followers.

While in the Free Cities, many of Bittersteel's remaining men deserted to join [[Mercenary|mercenary companies]]. In response, Bittersteel resorted to forming his remaining soldiers into their ''own'' mercenary company, called the [[Golden Company]]. Day by day and year by year they fought in the petty wars between the different Free Cities in order to make enough money for their basic upkeep. This step at least ensured that the Blackfyre Pretenders would have some semblance of a stable core fighting force whenever they mounted a new plot to invade Westeros. In time, the Golden Company became the largest and most skilled mercenary company in the Free Cities.
