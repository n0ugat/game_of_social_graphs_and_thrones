{{Quote|Sell your oysters somewhere else.|Brusco to "[[Arya Stark|Lanna]]"|The Dance of Dragons (episode)}}
'''Brusco''' is a bouncer living in [[Braavos]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
When "[[Arya Stark|Lanna]]" enters the brothel to sell oysters, Brusco tells her to leave, but [[Lhara]] convinces him to let her stay.{{Ref|GOT509}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels Brusco is a fishmonger, and doesn't work at a brothel. The Kindly Man describes him as "a good man with a bad back". [[Brea]] (who appears as a prostitute in the show) is his eldest daughter in the novels. He has one more daughter named Talea, and at least two sons. He is sparing with his words and his coin.

Some time after Arya arrives at the House of Black and White, the Kindly Man orders her to work for Brusco, as a part of her apprentice. Arya does well selling his merchandise (oysters, clams, crabs, mussels, cockles, sometimes prawns). During her work she befriends many people, learns the Braavosi tongue and hears many secrets. After she kills [[Dareon]], she brings Brusco his purse and boots. Brusco does not ask her where she got those.

During the period that Arya is blind, she misses Brusco and his daughters a lot. After she is given her eyesight back, she returns to work for Brusco, as if she had never been away.

In Arya's sample chapter ("Mercy") of the sixth book, it is revealed Brusco is one of the actors at [[Izembaro]]'s theatre. He plays the role of the boar in the play ''[[The Bloody Hand]]''.
