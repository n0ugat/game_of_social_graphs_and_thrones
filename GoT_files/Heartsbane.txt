{{Quote|See that sword? It's called Heartsbane. It's been in our family for 500 years. It's Valyrian steel. Only a handful of them left in the world. It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die. To him. He will ''never'' wield that sword.|[[Randyll Tarly]] to [[Gilly]], referring to [[Samwell Tarly]]|Blood of My Blood}}
'''Heartsbane'''{{Ref|GOT606}} is the ancestral [[Valyrian steel]] sword of [[House Tarly]]. The Tarlys have held the blade for some 500 years, and it is usually displayed proudly on a mantle in an antler sword stand at their seat at [[Horn Hill]].<ref>"[[Valyrian Steel (short)|Valyrian Steel]]"</ref>

The hilt is wrought in the shape of a bow and arrow, with the pommel fashioned as arrow fletching, and the crossguard forming the limbs of the bow. This reflects the sigil of House Tarly - the huntsman.

The scabbard appears to have been carved from wood with a large gnarl in the center. The wood itself is largely left uncovered and undecorated, leaving a unique pattern that evokes a matching theme of the forest, the huntsman's domain.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Heartsbane hilt, close-up.jpg|thumb|170x170px|Close-up of Heartsbane's hilt while sheathed.]]
During the reign of [[Aenys Targaryen]], [[Samwell Tarly (lord)|"Savage Sam" Tarly]] was the head of [[House Tarly]]. When the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] [[Vulture King]] rebelled against King Aenys, Sam led the royalist forces in the [[Vulture Hunt]] to defeat him. He wielded Heartsbane, which was said to run red from point to hilt with rebel blood.<ref>"[[House Tarly (short)|House Tarly]]"</ref>

Two centuries later during [[Robert's Rebellion]], Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] led the vanguard of [[House Tyrell]], Tarly men-at-arms among them, as part of the royalist forces. With Heartsbane in hand, Randyll won the [[Battle of Ashford]] against the forces of [[Robert Baratheon]], the future king's only military defeat.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:606 Heartsbane.png|thumb|176x176px|Heartsbane above the hearth at Horn Hill.]]
While dining with his banished son [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]], Randyll discovers that his partner [[Gilly]] is a wildling. Furious, Randyll points out Heartsbane, briefly explaining its history and stating that it will never go to Samwell.

Later that night, Samwell steals Heartsbane as he leaves Horn Hill with Gilly and her [[Sam|baby]], intending to use the sword in his studies about Valyrian steel in the Citadel.<ref>"[[Blood of My Blood]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Samwell, feeling guilty, tells [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and [[Jorah Mormont]] that he "borrowed" Heartsbane.<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref> Samwell later gives his family's ancestral sword to Jorah (due to its Valyrian properties allowing it to kill [[White Walkers]]), who promises to wield it for the [[Battle of Winterfell]] to honor of his late father, [[Jeor Mormont]], who Sam also saw as father figure. Towards the end of the Great Battle, Jorah fends off many [[wight]]s in order to protect Daenerys, getting stabbed multiple times in the process and eventually succumbing to his wounds.<ref>"[[The Long Night]]"</ref> 

The current whereabouts of Heartsbane are unknown.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Heartsbane has been in the possession of House Tarly for five hundred years. Like [[Ice]], it is a two-handed greatsword. It is currently wielded by [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Randyll Tarly]] and, like the [[Horn Hill|lands]] and titles of House Tarly, will pass to [[Dickon Tarly]] after Randyll passes away.

At the Battle of Ashford during Robert's Rebellion, Randyll cut down Lord Cafferen (a former royalist who had defected to Robert after his defeat at the [[Battle of Summerhall]]) wielding Heartsbane. After the battle, according to [[Stannis Baratheon]], Randyll also used Heartsbane to behead Caffren's corpse, sending the severed head to King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]] as a token of loyalty.
