The '''Vulture Hunt'''{{Ref|H&L616}} was the crackdown of the [[Vulture King]], a [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] rebel who defied the authority of the [[Iron Throne]]  in the [[Dornish Marches]]. Lord [[Samwell Tarly (lord)|Samwell "Savage Sam" Tarly]] played a key role in putting down the rebellion.<ref>"[[House Tarly (short)|House Tarly]]"</ref>

==In the books==
The books elaborate the scope of the rebellion and identity of the key combatants. The Vulture King was mainly able to rebel because [[House Martell]], itself in defiance of the Iron Throne, largely ignored the insurrection. [[Orys Baratheon]] - the former [[Hand of the King]] to Aegon the Conqueror and a veteran of the [[First Dornish War]] - led the houses of the Dornish Marches in the crackdown of the rebellion, and was mortally wounded in a duel with one of the rebels.<ref>''The World of Ice and Fire'', Andals in the Stormlands</ref>
