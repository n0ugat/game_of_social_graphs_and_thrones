'''Castle Driftmark''',{{Guideref|Driftmark}} also known simply as '''Driftmark''',{{Guideref|Driftmark}} is a castle on the eponymous island of [[Driftmark]]. It once served as the seat of [[House Velaryon]], but has since been replaced by [[High Tide]], which lies on the opposite side of the island.{{Guideref|Driftmark}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Castle Driftmark is said to have been grim and damp, often flooded. During the golden age of [[Corlys Velaryon]]'s reign over Driftmark, three fishing villages near the castle combined to form the port-town of [[Hull]]. Eventually, Corlys commissioned the construction of High Tide and moved the [[Driftwood Throne]] and his family there, leaving Castle Driftmark behind.
