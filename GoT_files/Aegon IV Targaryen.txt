'''Aegon IV Targaryen''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Āegon IV Targārien''}} also called '''Aegon the Unworthy''', was the eleventh [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] to rule the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He was known for his endless gluttony, and even better known for [[Legitimization|legitimizing]] all of his [[bastard]]s on his deathbed, eventually leading to the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aegon IV is remembered as one of the worst Targaryen kings in the entire history of the Targaryen dynasty, which is the reason why he is popularly known as "Aegon the Unworthy." Aegon was a decadent, gluttonous, and corrupt ruler, who indulged his passions and whims at every opportunity. During his reign, he wore a huge and heavy red gold crown, whose points are dragon heads with gemstone eyes.

Being handsome and attractive in his youth, Aegon had an incredible wit as a young prince and is popular with women, both highborn and lowborn. He had as many as nine mistresses and many bastards. Supposedly, he had any woman he wanted, whether they were married or not. However, the only woman he doesn't love is Naerys Targaryen, his sister-wife, as she was gentle, pious, and frail, which was what Aegon hates. People often joked that while the Targaryen words were "Fire and Blood," Aegon IV's motto might as well have been "Wash her and bring her to my bed." 

Due to his years of overindulgence, by the end of his reign, Aegon IV was extremely obese, to the point that his legs could barely support his own weight. Even so, he remained quite vain throughout his life. Moreover, he was a very petty man, needlessly causing strife at the royal court and in his own family, including his own true-born son Daeron. Four of King Aegon's bastard children were born to noblewomen, and they became known as the "[[Great Bastards]]." Chief among them was Daemon Blackfyre, who, upon being legitimized, created [[House Blackfyre]]. Other notable bastards were Aegor Rivers ("Bittersteel"), Brynden Rivers ("Bloodraven"), and Shiera Seastar. Aegon IV foolishly [[Legitimization|legitimized]] all of his bastard children upon his deathbed, which resulted in Daemon Blackfyre, rumored to be Aegon's favorite child despite being a bastard, declaring himself the rightful heir and tearing apart the Seven Kingdoms in a civil war. Ultimately, Aegon IV's corruption led to a series of [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]s, which would plague Westeros for five generations.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', Robb tells Catelyn he decided to legitimize Jon and name him as his successor. Catelyn, resentful toward Jon as ever, bitterly responds "Aegon the Fourth legitimized all his bastards on his deathbed. And how much pain, grief, war, and murder grew from that?" Robb, fully trusting Jon, dismisses his mother's objection and issues a royal decree according to his decision.{{Bookref|ASOS|45}} 

According to author [[George R.R. Martin]], Aegon IV is loosely the Targaryen equivalent of King [[wikipedia:Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII of England]].<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Targaryen_Kings So Spake Martin, November 1, 2005]</ref> Martin's instructions for artistic depictions of Aegon IV explicitly cite Henry VIII. Both kings started out young and attractive, but by the ends of their reigns became infamously fat from overindulgence. Moreover, they had numerous sexual affairs, which resulted in bloody succession conflicts, which were eventually resolved with the rise of good rulers (Daeron II and Elizabeth I respectively).
