{{Quote|She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of you traitors call her "Mhysa", she will never be your mother.|The Son of the Harpy to [[Mossador]] about [[Daenerys Targaryen]].|The House of Black and White}}
This unnamed man was a '''Son of the Harpy'''.

==Biography==
===Background===
He is a member of the [[Sons of the Harpy]].{{Ref|GOT502}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
When [[Daario Naharis]] and [[Grey Worm]] search the Son's house in [[Meereen]], they initially find nothing. Grey Worm was quick to assume they hit a dead end yet Daario tells that [[Unsullied]] who had forgotten how to fear fail to comprehend when someone's in hiding, before stabbing the wall behind him, causing the Son of the Harpy to fall out. With his leg injured, the Son is subsequently arrested. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] consults her advisors and [[Mossador]] urges her to kill him to send a message to the Sons of the Harpy. Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] advises her to exercise caution, suggesting that he might have valuable information; Daario insists the Son doesn't, as he had already questioned him, and suggests giving him a fair trial as a way of maintaining the equality among the citizens, to which Daenerys agrees. Before the trial can take place, Mossador enters the Son's cell; the Son contemptuously declares Daenerys an outsider, who would never be mother to the slaves, no matter how many times they call her "Mhysa". Mossador murders him and dumps his corpse in public, his face covered by his harpy mask and writes "kill the masters" on a wall in his blood. He is executed as punishment for this.{{Ref|GOT502}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no parallel to this character. The Brazen Beasts (an army of watchmen formed by Daenerys) have taken dozens of the Harpy’s Sons, and those who have survived their capture have yielded names when questioned sharply, but the identity of their leader remains unknown.
