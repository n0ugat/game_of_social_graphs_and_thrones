{{Quote|My little birds are everywhere.|Varys|Lord Snow}}
'''Little birds'''{{Ref|GOT103}} are the members of a network of spies and informants in the service of [[Varys]], the [[Master of Whisperers]] on the [[Small Council]] of the [[Red Keep]]. Many of Varys's "little birds" are seemingly innocuous street children, although adults are counted among their ranks as well, notably [[Jorah Mormont]].

Apparently Varys informally refers to his spies as "my little birds" due to the common euphemism for spying, that "a little bird told me".

Varys's network spans not only the length and breadth of [[Westeros]], but also [[Essos]] as far east as [[Vaes Dothrak]] and [[Slaver's Bay]] and possibly even [[Qarth]].

After Varys flees from [[King's Landing]], some of his little birds in the city are recruited and used by [[Qyburn]], the new Master of Whisperers under [[Cersei Lannister]].

==Known members==
Tyrion tells Cersei that Varys has "thousands of spies in his employ".<ref name="S2E08" />

*[[Little bird (You Win or You Die)]] - seen in [[Vaes Dothrak]]
*[[Little bird (The Mountain and the Viper)]] - seen in [[Meereen]]
*[[Arthur]] - seen in [[King's Landing]]
*[[Frances]] - seen in King's Landing
*Ser {[[Jorah Mormont]]} - spied on [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to earn a royal pardon from King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]. He eventually became devoted to Daenerys and stopped disclosing information to Varys. Died in the [[Battle of Winterfell]] whilst protecting Daenerys.
*{[[Ros]]} - spied on [[Petyr Baelish]]. Once Littlefinger found out about this, he handed her over to [[Joffrey Baratheon]], who brutally killed her with his crossbow.
*[[Martha]] - worked for Varys shortly before his [[execution]], and apparently attempted to [[poison]] Daenerys.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Varys informs [[Catelyn Stark]] that he has "little birds" all over the continent, even in the [[North]]. He is already aware of the [[Valyrian steel]] dagger that was used in the attempt on [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s life, and knew that Catelyn and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] were coming to [[King's Landing]].<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref>

While walking in the [[Red Keep]]'s gardens, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] identifies several of Varys's "little birds" to [[Eddard Stark]], most notably several children.<ref>"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref>

A [[Little bird (You Win or You Die)|young boy]] reaches Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] at the market at [[Vaes Dothrak]], gives him a letter of pardon from King [[Robert Baratheon]] for his reports on the movements of [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]], and informs him he can go home. The letter clues Ser Jorah that an assassination attempt against Daenerys is imminent.<ref>"[[You Win or You Die]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Tyrion and Cersei discuss how the information Varys learns from his spy network makes him dangerous. Varys tells Tyrion "I heard a song, all the way from Qarth, beyond the [[Red Waste]]": Daenerys Targaryen still lives and has hatched three [[dragon]]s.<ref name="S2E08">"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"</ref>

Varys, aware that [[Petyr Baelish]] has mistreated [[Ros]] since she came into his service, offers Ros a chance to work for him as a spy.<ref>"[[Valar Morghulis]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Ros continues to act as one of Varys's little birds, informing him of Littlefinger's plan of taking [[Sansa Stark]] with him to the [[Eyrie]].<ref>"[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"</ref> Ros's arrangement is eventually discovered by Littlefinger, who then sells Ros to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] for target practice before Varys can protect her.<ref>"[[The Climb]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
In a meeting of the [[Small Council]], Varys informs [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] that Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen has come to power in [[Meereen]] and is growing stronger, with three [[dragon]]s, two experienced knights at her side, and a powerful army behind her. While Cersei merely brushes these off, a more concerned Tywin decides to deal with her. He questions Varys as to whether or not his little birds can find their way into Meereen and Varys assures him that they can. <ref>"[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]"</ref>

Later, [[Little bird (The Mountain and the Viper)|a young boy]] approaches Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] in Meereen and presents him with a letter. Barristan reads the letter and discovers that Ser Jorah Mormont was reporting Daenerys's activities to Varys.<ref>"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Many weeks after losing [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] in [[Volantis]], Varys presents himself to the Imp in [[Meereen]]. He explains that his little birds sing in the east as well as the west, and he was thus aware that Tyrion had reached the city and become Daenerys's new advisor, exactly as Varys had intended. The Spider then implies that he will put his little birds to use helping Tyrion enforce the Queen's peace in Meereen.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
While investigating the [[Sons of the Harpy]] with Tyrion, Varys determines that the Sons must have a leader and confirms that his little birds are already aflutter.<ref>"[[The Red Woman]]"</ref>

Varys's little birds eventually enable him to locate [[Vala]], the prostitute who has been helping the Sons of the Harpy prey upon the [[Unsullied]]. After dealing with her, Tyrion asks Varys if his little birds can infiltrate [[Yunkai]], [[Astapor]], and Volantis, the three cities now arrayed against Meereen. Varys assures him that they can.

Back in King's Landing, [[Qyburn]], the new Master of Whisperers, is busy co-opting Varys's little birds (at least those in the capital) for himself. Like Varys, he is kind to the children, asks after their families and gives them sweets, simply asking for whispers in exchange.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref> One of the little birds lures [[Lancel Lannister]] below the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] and slices his tendons in order to prevent him from stopping the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]]. Later, Qyburn orders them to kill [[Pycelle]].

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]] ===
Varys employs a northern girl [[Martha]] as one of his new little birds. She reports that Daenerys is not eating and is afraid of the guards. Varys comforts her and says that they will try to poison Daenerys again later.<ref>"[[The Bells]]"</ref>

With Varys's treason and execution, the little birds are most likely disbanded.

==In the books==

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, at least some of Varys's "little birds" have had their tongues cut out. Though Varys himself did not cut them out, they are provided to him already mutilated by [[Illyrio Mopatis]]. They are mostly children, which allows them to move through the secret passages of the [[Red Keep]]. After [[Qyburn]]'s appointment to Varys's position on the Small Council, the failed maester boasts that he has easily taken over Varys's network, since most of the little birds are eager to be rewarded for their information, regardless of who the Master of Whisperers actually is. Nonetheless, Varys himself remains at large, and it is not clear how much of Varys's network Qyburn has actually managed to turn.

Prior to relocating to King's Landing, Varys had a network of "little mice", small and quick orphan boys and girls whom he taught to climb through walls and chimneys, as well as how to read, in order to steal secret information recorded in letters and ledgers, and sell them to the highest bidder.
