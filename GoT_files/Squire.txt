A '''squire'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is traditionally a young man that enters the service of a [[Knighthood|knight]] or [[Lordship|lord]] usually with the promise of attaining knighthood at some point in the future, when the squire's master deems it proper. Squires usually take the role of a personal servant, running errands for their masters and keeping their armor, shield, weaponry, and horse ready for battle or [[tournament]]s.

Men who haven't the money to buy armaments or the ambition to become a knight stay squires, and become [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]].

Squires frequently fight by their master's side in battle, though very young squires do not normally participate in combat.

Even a knight can serve as a squire for another man, normally a lord. Ser [[Daemon Sand]] squired for [[Oberyn Martell]] during the [[trial by combat]] in [[King's Landing]].
