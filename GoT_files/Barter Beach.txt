'''Barter Beach'''{{Ref|H&L603}} is a major pirate den in the [[Basilisk Isles]], off the north coast of [[Sothoryos]].

==In the books==
Barter Beach is specifically stated to be located on Talon island. All other pirate towns in the Basilisk Isles are by transient and mobile: for example, [[Port Plunder]] gets destroyed once every generation by fleets from the Free Cities on anti-pirate campaigns, but within a year a new settlement will be built and named "Port Plunder" to replace it - often not even on the same island in the chain. From its description, however, Barter Beach is literally a shoreline on Talon island. It is possible this means that it is not so much a town or settlement as a large beach with good anchorage where pirate ships can be brought aground to unload their wares and trade.
