'''Nymeria's daughter''' was the first child of the warrior-queen [[Nymeria]] and her first husband, [[Mors Martell]].

==Biography==
She was the first child of the warrior-queen [[Nymeria]] and her first husband, [[Mors Martell]]. At some point, her father was killed in battle either before or during the time that her mother was dealing with the rebels from [[House Dayne]]. Eventually, Nymeria defeated them and sent [[Vorian Dayne]] to the [[Wall]], taking his son, [[Davos Dayne]], as her husband, giving her daughter a stepfather. Despite having a half-brother by Davos, this Martell ultimately succeeded her mother, as Nymeria had proved in [[Nymeria's War|her war]] that women were at least equal to men, if not better.{{Ref|H&L509}}

==In the books==
Since she was the eldest child, she inherited the rule of [[Dorne]] even though she was a woman, as per [[Rhoynar|Rhoynish]] custom.
