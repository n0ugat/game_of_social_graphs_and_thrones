==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Hornwood effectively goes extinct during the War of the Five Kings, with the death of its lord, Halys Hornwood, at the [[battle on the Green Fork]], and the death of his son and heir Daryn in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood|battle in the Whispering Wood]]. 

Lordship of Hornwood is then inherited by Halys's wife, Donella Hornwood (née [[House Manderly|Manderly]]), who is forced to marry [[Ramsay Bolton]], then starved to death, allowing Ramsay to take possession of Hornwood. Surviving Hornwoods after this include Halys's sister, Berena Hornwood, married into [[House Tallhart]], who is held captive by the [[ironborn]] at [[Torrhen's Square]], and Halys's bastard son Larence Snow.
