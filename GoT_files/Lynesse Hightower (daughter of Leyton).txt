==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
When [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] asks [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] the reason he had sold poachers into [[slavery]], he mentions Lynesse and her expensive tastes, which he always sought to please, leading to his ruin. Then Daenerys asks where is she now and he answers that she's in another place with [[Tregar Ormollen|another man]].{{Ref|GOT104}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lynesse is described as extremely beautiful with blonde hair and pale skin. Jorah Mormont says she looked a bit like Daenerys Targaryen.

Lynesse married Jorah after he won a tournament to celebrate the victory of King Robert against the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], in which Jorah wore her favor.

Lynesse was used to the riches and luxury of Oldtown, and found Bear Island primitive and crude. Jorah once brought her to Winterfell, and [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] noticed how unhappy she looked. She confessed to Catelyn that the North was no place for a Hightower of Oldtown. Catelyn tried to console Lynesse by telling her "there was a Tully of Riverrun who felt the same once, but in time she found much here she could love", but in vain. 

Jorah's attempts to please his wife led to him spending all of his money. He disgraced himself through behavior unbefitting a lord, by arresting poachers and selling them to slavers (slavery has been illegal in the Seven Kingdoms for millennia). When [[Eddard Stark]] came to arrest Jorah, he and Lynesse fled across the [[Narrow Sea]] to the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Lys]], leaving his aunt [[Maege Mormont|Maege]] to become the ruling Lady of Bear Island.

Jorah attempted to make his living as a sellsword, but was unable to provide an income acceptable to Lynesse. Eventually she left him and became a concubine to the merchant-lord [[Tregar Ormollen]]. Despite only being a concubine, however- even his lawful wife fears her power.

The other Mormonts have a very negative opinion about Lynesse; [[Jeor Mormont|Jeor]] tells Jon that she was vain and, without her, Jorah would have never thought of selling poachers; Maege and Dacey regard Lynesse scornfully, as a weak woman whose soft hands were never made for axes- nor did she give Jorah children.

She's described as Humfrey's 'whore of a sister', in 'A Feast for Crows'.
