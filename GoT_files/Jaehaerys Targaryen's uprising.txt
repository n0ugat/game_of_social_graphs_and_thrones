In the late reign of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Maegor Targaryen]], his nephew [[Prince]] [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] was declared the rightful king by [[House Baratheon]]. More than half of [[Westeros]] participated in this '''uprising'''.<ref name="Maegor">"[[Maegor the Cruel (short)|Maegor the Cruel]]"</ref>

==History==
===Prelude===
After the death of King [[Aenys Targaryen]], Prince Maegor returned from [[exile]] and demanded the [[Iron Throne]]. Some time later during the [[Faith Militant uprising]], his nephew [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon]], [[Prince of Dragonstone]], raised an army of [[Westerlands|westermen]] and marched on [[King's Landing]]. Before Prince Aegon could get there in time, Maegor ordered his bannermen to attack the rebel prince's host from all sides while he mounted [[Balerion|Balerion the Black Dread]]. Maegor's army [[Battle Beneath the Gods Eye|met]] Aegon's beneath the [[Gods Eye]], easily defeating the significantly larger host by killing Aegon and his dragon [[Quicksilver]], crippling the army's morale. Thus ended the uprising for the rightful heir. His siblings, however, Jaehaerys included, still remained.<ref name="Maegor"/>

===Uprising===
In the final days of Maegor's reign, House Baratheon declared Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen the rightful king, and Houses Lannister, Tyrell, and Arryn soon followed. The [[lord admiral]], [[Daemon Velaryon]], gave the [[royal fleet]] to Prince Jaehaerys. Meanwhile in King's Landing [[King|Queen]] [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena Targaryen]], one of Maegor's Black Brides, stow away from the Red Keep on her dragon [[Dreamfyre]], while [[Grand Maester]] [[Benifer]] fled the capital. Jaehaerys' rebellion was short-lived, as Maegor was found dead on the Iron Throne with his wrists cut and one of the swords pointing through his neck.<ref name="Maegor"/>

===Aftermath===
After the uprising, Prince Jaehaerys was crowned King Jaehaerys I. He made several reconciliations with enemies made by Maegor and Aenys, quickly earning the name "Jaehaerys the Conciliator".

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', this uprising is the same.
