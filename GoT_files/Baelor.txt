==Synopsis==
=== In the Riverlands ===
[[File:Theon and Robb 1x09.jpg|thumb|[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Robb Stark|Robb]] outside the [[Twins]].]]Robb's army has reached the [[Twins]], the heavily fortified crossing over the [[Green Fork]] of [[Trident]]. [[Theon Greyjoy]] shoots down messenger ravens, so no word of their presence can be relayed, but finds nothing more but messages to extended family members. To enter the castle would be perilous for Robb, so Catelyn Stark enters to negotiate their crossing the river. 

Though held by [[House Frey]], bannermen to [[Catelyn Stark]]'s [[Hoster Tully|father]], Lord [[Walder Frey]] has not yet taken up arms. When called up, he says he had been preparing to march, and was just waiting for all his forces to arrive. In reality, he waited to see which side was winning before deciding whether to get involved. Now, as the Tully's army has been defeated and [[Riverrun]] is held by the Lannisters, he wants to know why he should be helping Robb and taking up arms against the king. After some hard bargaining between Catelyn and Walder, they strike a deal: the Freys will join Robb's cause, allow him to cross and commit troops to his army, but in return both Robb and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] must each marry one of Walder's own children. Robb agrees, though noting that Arya won't like it. Robb must also take [[Olyvar Frey]] as a squire.

The [[House Lannister|Lannister]] armies prepare for battle. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] tells his son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that he means to use the [[Hill tribes|hill tribe]] forces to give them an edge against the [[House Stark|Stark]] army, essentially to be used as cannon fodder. He orders Tyrion to lead them from the front of the vanguard. Tyrion angrily accuses his father of trying to kill him. He storms back to his tent to find that [[Bronn]] has found him, as per instruction, a [[Prostitution|whore]] named [[Shae]]. Tyrion takes an immediate liking to her. When told they go into battle in the vanguard in the morning, Bronn goes off to find a whore for himself.

Tyrion, Bronn, and Shae play a drinking game the night before the battle. Tyrion makes observations and if he is correct the person has to drink. He guesses correctly that Bronn has been beyond the Wall and killed someone before he was twelve years old (though it was a woman, not a man, and he killed her in self-defense, because she was coming at him with an axe). Tyrion guesses that Shae's mother was a whore, her father deserted them, and she is low born; however he is wrong on each guess. Tyrion cannot read Shae's personality, but this only makes her more intriguing to him. When Shae starts to question Tyrion, [[Bronn]] reveals that he heard Tyrion was once married. Reluctantly, Tyrion explains that when he was very young, he and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] were out riding near [[Casterly Rock]] and found a young common girl in distress from bandits. While Jaime chased the bandits off, Tyrion comforted the girl, whose name was [[Tysha]]. They ended up getting drunk at a local inn, and she became so enamored of him that Tyrion felt like he wasn't an ugly dwarf. Later that night she had sex with Tyrion, the first time he was ever with a woman. Tyrion fell madly in love, and bribed a drunken septon to marry them in secret.

However, two weeks later his father, Tywin, found out, and was utterly furious that his son had married a commoner. Tywin forced Jaime to reveal the truth: the girl was a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. Jaime set the situation up to do something nice for his little brother. Tywin then instructed his guards to have sex with her, with her being paid a silver coin for each man, while Tyrion was forced to watch. Shae points out that Tyrion was foolish to believe a woman would sleep with him just hours after almost being raped. As she gets romantic with Tyrion, Bronn leaves the tent.[[File:Tyrion 1x09.jpg|right|190px|thumb|[[Tyrion Lannister]] leads the [[hill tribes]] into battle.]]The next morning, the Lannister army finds that the Starks have stolen a march on them; they are about to be attacked and have to hastily prepare for battle. Tyrion gives a rousing speech to his hill tribesmen, but as they charge for the front, he is first knocked out by an accidental blow to the head from someone's war hammer and then nearly trampled. When he regains consciousness on the back of a wagon, Bronn tells him that the Lannisters won the battle, but it was a feint. As a diversion, Robb sent a small portion of his army to confront and delay Tywin's forces, while the main army marched on [[Riverrun]] to attack Jaime's army.[[File:Jaime captured.png|thumb|Jaime is captured by Robb's army.]][[File:Robb_Stark_after_the_battle.jpg|thumb|[[Robb Stark]] after his victory.]]
Catelyn and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] are waiting in woodlands as they hear sounds of battle. Suddenly Robb returns from his victory with his guards and a prisoner: Ser Jaime himself. The [[Battle of Whispering Wood]] has lifted the siege of Riverrun, and Jaime's army has been destroyed. Jaime suggests they end the war now with a bout of single combat between himself and Robb, but Robb refuses and has him imprisoned. Robb laments that his diversion sent 2,000 men to their deaths. He gives a speech to his army and tells them that they have won a great victory, but the war is far from over.

=== At the Wall ===
[[File:Jon and Jeor.jpg|thumb|[[Jeor Mormont]] gives his sword [[Longclaw]] to [[Jon Snow]].]]At [[Castle Black]], Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] gives Jon Snow a [[Valyrian steel]] sword, [[Longclaw]], in thanks for saving his life. Mormont also reinstates Jon to his former position and tells him he has dispatched Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] to [[King's Landing]] to lay the hand of the [[wight]] they found at the feet of the King and ask for aid. 
[[File:Aemon 1x09.jpg|thumb|Maester [[Aemon]] reveals his true identity.]]
Mormont explains to Jon that Longclaw was meant for his own son, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], but he disgraced himself and fled in exile to [[Essos]]. Jon goes to the dining hall and the other recruits make a fuss over the sword, but [[Samwell Tarly]] seems distant from the revelry. Sam takes Jon aside and informs him about Robb leading an army south to war. Jon ponders that he should be with him, but Maester [[Aemon]] tells him their duty to the [[Night's Watch]] comes first. To Jon's surprise, Aemon reveals that his full name is Aemon Targaryen, the son of a king, brother to another, the uncle of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. Already old and blind at the time, Aemon had to stand aside and do nothing, trembling with rage as he recounts that even his nephew's grandchildren were butchered during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. It is not an easy life they have chosen. Aemon remarks that he cannot make Jon stay or go. Like the Maester, Jon must make the choice himself and live with the consequences of it for the rest of his life.

=== In the Dothraki Sea ===
[[File:Drogo's fall.jpg|thumb|[[Drogo]] after his fall.]]Far to the east, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is concerned that the wound her husband Khal [[Drogo]] took fighting [[Mago]] has festered and become infected. He falls from his horse, a grave sign of weakness amongst the [[Dothraki]]. Daenerys tells the khalasar that they are stopping and orders [[Qotho]] to get [[Mirri Maz Duur]] to help Drogo. [[Qotho]] is unhappy with entrusting Drogo's care to the woman, whom he calls a ''[[maegi]]'' or witch, but relents.
At Daenerys' request, Ser Jorah armors himself. Jorah also advises her to leave now, because Drogo is certain to die and when he dies, his lieutenants will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill Daenerys's son, rather than risk the boy growing up to be a rival, but Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband. Mirri Maz Duur promises to save Drogo's life, but she needs to sacrifice a life in exchange. She takes [[Drogo's stallion]] into his tent and starts the ceremony, slitting the animal's throat over Drogo's comatose form. As the crowd stands outside, loud growls are heard as a supernatural ritual begins.

[[File:Daenerys.png|thumb|[[Jorah Mormont]] helps [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]].]]
Some of Drogo's warriors become enraged at what they see as Daenerys' attempts to interfere with the natural way of things and Qotho tries to attack her, but Ser Jorah kills him. Daenerys starts to go into labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives will help her, thinking she is cursed. With no choice, Jorah takes Daenerys into the tent as the ceremony continues.

=== In King's Landing ===
[[Varys]] visits [[Eddard Stark]] in the dungeons under the [[Red Keep]]. Varys tells Eddard that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] begged for his life before the whole court and that [[Robb Stark|Robb]] is leading an army from the [[North]]. In addition, the Queen is more concerned over the intentions of [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]]'s brother, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], a proven battle commander known to be without mercy. For the sake of Sansa's life, Varys urges Eddard to confess to treason. In return, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] will let him take the black and join his younger brother [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] and [[bastard]] son [[Jon Snow]] on the [[Wall]]. Eddard is angered by the suggestion that he would trade in his honesty and honor for his life, though he appears to have second thoughts when Varys insinuates that Sansa would pay the price for his defiance.

[[Arya Stark]] is living rough on the streets of the city. She catches a pigeon and tries to trade it for a slice of bread, to no avail. She sees crowds moving through the streets and is told that the [[Hand of the King]] is being brought before the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], the center of religious worship in the city. Stunned that she will see her father, she drops the pigeon and joins the crowd. Unable to see, she climbs unto the pedestal of a statue of Baelor (a previous Targaryen king, Baelor the Blessed, for whom the Sept is named). She sees her father being brought in chains to the steps of the temple. He sees Arya on the statue, and as he is dragged through the crowd he passes [[Yoren]] of the Night's Watch (who had met Arya). Lord Eddard looks at the statue and says, "Baelor," puzzling the crowd. Yoren understands, however, and moves toward the statue where Arya is watching.

Eddard is given a chance to confess his "crimes." He weighs his choices as he sees both Arya and Sansa present, and chooses to save them by making a false confession. He says that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is the true King on the [[Iron Throne]], pleasing him. Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] extols the virtues of mercy and Joffrey agrees that he could be merciful and send Eddard to the Night's Watch as his mother has suggested and as Sansa has begged. He instead acknowledges that as women they are "soft" and treason must never go unpunished. He commands Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] to bring him the traitor's head.                 
[[File:Ned's execution.jpg|thumb|Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] executes [[Eddard Stark]].]]The crowd goes into an uproar. Arya tries to make her way through the crowd, drawing her [[Needle|sword]] to save her father, but Yoren grabs and stops her, shielding her from seeing her father's death. Sansa screams and is restrained by guards as she faints. A visibly horrified Cersei frantically tries to persuade her son to reconsider, as does Varys, but there is no time. Forced to kneel, Eddard looks at the statue and sees, to his relief, that Arya has been rescued by Yoren. Ser Ilyn draws Eddard's own sword, [[Ice]], and cuts his head off with a single blow. A flock of pigeons takes flight immediately afterwards, the sight being all Arya needs to know her father is dead.

I betrayed the faith of my King, and the trust of my friend, Robert. I swore to defend and protect his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son, and seize the throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say. Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne. By the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."<br />
'''[[Pycelle]]''': "As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just! But beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"<br />
'''[[Joffrey Baratheon]]''': "My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join the Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And my Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of ''women''. So long as I'm your King treason shall never go unpunished! Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"<br />

==Behind the scenes==
* The episode title refers to the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], the grand seat of the [[Faith of the Seven]] in [[King's Landing]], and from [[Baelor I Targaryen]], the King after whom the Great Sept was named and the statue of Baelor Targaryen that Arya hid under, and the fact that Yoren rescued her after Eddard said "Baelor" to him.
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of the [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#House Stark theme|House Stark theme theme]]. It did not appear on the [[Game of Thrones (Music from the HBO Series)|official soundtrack release]].
* Maester Aemon's count of the kings suggests that in the TV series the short rule of King Jaehaerys II has been eliminated, making the Mad King directly a son of King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V]] ('Egg' from the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]] by [[George R.R. Martin]]). Aemon even mentions 'Egg' by name.
* In the novels, Shae is a native of Westeros, but in the TV series has been made into a native of Essos to account for actress [[Sibel Kekilli]]'s accent. In the novels, Shae is around eighteen years old.
[[Image:The Twins Title Sequence.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Twins]], as shown in the [[Opening credits (Game of Thrones)|opening credits]].]]
* The [[Opening credits (Game of Thrones)|opening credits]] shift again, this time dropping the [[Eyrie]] in favor of the Twins.
* [[Eddard Stark]]'s word to [[Yoren]] before he is executed, "Baelor", refers to the statue of Baelor the Blessed, where Ned sees his daughter [[Arya Stark|Arya]]; thus signaling Yoren to protect her.
* The lines spoken by Pycelle prior to Ned's execution were spoken by the High Septon in the books. The High Septon, nevertheless, is still present in the scene as Ned mentions him. It was actually George R.R. Martin's idea to give the lines to Pycelle (given that they didn't want to make the High Septon a speaking role yet, for narrative focus).<ref>[https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/718327665015537664]</ref>
* One of the more substantial alterations from the novel occurs in this episode in that Tyrion rather comically is knocked unconscious before he can take part in the fighting, whereas in the novel he is an active (if reluctant) participant and holds his own against several opponents. In addition, the original novel has Tyrion telling his story of being set up with a whore to Bronn shortly after leaving the Eyrie. Cogman later stated that the reason for this was to keep the battle off-screen, while Tyrion was unconscious: they had originally planned to include the [[battle on the Green Fork]] on-screen (as in the novels) and even storyboarded it out - but towards the end of filming they simply ran out of budget and it became obvious that they had no realistic hope of including it. The massive success of Season 1 did lead to a larger budget in later seasons, including large on-screen battles, which Cogman hoped made up for their comparatively bare budget early on.<ref>[https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/718323896383115264]</ref>
*[[Bryan Cogman]] stated in his Twitter account that originally, the showrunners never intended to include the scene in which Tyrion explains his backstory with [[Tysha]] in Season 1 - keeping in mind that at the time, they thought they would be lucky to get renewed for a second season, so they didn't want to waste time introducing many plot elements that would only pay off in the future if they had no guarantee they'd even get another season. At the time, they did plan on giving the backstory about Tysha in Season 2, in the event that the show was renewed. As it happened, because the runtime of Season 1 came up short, they realized it was a great scene to put back in (also because it was a small, intimate scene only involving a few characters and wouldn't take much more time to set up). Cogman is also convinced that Dinklage's emotional performance in this Tysha backstory scene is what won him his Emmy Award for Best Supporting Actor in Season 1.<ref>[https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/718322690566856704] [https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/718322203968827392]</ref>
*Cogman stated that the fight between Jorah Mormont and Qotho was originally conceived as the much bigger fight it is in the novels, in which Rakharo would join Jorah in fighting all three of Drogo's bloodriders. Ultimately it had to be cut down due to time constraints - though Cogman still thinks that the more personal one-on-one fight between Jorah and Qotho in the final version still worked out great.<ref>[https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/718321740963819524 1/2] [https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/718321861701013508 2/2]</ref>
*Cogman said that the drinking game between Tyrion, Shae, and Bronn was added during the wave of rewrites late in production in Season 1, when they realized that the season was a bit short so they added in several character-building dialogue scenes that required little budget - and which in hindsight the writers felt didn't merely help fill out the run time but greatly added to characterization.<ref>[https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/718322344331198464]</ref>
*Tywin incorrectly refers to the [[hill tribes]] as "[[Free Folk|wildlings]]". The term refers to the people who live [[Beyond the Wall]]. The Hill tribes indeed are savage and uncivilized, but are not included in this social category.
*There are similarities between Ned's execution and the [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|execution of his father and brother]]:
**The executed ones are Starks.
**The executed ones are falsely accused of treason.
**The king who orders the execution is a homicidal psychopath.
**Each of the executions, rather than serve as a lesson to potential rebels, ignites a war against the king in question which results in his death.
**If the theory about Aerys and [[Joanna Lannister]] is correct (see "[[The Winds of Winter#Notes]]"), in both cases the king who orders the execution is a descendant of [[House Targaryen]].
*Similarly to the [[Lannister scout]] ("[[The Pointy End]]"), Catelyn claims that the Northern host consists of 20,000 men, instead of 18,000 (the number Robb told her in the previous episode). The scout was wrong probably because he made a rough assessment of the Northern troops; Catelyn presumably increases the number to make Lord Frey more willing to cooperate.
*Jorah warns Daenerys "This isn't Westeros where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new Khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs." Apparently, Jorah missed the irony in his words, which meant to underscore the Dothraki's savagery: during the [[Sack of King's Landing]], the Lannisters did the exact thing he described to baby [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)]] (in addition to the foul murders of his mother and sister) despite his royal origin, thus the "civilized" people of Westeros are not better than the savage Dothraki.
**The use of the word "dogs" could refer to [[Gregor Clegane]], who committed the aforementioned atrocities; he is known as "Tywin Lannister's mad dog", and the sigil of his house is an image of three dogs.
*Greatjon Umber and Theon warn Robb that if he enters the Twins alone, Lord Frey may sell him to the Lannisters, throw him in a dungeon, or slit his throat; this could be a foreshadowing of the [[Red Wedding]].

==In the books==
{{Main|Differences in adaptation/Game of Thrones: Season 1#"Baelor"}}
