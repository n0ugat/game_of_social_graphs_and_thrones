'''Rohanne of Tyrosh'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} is the widow of [[Daemon Blackfyre]].

==Biography==
The marriage between Rohanne and Daemon was arranged by Daemon's half-brother, King [[Daeron II Targaryen]].{{Ref|H&L803}} She and Daemon had at least four children: [[Aegon Blackfyre|Aegon]], [[Aemon Blackfyre|Aemon]],{{Ref|GOT106}} [[Daemon Blackfyre (son of Daemon)|Daemon]], and [[Haegon Blackfyre|Haegon]].{{Ref|H&L803}}

==Family==
{{Blackfyre tree (A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms)}}

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Rohanne was betrothed to Daemon by King [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]] and the [[Archon]] of [[Tyrosh]]. After Aegon's death, his successor Daeron II finalized the marriage in 184 AC and paid a dowry to the Archon.

While the marriage had been arranged to ensure an alliance with Tyrosh, Daemon supposedly wished to marry his half-sister [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys]] instead, and had expected to wed her polygamously, which King Daeron refused.{{Bookref|TWOI&F|4|12}}

Rohanne and Daemon had seven sons (including Aegon, Aemon, Daemon, Haegon, and Aenys) and at least two daughters (including Calla). 

After the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]] on the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], her brother-in-law [[Aegor Rivers|Bittersteel]] managed to rescue her and her surviving children and flee with them to Tyrosh.{{Bookref|TWOI&F|4|12}}
