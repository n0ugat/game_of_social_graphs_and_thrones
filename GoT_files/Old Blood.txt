{{Quote|To this day, only those who can trace their ancestry back to Old Valyria are allowed to dwell within the Black Walls. None are even permitted to set foot inside without an express invitation of a scion of the Old Blood; meaning, of course, the ancient and noble blood of footsoldiers.|[[Varys]]|Volantis (short)}}
'''Old Blood'''{{Ref|H&L503}} is the collective term by which the aristocratic families of [[Volantis]] are known. They consider themselves heirs of the [[Valyrian Freehold]], but they are not descendants of [[dragonlord]]s but of the foot soldiers that made up the garrison - and the only settlers - of the early Volantis.{{Ref|H&L503}}

Only the Old Blood is allowed to live behind the [[Black Walls]] of eastern Volantis. Any outsider - [[Slavery|slave]], freedman, or foreigner - requires an express invitation of a member of the Old Blood to be allowed inside.{{Ref|H&L503}}

==Known members of the Old Blood==
*[[Talisa Stark]], of the [[Maegyr family]]
*[[Belicho Paenymion]]

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Old Blood is made up of families who can prove unbroken descent back to [[Old Valyria]]. Only they can be eligible for the post of [[Triarchs of Volantis|triarch]], though all freeborn landowners have the vote.
