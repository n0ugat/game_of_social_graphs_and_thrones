Prince '''Aegon Targaryen''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Āegon Targārien''}} called '''Aegon the Younger''' to distinguish him from [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], is a [[prince]] of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]]. He is bonded to the dragon [[Stormcloud]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Aegon is the third child and first son of [[Daemon Targaryen]], and fourth child of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. He is presently fourth-in-line in the succession to the Iron Throne, behind his three half-brothers from her first marriage to [[Laenor Velaryon]]: [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], and [[Joffrey Velaryon]], though this position is disputed by the [[Greens]].

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
When Aegon is four, he travels with his family to [[King's Landing]] to defend the succession rights of his half-brother Lucerys to [[Driftmark]]. He and his younger brother [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]] are introduced to their grandfather/uncle, the ailing King [[Viserys I Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

After his uncle [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] [[Coup in King's Landing|usurps]] the throne, his [[Hand of the King|Hand]], Ser [[Otto Hightower]], delivers terms to Rhaenyra, which include Aegon the Younger having a high place at court as the King's [[squire]]. Daemon, and later Rhaenyra, furiously reject this.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Rhaenyra plays with him and [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]] in her chambers. Following the attempted [[Duel on Dragonstone|assassination]] on her, she decides to sends him, Viserys, [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] to the [[Eyrie]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}

At the castle of Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]], Aegon play with toys with his little brother while his baby dragon [[Stormcloud]] watches them. Lady Jeyne arrives to tell Rhaena that [[Reggio Haratis]] has agreed to take her, and her siblings, and that the ''[[Gay Abandon]]'' will take them there.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Aegon leaves the Eyrie with Viserys and Joffrey.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Behind the scenes==
Four-year-old Aegon is portrayed by twin child actors [[Jake and Rory Heard]].<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/CasFMVusJAY/?hl=en Davina Hart on Instagram: “How cool is it to be only 3 years old and have this on your acting cv! 🎬😎🥰💙💙 #twinactors #aegon #youngeraegon #redgun #leavesdonstudios…”]</ref>

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Aegon was born in 120 AC at [[Dragonstone]]. He had dark purple eyes and pale silver hair. Queen [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] took offense to his name, considering that she already had a son named [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], and believed that the boy's name was a slight intended by Rhaenyra to imply that her own son was more deserving of the [[Aegon I Targaryen|Conqueror]]'s name than Alicent's. Rhaenyra's son was called "Aegon the Younger" to differentiate him from his half-uncle, who began to be called "Aegon the Elder."
