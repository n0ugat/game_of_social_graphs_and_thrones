'''Skroth'''{{Ref|GOT101}}{{Note|[[Common Tongue]]: ''Ice''}} is the [[Languages|language]] spoken by the [[White Walkers]]. It sounds like the cracking of ice.

==Behind the scenes==
The credits for episodes of [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] of the TV series include the statement: "Dothraki, Ashai'i, and Skroth languages created by the Language Creation Society and [[David J. Peterson]]."

Peterson developed a spoken language for the White Walkers to use in Season 1 (probably in the unscreened [[Pilot (Game of Thrones)|pilot]]), but ultimately, it was not used on-screen, and was dropped entirely from [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]]. Instead, actual ice-cracking sound effects were used when the White Walkers are conversing.{{Webref|name=Dothraki |author=David J.

In an interview with ''Entertainment Weekly'' during Season 2, Executive Producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] stated that "Skroth" is indeed the official name of the language used by the White Walkers. According to the interview, the inhuman (and unpronounceable) sounds of Skroth, "ice-cracking chatter", were created by Sound Designer [[Peter Brown]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20141025202412/http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/27/game-of-thrones-blackwater-2/2/ ‘Game of Thrones’: How producers pulled off ‘Blackwater’ (27 May 2012, arched 25 October 2014)]</ref>

In an interview with ''Huffington Post'' in February 2019, Peterson briefly discussed how Skroth was created and then cut from the pilot - and actually for the first time [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-unaired-pilot_us_5c0af138e4b0ab8cf6934dbe shared a clip of what it sounded like] (though again, it is no longer the canon version of what the White Walkers' language looks like).

==In the books==
The ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels clearly state that the "Others" ("White Walkers" in the TV series) speak a language that sounds "like the cracking of ice on a winter lake," but the name of the language is not given.
