'''Sumai'''{{Ref|GOT204}} is a blood oath in the law of the [[Essos|eastern]] city of [[Qarth]]. It allows a resident of the city to vouch for outsiders who wish to enter it. The one who invokes it must cut the palm of a hand and show the wound to those who can bear witness to the act being done by the invoker; it was implied that,  to establish equality among the city's ruling members, once the oath has been done by anyone of them it cannot be undermined by any of the others.

[[File:Xaro_invokes_sumai.png|thumb|Xaro invokes Sumai.]]
[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] invokes Sumai to vouch for [[Daenerys Targaryen]], her ''[[khalasar]]'', and her [[dragon]]s, to allow them to enter Qarth after the [[Thirteen]] refuse them entrance into the city. The [[Spice King]] comments "be it on your head", suggesting that Xaro shall take the full responsibility for allowing Daenerys's [[Dothraki|party]] in.<ref>"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of Sumai or any similar blood oath. Daenerys is not refused entrance into Qarth. On the contrary, she's welcomed and well treated because her dragons are considered a marvel.
