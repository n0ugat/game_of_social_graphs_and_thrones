{{Quote|You ever get lonely, I am partial to older gentlemen.|Craya to [[Qyburn]]|Winterfell (Game of Thrones)}}
'''Craya''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] in [[King's Landing]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Along with [[Marei]] and [[Dirah]], Craya is hired by [[Bronn]]. They lament that some of their favorite boys were killed by [[Drogon]] in the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], with Craya mourning [[Archie]] and [[William]] in particular. As Marei mounts Bronn, Craya tells Dirah that a soldier named [[Eddie]] survived the battle but returned to [[King's Landing]] with his face burned off, leaving him without eyelids, to which Dirah asks how he sleeps without eyelids.{{Ref|GOT801}}

The encounter comes to an early end when [[Qyburn]] enters the room and informs Bronn that he has an urgent request from [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. As she leaves, Craya tells Qyburn to visit her if he gets lonely, as she is partial to older gentlemen. Once she has left, Qyburn comments that a pox will kill her within the year. Hearing that, Bronn nearly chokes on his wine.{{Ref|GOT801}}
