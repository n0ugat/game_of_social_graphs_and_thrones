{{Quote|When Khal Mengo's son, Khal Moro, laid waste to the Waterfall City of Sathar, renaming it "The Place of Wailing Children", the Tall Men finally realized their peril.|[[Jorah Mormont]]|The Dothraki}}
''Khal'' '''Moro''' was a [[Dothraki]] ''[[khal]]''.

==Biography==
''Khal'' Moro laid waste to the Waterfall City of [[Sathar]], after which he renamed it "The Place of Wailing Children". This event made the [[Sarnori]] realize just how perilous the [[Dothraki]] were, causing them to rally together behind the High King [[Mazor Alexi]].{{Ref|H&L608}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Moro had all of the men of [[Sathar]] put to the sword once he conquered the city, with the women and children being carried off as slaves to the morts in the hill city of Hazdahn Mo, which was a colony of the [[Ghiscari Empire]]. He then had the city burned to the ground, renaming it Yalli Qamayi, the place of Wailing Children.

Six years later, Moro formed an alliance with the King of Gornath by marrying one of his daughters to him, razing Kasath with his aid. Moro was killed by Horro twelve years later.
