'''Salty Town'''{{Ref|GOT509}} is presumably a suburban area of [[Braavos]].

[[Mace Tyrell]] performs a boisterous Braavosi ballad in which Salty Town is mentioned to an irate [[Tycho Nestoris]].<ref>"[[The Dance of Dragons (episode)|The Dance of Dragons]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Salty Town is never mentioned, although Braavos does have several suburban areas, including the Drowned Town.

Mace Tyrell never travels to Braavos in the timeline of the books, and so his tuneless rendition of the Braavosi shanty is never heard.
