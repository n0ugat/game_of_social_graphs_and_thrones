{{Quote|Baelor himself appointed a simple-minded stonemason, believing him the Smith reborn.|High Sparrow|Great Sept of Baelor (short)}}
This '''[[High Septon]]''' came to the attention of King [[Baelor I Targaryen]], who believed him to be the [[Smith]] reborn and appointed him as the [[High Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. 

==Biography==
A stonemason by trade, he came to the attention of King [[Baelor I Targaryen]], who believed him to be the [[Smith]] reborn and appointed him as the [[High Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. Following his death, he was succeeded in the position by an [[High Septon (boy)|eight-year-old boy]].{{Ref|H&L618}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the stonemason's original name was '''Pate'''. He was so skilled at his craft that [[Baelor I Targaryen]] believed him to be the [[Smith]] in human form and informed the [[Most Devout]] of this, appointing him as [[High Septon]]. However, Pate could not read, write or recite prayers, and proved completely incapable of performing the duties of the head of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. He held the position for only a year before a fever took him, though it was rumored that the [[Hand of the King]], [[Prince]] [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys Targaryen]], poisoned him to spare the realm the embarrassment of having such an ineffectual High Septon.
