==Synopsis==
=== At Winterfell ===
[[File:Burned bodies.jpg|thumb|Theon has the burned bodies raised on the walls of Winterfell]]
At [[Winterfell]], now held by the [[Ironborn]], [[Theon Greyjoy]] awakens to find that [[Osha]] is gone and she has escaped with [[Hodor]], [[Bran Stark]], [[Rickon Stark]] and their [[Direwolf|direwolves]]. Theon berates [[Black Lorren]] for allowing them to escape. When Lorren counters that Theon is also to blame for sleeping with Osha and letting his guard down, Theon furiously beats him. Theon leads the Ironborn on horseback to hunt down the boys with hounds to track them. The search leads them to a shepherd's farm, but the farmer says that he hasn't seen anyone. Dagmer finds some walnut shells, so they know that Bran and Rickon were there, but the hounds can't get the scent. Theon tells them the hunt is over and to return [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] to Winterfell: he knows where they are, and his mercy has been exhausted.

Theon returns to Winterfell. He announces that he is going to show them what happens to those who are not loyal to him: he hoists two bodies of small children, burned black and beyond recognition, to either side of the main gate. Seeing them, Maester Luwin cries out in grief and anguish, believing Bran and Rickon have been killed.

=== At Harrenhal ===
At [[Harrenhal]], [[Tywin Lannister]] is discussing the assassination of [[Amory Lorch]] with Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. Tywin is convinced that it was an assassination attempt on himself, unaware that [[Jaqen H'ghar]] actually killed Lorch on the request of [[Arya Stark]]. Ser Gregor speculates that the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] may have been responsible. Enraged, Tywin orders Gregor to burn out villages and farms in reprisal for this assassination attempt. Tywin later suspects that Arya is highborn, because she doesn't pronounce "m'lord" the way commoners do and says "my lord" instead, possessing an educated vocabulary. Arya makes the excuse that her mother, whom she said was a handmaiden for years to royalty, had taught her to speak properly like them.

=== In King's Landing ===
In [[King's Landing]], [[Sansa Stark]] comes to thank [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor "The Hound" Clegane]] for saving her life during the [[Riots in King's Landing|recent riot]] in the city and says that he was very brave. Sandor simply says that a dog doesn't need courage to fight off rats. Sansa is perturbed by his "hateful speech," but Sandor cautions that a day will come when his penchant for violence is all that stands between her and her "beloved" King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].

[[File:Caught.jpg|thumb|Sansa and Shae trying to flip the mattress.]]
Sansa awakens in her bed from a nightmare, only to find the sheets covered in blood because she has had her [[Flowering|first period]]. As she will be expected to marry and conceive a son with Joffrey when she begins menstruating, Sansa panics and frantically tries to get rid of the bloody sheets to remove the evidence. [[Shae]] tries to help Sansa hide the sheets but Sandor finds them.
[[File:Sansa and Cersei.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Sansa and Cersei discuss Sansa's womanhood.]]
Terrified of being brought to Joffrey, Sansa is instead brought before Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]], who in her own way tries to comfort her. Cersei reveals that King [[Robert Baratheon]] had abandoned her to hunt as she birthed each of her children, but that her brother [[Jaime Lannister]] insisted on being by her side the whole time, noting that Sansa should never expect such devotion from Joffrey. Cersei says that while Sansa will never love Joffrey, she will love their children and advises Sansa to love no one but her children — whom a mother can't help but love — because "the more people you love, the weaker you are." When Sansa asks if she should not love Joffrey, Cersei only answers, "You can try, little dove." 

Privately, Cersei meets with Tyrion and expresses regret at having children with her own brother Jaime. She wonders if Joffrey's violent personality is the price of her and Jaime's sins. Tyrion earnestly points out that her other two children, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], are good and decent children. Cersei and Tyrion share an odd moment of sympathy.

=== In the Westerlands ===
[[File:Alton's body.jpg|thumb|[[Torrhen Karstark]] discovers the body of [[Alton Lannister]].]]
At King [[Robb Stark]]'s army camp in the [[Westerlands]], close to an unidentified keep, [[Alton Lannister]] returns as an envoy giving [[The Night Lands|Queen Cersei's response]] to Robb's peace terms. Robb is unsurprised that she rejected them and imprisons Alton with his cousin [[Jaime Lannister]]. The nurse [[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]] discusses medical supplies she needs with Robb. Robb suggests she accompany him to the [[Crag]] to acquire the supplies she needs. That night, Jaime kills Alton to lure the guard, [[Torrhen Karstark]], into his cell. Jaime strangles Torrhen and escapes but is soon recaptured. Torrhen was the son of Lord [[Rickard Karstark]], one of the major nobles from the North. Lord Rickard demands Jaime's execution in revenge, regardless of his protected status as both a prisoner of war and a valuable political hostage. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is forced to argue for Jaime's life. Catelyn confronts Jaime and tells him that he has no honor. Jaime bitterly explains that his vows as a knight required him to defend the innocent and serve the king, but [[Aerys II Targaryen|his king]] was slaughtering the innocent. Jaime considers concepts like "honor" and "loyalty" naïve at best and hypocritical at worst. Jaime asserts that he has only been with Cersei and begins to ridicule [[Eddard Stark]], Catelyn's late husband, by bringing up the shame of Eddard fathering an illegitimate child with another woman. This brings Catelyn to breaking point and she asks for [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]'s sword.

===Beyond the Wall===
[[Jon Snow]] is still separated from the [[Night's Watch]] scouting group led by [[Qhorin]]. He attempts to locate them, traveling with his [[Free Folk|wildling]] prisoner [[Ygritte]]. She and Jon argue about freedom, his oaths, and who is invading whose lands. Jon tells Ygritte his father was Ned Stark and as Northman, he has the blood of the [[First Men]] just like she does, to which Ygritte asks Jon why the Watch fights the wildlings. She states that the animosity of the southerners toward the Wildlings is arbitrary, given that the Wildlings are only distinguished from them by living north of the Wall when it was constructed. She mocks Jon's sexual inexperience, surmising that he is a virgin. She taunts him by offering to teach him how to have sex. She escapes and leads him into an ambush. Ygritte says that Jon should have taken her when he had the chance.

===In Qarth===
[[File:The Thirteen 2x07.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys asks The Thirteen for help.]]
[[Daenerys Targaryen]] is desperate to find her stolen [[dragon]]s. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] returns and she orders him to find them. [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] claims to be distressed at breaking his promise to protect her, fearing that his word will be publicly seen as worthless. Jorah questions [[Quaithe]] of [[Asshai]]. Quaithe knows that Jorah once betrayed Daenerys by spying on her. Quaithe warns Jorah that the man who stole the dragons is already with Daenerys. Jorah finds Daenerys, in the company of [[Kovarro]], pleading with the council of the [[Thirteen]] to find her dragons. The [[Warlocks|warlock]] [[Pyat Pree]] confesses to stealing the dragons and declares Xaro the King of Qarth. Doubles of the warlock then magically appear behind the other members of the Thirteen and slit their throats, leaving only Pyat Pree and Xaro. Xaro secretly entered into an alliance with Pyat Pree to become king. Pyat Pree urges Daenerys to find her dragons at the [[House of the Undying]] as the three flee.

<br />
'''Sansa''': "Does it give you joy to scare people?" 
<br />
'''The Hound''': "No, it gives me joy to kill people. Spare me. You can't tell me Lord [[Eddard Stark]] of Winterfell never killed a man." 
<br />
'''Sansa''': "It was his duty. He never liked it."<br />
'''The Hound''': "Is that what he told you? He lied. Killing is the sweetest thing there is."

'''___________________________________________________'''

'''[[Cersei Lannister]]''': [to Sansa] "Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day. The more people you love the weaker you are. You'll do things for them that you know you shouldn't do. You'll act the fool to make them happy, to keep them safe. Love no one but your children. On that front a mother has no choice."<br />'''Sansa''': "But shouldn't I love Joffrey, Your Grace?"<br />'''Cersei''': "You can try, Little Dove."

'''Tyrion''': "Sins? The Targaryens..."<br />
'''Cersei''': "Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. It's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt.

'''Catelyn''': "And gag him!"<br />

'''___________________________________________________'''

'''Catelyn''': "You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took."<br />
'''Jaime''': "So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the King, obey the King, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your [[Tywin Lannister|father]] despises the [[Aerys II Targaryen|King]]? What if the King massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this [[Brienne of Tarth|beast?]]"<br />
'''Catelyn''': "She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."<br />
'''Jaime''': "Kingslayer. And what a king he was! Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the second of his name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back!"<br />
'''Catelyn''': "You are a man without honor."<br />
'''Jaime''': "Do you know I've never been with any woman but Cersei? So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of the [[Jon Snow|bastard]] he fathered?"<br />
'''Catelyn''': "Brienne."<br />
'''Jaime''': "No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now when- when good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord [[Eddard Stark]] ''fucked'' another [[Wylla|woman]]."<br />

==Behind the scenes==
*The title of the episode comes from a line by [[Catelyn Stark]] to [[Jaime Lannister]], the Kingslayer: "You are a man without honor."
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of the [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#House Greyjoy theme|House Greyjoy theme]]. It did not appear in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2 (Music from the HBO Series)|official soundtrack release]].
*Tywin Lannister states that the current civil war in the Seven Kingdoms is being called "the War of Five Kings." This is the first time that the conflict has been named on-screen - though the formal name is ultimately the "[[War of the Five Kings]]." It is referred to in dialogue as the "War of ''the'' Five Kings" in Season 4 episode "[[The Lion and the Rose]]".
*Tywin claims that every child alive still knows Aegon the Conqueror's name 300 years after his death. This is incorrect because at that point of the show, the year is 299 AC, and Aegon died on 37 AC, thus 262 years passed since his death. Note that the years in Westeros are counted from Aegon's conquering of the realm, not from the year he died.
*In the "ThronesCast" interview series, actor Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (who plays Jaime Lannister) mysteriously refers to a scene in this episode as his favorite moment in the series and his favorite scene he's ever acted in. He later explained in the HBO featurette for this episode that he was referring to the scene between Jaime and Alton Lannister.<ref>"A Man Without Honor" HBO featurette</ref>
*Tyrion made comments similar to Ygritte's back in Season 1 when he visited the Wall, pointing out that the "[[Free Folk|wildlings]]" are basically just those people whose ancestors were unfortunate enough to happen to be living north of the Wall when it was built. Both the inhabitants of the [[North]] (south of the Wall, ruled by the Starks) and the wildlings are descended from the [[First Men]]. They have much closer ethnic ties to each other than the foreign [[Andals|Andal]] invaders who now dominate all of southern Westeros. Both groups even have the same religion, worshiping the [[Old Gods]], as [[Osha]] pointed out in Season 1.
*According to episode director David Nutter, the episode was filmed not long after the footage of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi's death was circulating heavily in the news, during which Gaddafi was surrounded by a frenzied mob eager to exact "eye for an eye" vengeance. Nutter said that he was loosely inspired by the visual energy of this footage when he was shooting the scene in which Jaime Lannister has been recaptured after killing Rickard Karstark's son, and is dragged back into camp by an angry mob of Northern soldiers who want to immediately kill him.<ref>"A Man Without Honor" HBO featurette</ref>
*Daenerys says that Viserys "would have let 1,000 men rape me if it had got him the crown". Actually, his words were much nastier: "I would let his [Drogo's] whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that's what it took" ("[[Winter Is Coming]]").
