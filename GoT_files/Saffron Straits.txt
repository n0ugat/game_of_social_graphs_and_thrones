The '''Saffron Straits'''<ref name="Map">[[:File:HotD Far East Map.jpg]]</ref> are the eastern exit of the [[Jade Sea]].

The straits divide [[Essos]] from the mysterious land of [[Ulthos]] to the south. The city of [[Asshai]] is on the northern side of its western entrance. The straits widen to the east, and then continue beyond the [[known world|world]] known to [[Westeros]].<ref name="Map" />

==In the books==
In ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'', the knowledge of the Saffron Straits is much the same. Due to their position at the edge of the known world, little else is known about the Saffron Straits, other that it contains the island of Ulos.
