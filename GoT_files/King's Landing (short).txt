==Narration==
'''Varys''': ''[[King's Landing]] is both a city and a curse. [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] was the first [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] to [[Aegon's Conquest|land]] there. His first conquest, a tiny village at the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush|Blackwater River]], where he raised a [[Aegonfort|wooden fort]].''

''When it became clear that Aegon would earn his [[King|title]], people flocked to the fort and renamed it "King's Landing" in his honor. The ploy succeeded, and Aegon chose King's Landing for his capital over older and more beautiful cities like [[Oldtown]] and anywhere else.''

''The currying of royal favor thus became the foundation of the city, and blood its bricks. [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]], Aegon's son, completed the city's famous [[Red Keep]] to hold the trappings of power: the [[House Targaryen|royal family]], the [[Kingsguard]], and the [[Iron Throne]].''

''To maintain the new castle's secrets, Maegor murdered all its masons and craftsmen at a feast, which he catered with the new castle servants, who soon found all its secrets for himself.''

''When the [[Faith Militant]] [[Faith Militant uprising|challenged]] his rule, Maegor [[Burning of the Sept of Remembrance|razed]] their [[Sept of Remembrance]] to the ground with them inside at prayer and erected the [[Dragonpit]] on the ashes. But the great [[dragon]]s it housed were [[Storming of the Dragonpit|attacked]] by the very [[Smallfolk|lowborn]] people they were meant to terrify.''

''Thousands of people died in the attempt, but hundreds of thousands lived in King's Landing, and now the only dragons in the city are [[Money|golden]].''

''Like most kings, Aegon and Maegor missed a central truth – that a king lands is less important than what he lands on. The people, who will never visit his Red Keep, or his Dragonpit, or any of his noble monuments to [[Noble house|nobility]], because they're too busy holding up his [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]].''

''Without the slums of [[Flea Bottom]] and the poor and desperate folk it produces, who would fight the king's wars and cook the king's [[Food and drink|meals]] and admire him as he rode past at speed?''

''Without its winding dark alleys and [[Bowl of brown|pot-shops]], where would the Red Keep empty its sewage? Of all kinds.''

''Without the [[Street of Flour]], the king would have no bread.''

''Without the [[Street of Steel]], the king's armies would have no swords, armor, or victories. Without the [[Street of Looms]], the king would go naked, and without the [[Street of Silk]], he wouldn't enjoy it.''

''Without the [[Street of the Sisters|Street of Sisters]], the king would have no humility; it leads from the ruin of the Dragonpit to the ruin of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], where the Targaryens and [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|Baratheons]] buried their kings until [[Cersei Lannister]] [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|unburied them]].''

''Now those kings are ashes, scattered on the wind, and nobody marked where they landed. A palace without people is a tomb. A realm without people is scenery.''
