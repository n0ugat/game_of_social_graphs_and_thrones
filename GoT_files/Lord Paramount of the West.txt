'''Lord Paramount of the West'''{{Ref|HOTD105}} was a title used by [[Jason Lannister]] instead of "[[Warden of the West]]." It is unknown if other heads of [[House Lannister]] used this style.{{Note|In "[[The Pointy End]]," [[Tywin Lannister]] is styled only as "[[Lord of Casterly Rock]] and Warden of the West." "[[The Field of Fire - House Targaryen]]" mentions [[Loren I Lannister]] being named "Lord Paramount of the [[Westerlands]]," but as this title is never mentioned anywhere else this is assumed to be an error. Because the similar title "Lord Paramount of the West" is used with another title not used by any other head of House Lannister ([[Master of Casterly Rock]]), it is assumed that this title was only used by Jason.}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, no such title is mentioned. Unlike the lords vassal who [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] raised to lords paramount ([[House Baratheon|Baratheons]], [[House Tully|Tullys]], and [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]]), kings who bent the knee to him ([[House Arryn|Arryns]], [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and [[House Stark|Starks]]) never received the official style of "[[Lord Paramount]]."
