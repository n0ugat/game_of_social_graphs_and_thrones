'''Morven Casterly''' was the mother of [[Aurelia Casterly|Aurelia]] who lived during the [[Age of Heroes]]. She was a relative of Princess [[Ianthe Casterly|Ianthe]] and the [[Casterly king]].

==Behind the scenes==
On October 30, 2018, ''Variety'' announced that [[Naomi Watts]] had been cast as a lead role in ''[[Bloodmoon]]'', a ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' [[World of Westeros|prequel]] [[Pilot (Bloodmoon)|pilot]]. Her character was described as "a charismatic socialite hiding a dark secret."{{Webref|name=Variety |author=Justin Kroll, Joe Otterson |date=October 30, 2018 |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/game-of-thrones-prequel-pilot-naomi-watts-hbo-1202977630/ |title=‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Casts Naomi Watts in Lead Role  |website=Variety |access-date=December 6, 2023 }} On July 21, 2020, ''Redanian Intelligence'' revealed that her character was the mother of [[Amy McPherson]]'s character, [[Aurelia Casterly|Aurelia]].<ref name="Redanian" /> On February 6, 2024, artist Adam Pescott posted storyboards from the pilot in which the character was named "Morven." The storyboards confirm that, in a photo also leaked by Flora Moody, Morven is worshipping at a Sept to the [[Faith of the Seven]] built in a cave inside [[Casterly Rock]].<ref name="Instagram" />

While storyboard images did identify her as "Lady Casterly," and thus her full name was "Morven Casterly," this was probably not her ''maiden'' name. Given that she is seen worshipping at a sept, and linguist David J. Peterson said that he wrote Ancient Andal lyrics for songs at the Casterly Rock wedding, it seems that Morven was a foreign Andal noblewoman that Lord Casterly took to wife.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and its supplementary material, there is no mention of a character named Morven Casterly. She was an invention of [[Jane Goldman]] for ''Bloodmoon''.
