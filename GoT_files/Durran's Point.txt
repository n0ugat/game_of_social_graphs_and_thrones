'''Durran's Point'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} is a promontory on the northern shore of [[Shipbreaker Bay]] in the [[Stormlands]]. The castle of [[Storm's End]] is built on top of it.

==History==
According to legend, [[Durran Godsgrief]] built his first castle upon the promontory that would later be known as Durran's Point. After he won the love of [[Elenei]], daughter of the [[God of the sea|sea god]] and [[Goddess of the wind|wind goddess]], the gods sent a storm to destroy the castle. Durran declared war on the gods and built a new castle in defiance, and it too was destroyed. This continued until the seventh castle, Storm's End, withstood the rage of the gods.{{Ref|H&L112}}{{Ref|H&L314}}

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Durran's Point is named after Durran Godsgrief, the founder of [[House Durrandon]] and builder of Storm's End. There is no safe anchorage beneath it. It is on the path of great storms that form in the [[Summer Sea]].{{Bookref|TWOI&F|7|8}}
