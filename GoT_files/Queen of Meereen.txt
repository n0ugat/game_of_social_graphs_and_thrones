The '''Queen of Meereen'''{{Ref|GOT406}} is the ruler of the [[Slaver's Bay|Bay of Dragons]] operating from the city of [[Meereen]]. This title was held by [[Daenerys Targaryen]] during her [[Liberation of Slaver's Bay|campaign]] in Slaver's Bay, in which she liberated the enslaved populace of the slave cities. Since she has returned to [[Westeros]] to take the [[Iron Throne]], she appointed [[Daario Naharis]] the [[regent]] of the Bay of Dragons, so that he can represent her [[House Targaryen|house]] in her absence.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>
