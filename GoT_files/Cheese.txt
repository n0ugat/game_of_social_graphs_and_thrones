'''Cheese''' was a ratcatcher in the [[Red Keep]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Cheese is an indebted gambler working as a ratcatcher in the lower levels of the Red Keep. Through his work, he discovered and became familiar with King [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]]'s secret tunnels and passages.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Under the orders of [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] using his knowledge of the Red Keep's secret tunnels and passages, he along with Blood sneaked into the castle in order to assassinate [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] for murdering [[Lucerys Velaryon]]. Since he and his accomplice [[Blood]] could not find him, they went into [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]]'s room to murder the King's son. Cheese holds [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] at cut throat and forces her to reveal which of the twins was her son; Helaena reluctantly complies and points out her son. Blood is skeptic that she would give up the kings heir so easily but Cheese looks into her eyes and claims she is telling the truth. The duo then decapitate and kill the prince.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

While Blood chose to go deliver Jaehaerys's head to Daemon to receive the rest of his payment, Cheese chose to stay in Kings Landing and lay low. However, before he could escape, Blood was captured and imprisoned by the gold cloaks. During his interrogation by [[Larys Strong]], Blood told about his accomplice. After learning this information, [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] furiously ordered all the rat catchers of the Red Keep to be executed. Cheese and the other rat catchers were then hanged and displayed along the walls of the city for all the smallfolk to see.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Cheese's body was left hanging along the walls with the other rat catchers for weeks.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

After Aemond was named prince regent following the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]], he ordered for the rat catchers to be removed from the walls. Cheeses rotted corpse was then cut down and disposed of along with the rest.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==Behind the scenes==
Cheese is codenamed "Charlie C" in casting calls.{{Webref|name=Casting |author=Gravemaster |date=February 3, 2023 |url=https://redanianintelligence.com/2023/02/03/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-casting-two-more-roles-including-blood/ |title=House of the Dragon Season 2 Casting Two More Roles, including Blood |website=Redanian Intelligence |access-date=December 6, 2023 }} In April 2023, ''Redanian Intelligence'' confirmed that [[Mark Stobbart]] had been cast as Cheese and that he was expected to work on the second season until September 2023.{{Webref|name=Mark Stobbart |author=Gravemaster |date=April 12, 2023 |url=https://redanianintelligence.com/2023/04/12/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-adds-cheese-and-more-casting-news/ |title=House of the Dragon Season 2 Adds Cheese and More Casting News |website=Redanian Intelligence |access-date=December 6, 2023 }}
