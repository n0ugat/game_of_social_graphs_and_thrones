Prince '''Vaegon Targaryen'''{{Con|F&B}} was the seventh child of King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]] and Good Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]].{{Guideref|Jaehaerys I Targaryen}}

==Biography==
Vaegon's claim to the throne was briefly considered among 13 other claimants at the [[Great Council at Harrenhal]]. Only Prince [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] and Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] gained considerable support, however.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Vaegon was born in 63 AC. He was exceedingly bookish, and people around him considered him sour. Having never claimed a [[dragon]], he was called "Vaegon the Dragonless."

It was assumed that he would marry his sister [[Daella Targaryen|Daella]], but Vaegon showed no interest in her. In 73 AC, he insulted Daella to tears after one of the queen's companions asked when the two would marry. His older sister [[Alyssa Targaryen|Alyssa]] poured a flagon of wine over his head for that, to which Vaegon replied that she had wasted [[Food and drink#Wines|Arbor gold]].

At the king's request, Prince [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]] started training Vaegon at arms. Even after a year Vaegon did not improve, having neither the talent nor the interest. On their final session, Baelon made Vaegon fight their sister Alyssa, hoping that the prospect of losing to a girl would make him put in more effort. Alyssa mocked and danced around him in the yard, and finally Vaegon threw down his sword and stormed off.

[[Grand Maester]] Elysar once gave Vaegon a pornographic book, hoping it might increase Vaegon's interest in women. He kept the book, but showed no change in behavior.

In 78 AC, the king and queen sent Vaegon off to the [[Citadel]] of [[Oldtown]] to become an [[archmaester]] (Grand Maester Elysar firmly stated that Vaegon did not have what it takes to be a household [[Order of Maesters|maester]]). He was apparently pleased by this, as Jaehaerys told Alysanne that he thought Vaegon had almost smiled. He eventually earned a ring, rod, and mask of yellow gold, signifying an expertise in mathematics or economics.

In 101 AC, after the death of Prince Baelon, Vaegon was supposedly offered the title of [[Prince of Dragonstone]] by the king, which he refused. It was Vaegon who then proposed the [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council of 101 AC]]. Despite his disinterest in the throne, and his vows as a maester disinheriting him, his claim was briefly discussed at the Great Council as all possible options besides Viserys, Rhaenys, and [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]] were left open for discussion.

Vaegon is not mentioned in ''Fire & Blood'' after the Great Council. It is unknown whether he lived during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]: it is physically plausible, as he would have been only 66 years old by the outbreak of the civil war in 129 AC.
