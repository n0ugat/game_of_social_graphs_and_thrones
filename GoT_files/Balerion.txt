{{Quote|Balerion was the last living creature to have seen Old Valyria before the Doom.|Viserys I Targaryen|The Heirs of the Dragon}}
'''Balerion''', known as the '''Black Dread''', was the [[dragon]] ridden by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]]. He was so large, it was said his shadow could swallow an entire town when he took flight.{{Ref|GOT104}}{{Ref|GOT207}}

Balerion, named for [[Balerion (god)|one]] of the [[Old Gods of Valyria]], was no bigger than a horse when [[Daenys Targaryen]] claimed him. When she went to sleep that night, she [[Dragon dream|dreamt]] of the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]] that would befall [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]] twelve years later.{{Ref|THTDB201}}

Balerion became Aegon the Conqueror's mount during the [[Century of Blood]], and they participated in destroying the [[Volantis|Volantene]] fleet in [[Lys]].{{Ref|HOTD106}} During the War of the Conquest, Balerion was employed by Aegon to [[Burning of Harrenhal|burn and half-ruin]] [[Harrenhal|Harrenhal]], which resulted in the extinction of [[House Hoare]] and the ascension of [[House Tully]] as [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]].{{Ref|C&R03}} Upon the climactic battle of the [[Field of Fire]], Balerion, alongside the dragons of Aegon's sisters, [[Vhagar]] and [[Meraxes]], participated in the destruction of the largest army ever fielded against them. The outcome of the battle was the extinction of [[House Gardener]] and the respective ascensions of [[House Tyrell]] and [[House Lannister]] as [[Warden of the South|Wardens of the South]] and the [[Warden of the West|West]].{{Ref|C&R05}} Following Aegon's coronation as [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]], [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms]], and [[Protector of the Realm]], Balerion used his fiery breath to melt the swords of his rider's defeated enemies and forge them into the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|C&R08}} Aegon would also deploy Balerion in burning several castles across [[Dorne]] throughout the [[First Dornish War]] alongside [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] and Vhagar to [[Dragon's Wroth|avenge]] the [[Attack on Hellholt|deaths]] of [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and Meraxes.{{Ref|C&R09}}

During the [[Faith Militant uprising|uprising]] of the [[Faith Militant]], Aegon and Visenya's son, [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]], mounted Balerion and [[Burning of the Sept of Remembrance|burned down the Sept of Remembrance]] with hundreds of members of the Faith Militant inside.{{Ref|H&L502}} Following the destruction of the sept, Maegor would replace its ruins with the [[Dragonpit]] to house Balerion and the other Targaryen dragons.{{Ref|H&L701}} When Maegor's nephew, Prince [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon Targaryen]], attempted to claim the Iron Throne from his uncle, Maegor mounted Balerion to kill Aegon and his dragon [[Quicksilver]] during the [[Battle Beneath the Gods Eye]].{{Ref|H&L806}}

Years before his accession to the throne, Prince [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys Targaryen]] bonded with and rode Balerion. Viserys would be the last Targaryen to bond with Balerion, as the dragon died of old age not long after.{{Ref|HOTD102}} Following Balerion's death, Vhagar would grow to rival him in size, and she remained the only dragon of House Targaryen to approach such size by the time of the Dance of the Dragons.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Balerion was the last surviving dragon from [[Old Valyria|Valyria]]. When the Targaryens resettled on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] to escape the coming [[Doom of Valyria]], they took five dragons with them, but four of these (whose names are not mentioned) later died, leaving only Balerion. However, the other dragons did leave behind eggs, from which hatched Meraxes and Vhagar. He was named after a [[Balerion (god)|Valyrian god]]. His fire was black with red streaks throughout.

Balerion would have been only about a dozen or so years old when the Doom of Valyria occurred, very much still a juvenile.

Aegon personally used Balerion to burn out Harrenhal. Balerion destroyed the castle all by himself, as the other two dragons were away fighting other campaigns. He then took part in the Field of Fire alongside Vhagar and Meraxes.

After Aegon I died, Balerion bonded with his second son [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]], known as "Maegor the Cruel". His first son Aenys succeeded Aegon upon his death, but Aenys had already bonded to the dragon Quicksilver. Maegor refused to attempt to bond with any dragon in his youth, intentionally waiting until his father died and Balerion was available for a new rider - feeling that he was worthy of nothing less than riding Balerion himself. Shortly after bonding with Balerion, Maegor took him to the [[Vale of Arryn]] to suppress the rebellion of Jonos Arryn, who had deposed and murdered his elder brother [[Ronnel Arryn|Ronnel]] in a bid to regain the Vale's independence. Aware the [[Eyrie]]'s position would not save it from Harrenhal's fate, Jonos' co-conspirators betrayed and murdered him by way of the Moon Door, then surrendered in the hopes of gaining mercy; Maegor instead had them all executed. When Maegor was exiled to Pentos for his illegal second marriage to [[Alys Harroway]], he took Balerion with him. Balerion would return to Westeros with Maegor when his mother Visenya summoned him back to claim the crown following Aenys's death.

Maegor made extensive use of Balerion in attempting to suppress the [[Faith Militant uprising]], including burning hundreds of members of the Faith Militant when he destroyed the [[Sept of Remembrance]] in  King's Landing. He also participated in the major battle at the Great Fork of the Blackwater, albeit the rebels intentionally attacked during a heavy rainstorm so Balerion would have difficulty flying.

After Maegor's death and the ascension of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]], Balerion remained riderless for several years, residing alongside a riderless Vhagar and the other Targaryen dragons in the yards of Dragonstone while construction of the [[Dragonpit]] continued in King's Landing. When the seat was given over to Queen [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena Targaryen]], King Jaehaerys's widowed sister, by the King's order, the dragons became the constant companions of the queen's daughter Aerea Targaryen. Aerea had been raised for most of her years in King's Landing, first as the acknowledged heir of King Maegor and then of King Jaehaerys, and she had loved the attention lavished on her as a queen-in-waiting. After her mother had asked for her to be placed in her care, Aerea was moved to Dragonstone where she grew miserable with the lack of attention and failed to get on with her mother. After the birth of King Jaehaerys's first children and the failure of a promise from Good Queen Alysanne to return the girl to the capital, Aerea fled to the yards where she claimed her first dragon; no less a mount than Balerion himself. The princess and the dragon fled Dragonstone, not to be seen again for a whole year. Rumors of a beast haunting the hills of Andalos, of a great fire in the Disputed Lands of Essos and a dragon fighting in the fighting pits of [[Astapor]] reached the agents of the Iron Throne in the east, but none were believed by the Red Keep as being Balerion. A year after their disappearance, Balerion and Aerea returned to Westeros, landing in the courtyard of the Red Keep one day that would long be remembered.  Aerea returned gaunt and emaciated, and was afflicted with something that neither the Grand Maester nor Septon Barth had ever seen before; an infestation of worm-like creatures which had been roasting the girl from within, causing smoke to emerge from every orifice, including her mouth and nose and charring her skin like roasting pork crackling. Even as she lay suffering, she muttered of the terrible things she witnessed to Septon Barth and the Grand Maester, who never spoke of them in later years out of pure horror at what she'd faced. Only plunging her in a bath of freezing water was able to end the creatures, but it didn't save her, as her eyes boiled and burst and she died quickly afterwards As worrying as the creatures had been, something else had terrified the court even more: Balerion, the greatest of the Targaryen dragons, had been wounded, and bore a great bleeding gash roughly nine feet long across his neck. The last time Balerion had faced a beast similar to himself in combat had been Quicksilver at the Battle Beneath the God's Eye, and he had made short work of the smaller dragon.

Where Balerion, Aerea and the creatures had come from was never known, but one theory continued to dominate the minds of those who had seen the affliction that had killed the princess and wounded the Black Dread: Septon [[Barth]], King Jaehaerys's [[Hand of the King|Hand]], wrote an account claiming that the only place such things could have been found was in the smoking ruins of Valyria. Many had believed that Aerea had been the one to lead Balerion away but now the theory had been born that it had been the dragon that had taken the girl away. The Black Dread had been one of the five dragons taken by House Targaryen when they had fled Valyria for Dragonstone, and the only one who had survived to see the Conquest. This made Balerion the only creature to have witnessed Valyria at its height. Barth believed that the dragon had flown back to his homeland, taking the Targaryen princess with him. The creatures, and whatever had attacked Balerion, were most likely spawns of the sorceries the Valyrians had unleashed in their prime, or creatures born of the Doom that had claimed their civilization. Despite their lack of proof regarding Balerion and Aerea's destination, King Jaehaerys and his advisors were sufficiently worried about the aberrations that had killed Aerea Targaryen that they forbade any ship that sailed into Valyria from landing in the Seven Kingdoms, and made it punishable by death for Westerosi citizens to travel to Valyria and attempt to return.

Balerion lived to just over two centuries old. After Aerea Targaryen's death, he became the first dragon to be housed in the Dragonpit, where he remained for most of the Old King's reign. At one point, a young [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon Targaryen]] would hit Balerion on the snout when he entered the Dragonpit for the first time as a child, earning him his moniker of "Baelon the Brave". None claimed the Black Dread again until Jaehaerys's grandson, the future King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]], though it is notable that decades earlier, princess [[Alyssa Targaryen]] was also tempted to claim Balerion before settling on claiming [[Meleys]] due to her being younger and faster. By the time Viserys claimed him, Balerion had ceased to grow and was weakened by old age. When Viserys claimed him, he struggled to rise and could only fly around the city three times before returning to the Dragonpit. Viserys had originally planned to fly him to Dragonstone, but feared Balerion at this point lacked the strength to do so. A year later, Balerion the Black Dread passed of old age, leaving Vhagar as the only surviving dragon from the time of Aegon's Conquest.

Balerion was the greatest Targaryen dragon who ever lived, the largest since the fall of Valyria. Dragons keep growing for their entire lives, meaning that Balerion was even larger during the Faith Militant uprising. Only Vhagar ever managed to approach Balerion in size, but only many years after his death. Vhagar was the youngest of the original three Targaryen dragons and therefore was not as large as the others. By the time of the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons in 130 AC, however, Vhagar was approaching two hundred years in age, and had become nearly as large as Balerion during Aegon's Conquest. During the Dance, Vhagar's body core was said to be about five times larger than a war horse, meaning that Balerion was somewhat bigger than this. Balerion's skull was the largest in the collection of 19 dragon skulls that the Targaryens displayed in the Red Keep.

Balerion apparently mated with both Vhagar and Meraxes, though the exact lineage of subsequent Targaryen dragons has not yet been directly stated.

Balerion was colored black (hence his sobriquet of "The Black Dread"). Even his wings were black. Generations later, soon after Daenerys's dragons hatch, the resemblance between [[Drogon]] to Balerion makes the bloodrider [[Aggo (The North Remembers)|Aggo]] say amazingly "There sits Balerion, come again". Daenerys answers it may be so, but gives him a new name for his new life.{{Bookref|ACOK|12}}

[[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]] had a black kitten she named "Balerion" after the mighty dragon.{{Bookref|AGOT|58}}

In homage to Balerion, Daenerys renames one of the ships [[Illyrio Mopatis]] sent her after him.{{Bookref|ACOK|63}}

[[George R.R. Martin]] stated that if he could ride a dragon, he'd choose Balerion.<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Month/2019/08/ So Spake Martin, August 08, 2019]</ref>
