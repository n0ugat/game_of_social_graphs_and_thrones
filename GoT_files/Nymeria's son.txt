'''Nymeria's son''' was the son of the warrior-queen [[Nymeria]] and [[Davos Dayne]].{{Con|TWOI&F}}

==Biography==
After defeating his grandfather [[Vorian Dayne]] and sending him to the [[Wall]], Nymeria took Davos as her second husband and together they had a son.{{Ref|H&L613}} However, in accordance with Rhoynish custom, the title of [[Prince of Dorne|Princess of Dorne]] passed to [[Nymeria's daughter]] by her first husband [[Mors Martell]].{{Ref|H&L509}} This son presumably inherited his father's name and titles and furthered the family line that included Ser [[Joffrey Dayne]], Queen [[Dyanna Dayne]], and Ser [[Arthur Dayne]], all of whom would play just as important role in Dorne as their relatives in [[House Martell]].{{Ref|H&L613}}
