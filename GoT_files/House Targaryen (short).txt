==Narration==
'''Viserys Targaryen''': ''The [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty united the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and lasted nearly three centuries. It was a dynasty forged in fire, sealed in blood, and destroyed by [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]].''

''The Targaryens are blood of the dragon, descended from the [[Dragonlord|nobility]] of ancient [[Old Valyria|Valyria]], a once-mighty [[Valyrian Freehold|empire]] in the [[Essos|east]]. When the cataclysmic [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]] laid waste of Valyria and its people, the Targaryens survived, having settled in the island fortress of [[Dragonstone]] years before. They remained there for a century until the rise of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]].''

''Instead of attempting to reclaim the eastern lands of his ancestors, Aegon sailed west for the Seven Kingdoms, his sisters [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] at his side. To keep the bloodlines pure, Aegon continued the custom of his Valyrian ancestors and took both of his sisters to wives.''

''Together, they came ashore on the eastern coast of [[Westeros]]. Their blazon: a [[dragon]] with three heads, representing Aegon and his sister-wives. Their words: "Fire and Blood."''

''While their host was small when compared to the armies of the Seven Kingdoms, Aegon and his sisters had a secret weapon. The last of the dragons.''

''He [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered]] every kingdom, save [[Dorne]], which eventually bowed to Targaryen rule a century later. He had the swords of his enemies melted down by the fiery breath of his dragon, [[Balerion]] the Black Dread, and forged into the [[Iron Throne]].''

''The capital city of [[King's Landing]] was built on the eastern coast, where Aegon and his sisters first came ashore. And Aegon ordered the construction of a royal castle on its highest hill, the [[Red Keep]].''

''For three hundred years the Targaryen dynasty stood strong, in the face of rebellion, civil war, and plague. But the line of dragon kings was broken when my father, [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name]], was overthrown in rebellion.''

''My father was betrayed and slaughtered by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], a member of his own [[Kingsguard]]. His son and heir, my brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], perished on the field of [[Battle of the Trident|battle]] at the hands of [[Robert Baratheon]], who claimed the Iron Throne for himself.''

''And so today, the only surviving members of the storied Targaryen dynasty are myself, Prince Viserys, rightful [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] of the [[Andals]] and [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms|ruler]] of the Seven Kingdoms, and my sister, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]].''

''We were spirited to the [[Free Cities]] of the east by loyalists. Here, we have lived in exile ever since, dreaming of a day when we will cross the [[Narrow Sea]] and take back my father's throne.''
