==Narration==
'''Jon Snow''': ''As a boy, looking out from [[Eddard Stark|my father]]'s [[Winterfell|castle]], I thought the sun could never set on the [[North]]. So vast did it seem. A part of me still does.''

''The North is by far the largest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and can fit the other six inside it. Not that the others care. Cold and damp, that's how the [[Southerner|southerners]] see the North.''

''But without the cold, a man can't appreciate the fire in his hearth. Without the rain, a man can't appreciate the roof over his head. Let the south have its sun, flowers, and affectations, we [[Northmen|Northerners]] have home.''

''Mine was once Winterfell, the ancient seat of my father's family, [[House Stark]], who have ruled the North since the [[First Men]] and were once the [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]].''

''Growing up, [[Catelyn Stark|Lady Catelyn]] made sure I knew I wasn't a Stark, no matter how much blood I shared with her trueborn children. But where their name rules over the North, mine is the North. Snow.''

''Our lands stretches from the [[Wall]] down to the [[Neck]], a narrow land that divides it from the rest of Westeros. Legend has it that the [[Children of the Forest]] [[Hammer of waters|flooded it]] in their [[War of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|war]] against the [[First Men]]. If that's true, every Northman owes them a debt of gratitude.''

''The swamps of the Neck are as good as the Wall for keeping out unwelcome armies. And if the swamps don't deter you, the [[crannogmen]] should. Small, shy people who rarely leave those swamps and who follow [[House Reed]], the gatekeepers of the North, and among the most important and loyal bannermen of House Stark.''

''Also a bit strange. I heard their oath of fealty once as a child. It's is like no other lords'. Ancient and dark, they swear by earth and water, by bronze and iron, and by ice and fire.''

''Where House Reed holds the gate to the North, [[House Manderly]] holds the port. [[White Harbor]], the closest thing to a southern city we have governed by the closest thing to a southern family we have. Generations ago, the Manderlys were driven from the [[Reach]], but the Starks gave them their land in return for fealty.''

''Now White Harbor is the richest city of the North, and the Manderlys the richest family. Not in gold and silver like their southern counterparts, but in fish and grain and trade.''

''As for the other great Northern houses, the Starks brought them into the fold during the [[Age of Heroes]].''

''[[Rodrik Stark|A Stark]] wrestled an [[Ironborn]] for [[Bear Island]] and gave it to the [[House Mormont|Mormonts]]. A Stark granted [[Karhold|a keep]] and land to a younger son, [[Karlon Stark|Karlon]], in return for putting down a rebellion. His family then grew up into [[House Karstark|the Karstarks]].''

''Starks fought the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] and their [[King-Beyond-the-Wall|Kings-Beyond-the-Wall]] beside the [[House Umber|Umbers]] of [[Last Hearth]], thus earning their fealty.''

''[[House Bolton|Boltons]]. Back then, they were the bane of the North. A few were even rumored to wear their enemies' [[Flaying|flayed]] skins as cloaks. But after centuries of war, they too [[Bending the knee|bent the knee]].''

''And so House Stark became the [[King in the North|Kings in the North]], but never forgot that they weren't <u>the</u> North.''

''When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] and his dragons landed on [[Westeros]], the [[King of the Rock|Kings of the Rock]] and [[King of the Reach|the Reach]] sent all of their men to [[Field of Fire|die]] to defend their grounds. [[Torrhen Stark]] knelt to spare his people the same fate. He placed duty above pride.''

''Just as my brothers in the [[Night's Watch]] had done for thousands of years at the [[Wall]]. Many think of it as the end of the world, but it's not.''

''I've seen how the land stretches much farther than any man knows into the [[Land of Always Winter]], where the [[White Walkers]] came from during the [[Long Night]].''

''After the First Men and the Children of the Forest beat them back, [[Brandon the Builder]] raised the Wall and set up the Night's Watch to guard the realms of men. He gave us our oath, our castles, and the [[Gift]], the lands behind the wall whose farmers and crops sustain us.''

''Southerners may now mock my black brothers as thieves, rapers and worse. And not without cause. But the North remembers why we're there. And if we fall, the South will get a very harsh and very cold reminder.''
