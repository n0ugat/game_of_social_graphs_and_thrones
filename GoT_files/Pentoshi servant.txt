{{Quote|It's too hot, my lady!|The servant to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]|Winter Is Coming}}
A '''Pentoshi servant''' is a servant, possibly a [[Slavery|slave]], in the manse of [[Illyrio Mopatis]], a [[Magister]] of the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Pentos]].

==Biography==
===Background===
[[Slavery]] is officially illegal in Pentos, due to a treaty it established a hundred years ago with the Free City of [[Braavos]], which abhors slavery. However, wealthy and powerful magisters in Pentos such as [[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]] often flout these restrictions: his bronze-collared "servants" are actually slaves in all but name.{{Cite}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
She is helping [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to prepare for her first meeting with [[Khal]] [[Drogo]]. She takes Daenerys' new dress from [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]] when he holds it out. She warns Daenerys that her bath is too hot as she steps into it but Daenerys is unfazed.{{Ref|GOT101}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, a chattering 16-year-old servant assists Daenerys with her bath. She does not give a warning but Daenerys does think about the temperature:

{{Quote|The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. "Ours is the house of the dragon," he would say. "The fire is in our blood."|''A Game of Thrones'', Daenerys I|A Song of Ice and Fire}}

In Pentos, slavery is forbidden due to a treaty imposed by [[Braavos]] a hundred years before the events in the novels. However, the wealthy Magisters flout this law and keep bronze-collared "servants" that are slaves in all but name. Some Magisters are even involved in the slave trade.
