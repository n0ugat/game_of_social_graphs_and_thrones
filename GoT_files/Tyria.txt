'''Tyria'''<ref>[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref> is a former city of the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. It was laid waste in the Doom of Valyria. Its ruins are now located on the same island as the ruins of Valyria itself, across the [[Smoking Sea]] from [[Oros]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tyria is connected by a Valyrian road to the ruins of the capital city of Valyria.
