[[File:The Bite.png|200px|thumb|right|A map showing the location of the Bite off the coast of Westeros.]]
The '''Bite'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a large bay located off the north-eastern coast of [[Westeros]]. It is an inlet of the [[Shivering Sea]]. It separates the southern coast of the [[North]] from the northern coast of the [[Vale of Arryn]], with the [[Neck]] running along the western edge of the bay. The islands known as the [[Three Sisters]] are located within the Bite.

Several northern settlements are on the coastland of the Bite. The castle [[Widow's Watch]] is on a peninsula that projects into the northern mouth of the bay. The city of [[White Harbor]] lies at the estuary of the [[White Knife]] river on the northern edge of the Bite. The town [[Ramsgate]] lies at the estuary of the [[Broken Branch]] river.

The [[Fingers]] peninsulas project into the southern mouth of the bay. Beyond the bay lies the [[Shivering Sea]], which extends to the north of [[Essos]], beyond the limits of the [[known world]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Bite is in the same location. In the distant past, ships from the North and the Vale clashed on the Bite.
