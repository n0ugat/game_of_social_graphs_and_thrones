The '''Horse Gate'''{{Ref|H&L607}}{{Note|[[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]]: ''Hrazef Emrakh''}} is the entrance to the ancient [[Dothraki]] city of [[Vaes Dothrak]]. It is composed of two stone horses, creating an archway by the conjoining of the horse's hooves.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Daenerys Targaryen]] and ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] enter [[Vaes Dothrak]] with his ''[[khalasar]]'' via the Horse Gate, along with [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]] and [[Jorah Mormont]], for the birth of Daenerys's [[Rhaego|child]].

A [[Wineseller|wine merchant]] that tries to kill Daenerys and her child, by [[poison]]ing, is punished by being dragged along the back of a [[horse]], naked, whilst the rest of the ''khalasar'' rides. His route takes him through the Horse Gate and out of Vaes Dothrak, as ''Khal'' Drogo proceeds onto [[Lhazar]].

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Daenerys enters Vaes Dothrak through the Horse Gate so that the ''[[Khalar Vezhven]]'' can decide if she will join the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]''.

Later, Daenerys and her new, giant ''khalasar'' leave Vaes Dothrak through the Horse Gate.
