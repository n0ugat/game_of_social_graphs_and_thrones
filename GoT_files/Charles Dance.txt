Dance also had a rare "good guy" Hollywood role as Dr. Clemens in ''[[wikipedia:Alien 3|Alien 3]]''. One of Charles Dance's more prominent film roles was as Soames, the MI5 agent who commanded the Cairo Gang during the Irish War of Independence, in the 1996 film ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Collins_%28film%29 Michael Collins]'' (which also featured [[Ian McElhinney]]).

==Game of Thrones==

In ''[[Game of Thrones]],'' Dance plays Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. He was confirmed in the role on 29 July 2010. He initially appeared as a guest star in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|first season]] and joined the starring cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]]. Dance first caught Benioff and Weiss's eyes for the role when they saw his work in ''Bleak House''.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/game-of-thrones/243771/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4]</ref>

Tywin is actually 58 years old when he dies, but in the corresponding section of Season 4, Tywin is said to be 67 years old in the TV series. This was probably done to match Dance's age. Also, while the name of Tywin's wife was [[Joanna Lannister]], Dance also had a wife named Joanna.

Dance never read any of the books, through his exit from the show at the end of Season 4. He was also made aware of his character's death from a fan encounter - not that he is entirely innocent of being spoiled about it. As he explained, a fan greeted him once and complimented that Tywin has a great death scene in the novels - he didn't say what it was, but Dance was so intrigued that he went ahead and asked him what was the specific manner of his death. Before that point he wasn't even aware that Tywin would die before the TV series ended.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/new-blu-ray-video-extra-game-of-thrones-fallen-roundtable/]</ref>
