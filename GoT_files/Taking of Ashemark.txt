The '''taking of Ashemark''' is an event in the [[War of the Five Kings]] and part of [[Robb Stark]]'s invasion of the [[Westerlands]], following the liberation of much of the [[Riverlands]] from [[House Lannister|Lannister]] occupation.

==History==
===Prelude===
The northern army led by Robb invades the Westerlands, surprising the host led by Ser [[Stafford Lannister]] at [[Oxcross]] and [[Battle of Oxcross|annihilating]] it.<ref>"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref> With the bulk of the Lannister force stationed at [[Harrenhal]] and the remnants of [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]'s army already scattered, the Westerlands are largely defenseless.

===Battle===
Following the victory at Oxcross, the Northern army sacks [[Ashemark]], seat of [[House Marbrand]].{{Guideref|Battle of Oxcross}}

===Aftermath===
Following the taking of Ashemark, Robb's army pushes deeper into the Westerlands, resulting in a new victory in a [[battle at the Yellow Fork]] and the subsequent [[Surrender of the Crag|surrender]] of [[House Westerling]].<ref>"[[A Man Without Honor]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, it is mentioned that Ashemark is easily sacked by Robb's army, and the keep's castellan is killed. Lacking the necessary strength to capture [[Casterly Rock]] or [[Lannisport]], the Northern army raids the Westerlands: [[Galbart Glover]] and Rickard Karstark raid along the coast, [[Maege Mormont]] captures thousands of livestock, and [[Greatjon Umber]] - who in the novels remains with Robb - captures the gold mines at [[Castamere]], Nunn's Deep, and Pendric Hills.
