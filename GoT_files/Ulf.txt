'''Ulf''' is a resident of [[King's Landing]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. He claims to be the [[bastard]] son of Prince [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon Targaryen]], and the half-brother of the late King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD203}} He is a [[dragonrider]] who rides the [[dragon]] [[Silverwing]].{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Ulf is known as a sot and raconteur among the people of King's Landing.<ref name="WBD2" /> He calls himself a [[dragonseed]] and claims to be a [[bastard]] son of [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon the Brave]],{{Ref|HOTD203}} though he later admits he's unsure if it's true.{{Ref|HOTD207}} He supports [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s claim to the [[Iron Throne]] and [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] as her rightful heir.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
While walking the streets of King's Landing, Ulf steals a potato from another man's basket. He then sees the ratcatchers of the [[Red Keep]] (including [[Cheese]]) who have been hanged on the orders of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]].{{Ref|HOTD202}}

[[File:2x3 Ulf Still.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ulf regales his companions with tales of his alleged Targaryen heritage.]]
Ulf visits a tavern in King's Landing, revealing his claim as the son of [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]] to some of his friends. When Aegon II arrives at the tavern, Ulf is the first to herald the former's arrival.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Ulf is eating thin broth in a tavern when he overhears [[Dyana]] and [[Sylvi]] talking about how the royal family is feasting in the [[Red Keep]], instead of providing food to the starving commoners. Ulf reminisces how his supposed half-brother [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] never held feasts when the smallfolk were deprived of food. Ulf later complains to the soldiers about having enough meat to feed the [[dragon]]s instead of the smallfolk, slowly inciting an unrest in King's Landing.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 6: "[[Smallfolk (episode)|Smallfolk]]" (2024).</ref>

In a tavern, [[Ulf]], who often boasted he has Targaryen ancestry, is urged to join the other dragonseeds heading to Dragonstone. Ulf is reluctant, claiming a leg injury, but he also harbors doubts regarding his real ancestry. <ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 7: "[[The Red Sowing]]" (2024).</ref>

The Dragonseeds arrive by ship at Dragonstone, where [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Queen Rhaenyra]] awaits them. Rhaenyra, followed by [[Lorent Marbrand|Ser Lorent]], [[Addam of Hull|Addam]], [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]], [[Gerardys|Maester Gerardys]], [[Mysaria]], some Dragonstone guards and the dragonseeds go to the base under [[Dragonmont|Dragonmount]], when they are all on the stone bridge, Rhaenyra commands [[Vermithor]] to show himself, after a while, from the shadows appears the mighty Vermithor growling, Rhaenyra commands him to calm down, which Vermithor does, he approaches Rhaenyra and she puts a hand on his muzzle and both she and Vermithor close their eyes, for a moment they remain still, then Rhaenyra opens her eyes and turns to the dragonseeds, asking who wants to be first and one of them, [[Silver Denys]], makes his way through the suitors and approaches Vermithor and Rhaenyra, Rhaenyra declares that the dragon will "speak" and leaves followed by hers while the guards remain at the entrance, Vermithor peers at the dragonseeds growling and, when Denys brings his hand closer shaking hand to try to claim him, Vermithor throws a blast of flame that burns him alive along with other Dragonseeds, then proceeds to burn and eat most of them alive while Rhaenyra watches in shock. The dragonseeds try to escape from Vermithor, Ulf, who had been knocked off his feet by Vermithor grabs a torch and runs into the tunnels beneath Dragonmount.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:House-of-the-dragon-s2-e7-silverwing.jpg|thumb|Ulf claims Silverwing and becomes a dragonrider.]]
Silverwing is resting in a cave in the Dragonmont when Ulf stumbles upon her and steps on a mound of her eggs. Silverwing sniffs and nudges Ulf several times before she accepts him as her rider. Later, Silverwing and Ulf fly above [[King's Landing]], provoking [[Vhagar]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] into pursuing them to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. But upon seeing Silverwing roaring alongside Vermithor and [[Syrax]], Aemond chooses to fly back to King's Landing.<ref name=":0" />

Angered by Ulf's insolence, [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]] threatens to hang him if he displays disloyalty or incompetence. During supper, Rhaenyra promises knighthood to Addam, [[Hugh]], and Ulf if they serve her well; she announces they leave in two days to attack [[Greens|Green]] strongholds, [[Lannisport]] and [[Oldtown]].<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 8: "[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]" (2024).</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
On December 2, 2023, [[HBO]] announced that [[Tom Bennett]] had been cast in the role of Ulf for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]].{{Webref|name=WBD |author=HBO |date=December 2, 2023 |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/house-dragon/hbo-releases-official-teaser-and-first-look-images-season-two-original-drama-series |title=HBO Releases Official Teaser And First Look Images For Season Two Of Original Drama Series HOUSE OF THE DRAGON |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=December 17, 2023 }} His character description reads as follows:
:''"A denizen of Kings Landing known as a sot and raconteur among the smallfolk."''<ref name="WBD2" />

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Ulf White, also known as Ulf the White and Ulf the Sot, was a [[man-at-arms]] in the garrison of [[Dragonstone]]. He had pale white hair and was known to be a heavy drinker. No information about his parentage - real or alleged - was given. While it was not impossible for him to be the actual bastard of a Targaryen prince (although his age is never specified), many of the dragonseeds on Dragonstone and Driftmark were actually descendants of other dragonseeds, and not the direct offspring of House Targaryen. For example, [[Silver Denys]] claimed to be a descendant of King Maegor I's bastard son.
