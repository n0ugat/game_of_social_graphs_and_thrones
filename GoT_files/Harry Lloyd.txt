{{Quote|As an actor, I had to see the story, and his role in it, through his point of view. Otherwise he would just be sneering and screaming all the time. He doesn't see himself as the villain. He's the hero of this story! That's how you have to play it...His is a singular obsession that drives everything: he wants his family's throne back, his birthright. It's like a religion, something he's never questioned. So you can't wink. You have to take it extremely seriously.|Harry Lloyd on playing Viserys Targaryen|Inside HBO's Game of Thrones}}
