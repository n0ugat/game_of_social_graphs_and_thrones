==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Aegon was named in honor of both [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon the Uncrowned]]. He was born prematurely in 52 AC and died three days later. Queen Alysanne blamed this on a woman who attacked her at Jonquil's Pool in [[Maidenpool]], believing the healing waters of the pool would have allowed Aegon to live if she had bathed there long enough.
