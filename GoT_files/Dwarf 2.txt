A '''dwarf''' makes a living by performing for other peoples' amusement.

==Biography==
===Background===
A [[dwarf]], he makes a living by performing for other peoples' amusement.{{Ref|GOT402}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
He is one of five dwarfs hired by King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] to re-enact the [[War of the Five Kings]] during the [[Purple Wedding]]. He dresses as [[Stannis Baratheon]] and rides a mount resembling [[Melisandre]]. [[Tyrion Lannister]] and many other guests find the spectacle in poor taste, and he instructs his squire [[Podrick Payne]] to pay each of the dwarves 20 Gold Dragons afterwards.{{Ref|GOT402}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are only two dwarfs jousting. They ride live animals, a dog and a sow. Their real names are revealed in ''A Dance with Dragons'' - Oppo (aka Groat) and his sister Penny.

The one meant as a mockery of Stannis bears a shield depicting the black stag on yellow of House Baratheon. Stannis is also vilified in a song by Galyeon of Cuy, which depicts Stannis as an envious and evil man, bordering on an stereotypical fantasy evil overlord, planning on usurping the [[Seven Kingdoms]].
