Lord '''Borros Baratheon''' is the head of [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]] during the late reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]], and also during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Borros was born in [[89 AC]].{{Dateref|Borros Baratheon}} He is a [[Knighthood|knight]]<ref>[[:File:1x1 Borros Baratheon Concept Art.png]]</ref> and the son of Lord [[Boremund Baratheon]]. He has four daughters: [[Cassandra Baratheon|Cassandra]], [[Maris Baratheon|Maris]], [[Ellyn Baratheon|Ellyn]], and [[Floris Baratheon|Floris]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Ser Borros.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Borros during the Heir's Tournament.]]
Borros participates in the [[Heir's Tournament]], where both he and his father are defeated by Ser [[Criston Cole]]. Despite his defeat, he is given a chance to joust against [[Daemon Targaryen]], but Daemon rides past him and chooses [[Gwayne Hightower]] instead.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Borros succeeds his father as Lord of Storm's End{{Ref|HOTD109}} by 132 AC.{{Dateref|The Green Council}}

At a meeting of the [[Small Council]], Ser [[Tyland Lannister]] claims that they may not assume the loyalty of Lord Borros, though perhaps he can be persuaded by arranging marriages for his daughters.{{Ref|HOTD109}} When the [[Dance of the Dragons]] starts, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] expects to sway Lord Borros to her side due to their shared blood through [[Rhaenys Targaryen]], and sends [[Lucerys Velaryon]] to remind him of his father's oath of fealty to her.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

[[File:TBQ Borros Baratheon Still 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Borros receives Rhaenyra's message.]]
Before Lucerys's arrival, Borros first receives Aegon's younger brother [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], and arranges his marriage to his daughter Floris, thereby sealing their families. When Lucerys later arrives with his mother's message, Borros summons his maester to read it to him. Borros is exasperated by Rhaenyra's insistence of his father's oath, noting that Aegon at least offered him a marriage pact. Borros then asks Lucerys which of his daughters he will marry, but Lucerys is already betrothed to [[Rhaena Targaryen]], so Borros dismisses him back to his mother, instructing him to tell her that he cannot be "whistled up" like "some dog." When Aemond then provokes a fight with Lucerys, Borros commands both to stand down, proclaiming he will not have the blood of an envoy spilled under his roof, and orders his guards to escort Lucerys out.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==Personality==
Borros, in contrast to his father, places what serves his own interests before loyalty.{{Guideref|Borros Baratheon}} He is illiterate{{Ref|HOTD110}} and is said to be "dumb as thunder."<ref name="Script">https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/House-Of-The-Dragon-It-Starts-On-The-Page.pdf</ref> That said, he is not without scruples, as he still respects [[guest right]], refusing to let Aemond harm Lucerys because the latter is an envoy.

==Behind the scenes==
Borros is portrayed by an unidentified stunt performer in "[[The Heirs of the Dragon]]." In "[[The Black Queen]]," he is portrayed by [[Roger Evans]].

The script for the first episode includes an extended piece of dialogue between Rhaenyra and Alicent at the tourney in which they mention Borros by name, right after his father Boremund is introduced. This would have established that Borros actually was the unidentified (and helmeted) Baratheon knight that Daemon passed over to fight Gwayne Hightower. In these deleted lines, Rhaenyra says she heard Borros hasn't learned to read even by the age of 23, to which Alicent remarks she's heard Boremund's attendants call Borros "dumb as thunder." These lines were not included in the final cut, in which the only remaining indication that Boremund's son also participated is Harrold's line that Criston unhorsed ''both'' Baratheons.<ref name="Script" />

A behind-the-scenes video reveals the contents of the letter written by Rhaenyra to Borros:{{Ref|THTDB202}}

''To Borros Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End,''<br>
''from Rhaenyra Targaryen, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms''<br>
''and Protector of the Realm:''

''I write as I am in need of your friendship. My half brother has chosen to betray''<br>
''our erstwhile king, and usurp my throne and birthright. Your father swore''<br>
''to me his loyalty when I was but a child. I pray that with you I may still find''<br>
''that bond as yet strong. Your allegiance and devotion remain foremost in my heart''<br>
''and will not go unrewarded.''

==In the books==
