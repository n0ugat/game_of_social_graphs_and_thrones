The '''''Khalar Vezhven'''''{{Ref|GOT603}} is a great gathering of all the [[Dothraki]] ''[[khalasar]]i'' at their capital (and only) city, [[Vaes Dothrak]] in the [[Dothraki Sea]].

The assembled ''[[khal]]i'' discuss and decide which lands to raid and which tribes to enslave. It is unclear how frequently each gathering occurs.

According to the [[High Priestess (Oathbreaker)|High Priestess]], a ''Khalar Vezhven'' is imminent, and one of the things the ''khali'' will decide is the fate of [[Daenerys Targaryen]], who violated Dothraki tradition by venturing out into the world instead of joining the ''dosh khaleen'' immediately after the death of her ''khal''.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref> During this gathering, the ''khali'' deemed Daenerys unworthy of becoming a ''dosh khaleen'' and in response, she killed every ''khal'' in attendance as well as numerous bloodriders by knocking over every flaming brazier in the building, setting it ablaze. When she emerged unscathed, every surviving Dothraki outside swore their allegiance to her, restoring her title as ''[[khaleesi]]'', albeit with a much larger force of 100,000 at her command.<ref>"[[Book of the Stranger]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the specific ''Khalar Vezhven'' seen in the TV series has not yet occurred, because Daenerys is only captured by the Dothraki in the last chapter of the most recent novel (corresponding to the Season 5 finale).

The overall custom of an assembly called a ''Khalar Vezhven'' has actually not been described in the novels - yet.

The prior novels did vaguely mention that Vaes Dothrak is large enough to hold all of the Dothraki ''khalasars'' when they periodically all return to the city, apparently for different cultural gatherings or religious ceremonies, etc.

"''Vezhven''" means "Great", "''Khalar''" might mean "gathering of Khals".

The concept of the ''Khalar Vezhven'' is similar to the real-world [[wikipedia:Kurultai|kurultai]], where the Mongol khans gathered to discuss important issues, including future invasions and the election of a new Great Khan.
