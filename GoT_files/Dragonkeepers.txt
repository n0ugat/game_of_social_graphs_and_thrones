The '''Dragonkeepers'''{{Ref|HOTD102}} are a monk-like order tasked with guarding and taking care of [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]]'s [[dragon]]s. They wear plain, humble garments and wield quarterstaffs. They also learn to speak [[High Valyrian]]. The Dragonkeepers are divided in ranks, including "Elder" and "Acolyte".{{Ref|HOTD102}}

== History ==
Founded by [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|King Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] in 56 AC after Princess Aerea Targaryen stole [[Balerion]] and subsequently died upon her return to [[Westeros]]. Stationed in King's Landing and Dragonstone island. In King's Landing alone, there were fifty Dragonkeepers. Members had shaved heads and wore light clothing, made up of both genders. They carry [[dragonglass]] daggers and have long quarterstaffs to direct the dragons around. Many of the Dragonkeepers only speak [[High Valyrian]], even when they are not actively attending to their duties. Elders require an Acolyte to translate. They are tasked with guarding dragons day and night wherever they might lair, the eggs in particular. In additon they helped young [[Dragonrider|dragonriders]] in mastering their mounts. The daggers are used as both protection and as means of suicide if they were immolated in [[Dragon|dragonfire]] (steel would melt).<ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 1: "[[The Heirs of the Dragon]]" (2022)</ref><ref name=":1">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 6: "[[The Princess and the Queen]]" (2022).</ref><ref name=":2">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 6: "[[Smallfolk (episode)|Smallfolk]]" (2024).</ref><ref name=":3">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 2: "[[The Rogue Prince]]" (2022).</ref>

=== [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|House of the Dragon Season 1]] ===
The [[Dragonkeeper Elder (The Heirs of the Dragon)|Elder]] and three other Dragonkeepers bring [[Syrax]] into the Dragonpit after [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] lands her at the entrance. He later brings Syrax to the funeral of Queen [[Aemma Arryn|Aemma]] and Prince [[Baelon Targaryen|Baelon]]. He watches stoically as Rhaenyra gives the command to cremate them.<ref name=":0" />[[File:OT Dragon egg.png|thumb|Dragonkeepers placing dragon egg in an incubator.]]The Elder brings the [[Small Council]] news of Prince [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] attacking him and his [[Dragonkeeper Acolyte (The Heirs of the Dragon)|Acolyte]], then stealing one of [[Dreamfyre]]'s eggs. He takes stern questioning by [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys]] in High Valyrian and then by Rhaenyra. He later accompanies [[Otto Hightower]] to [[Dragonstone]] to retrieve the egg. After Rhaenyra talks Daemon down, he begrudgingly tosses Rhaenyra the dragon egg before retreating with Mysaria and his retinue back into the castle. Rhaenyra turns the egg over to the care of the Dragonkeepers. <ref name=":3" />

Years later another Elder trains [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]] to command his [[dragon]] [[Vermax]]. Using [[Aegon II Targaryen|Prince Aegon's]] bond with [[Sunfyre]] as an example. As he speaks only High Valyrian, a Dragonkeeper acolyte translates for him.<ref name=":1" />

6 years later Daemon climbed the Dragonmont, the volcano overlooking Dragonstone castle, where he recovers three dragon eggs laid by Syrax from a nest. Then he hands them over to a Dragonkeeper Elder and his Acolyte to taken to an incubator.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 8: "[[The Lord of the Tides]]" (2022).</ref> 

Following Viserys death and the [[Greens]] usurping power, Daemon tells his captains to conscript the Dragonkeepers if need be to bolster their numbers.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 10: "[[The Black Queen]]" (2022).</ref> 

=== [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|House of the Dragon Season 2]] ===
Less than a week later, at the  Dragonmont platform, they welcome [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and [[Meleys]] back. Later they attend to Syrax and Rhaenyra.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 1: "[[A Son for a Son]]" (2024).</ref>
[[File:Dragonkeepers and eggs.png|thumb|[[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]], [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]] and the Dragonkeepers place eggs into incubator.]]
A few days later, [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena's]] party, comprising herself, [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]], [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]], [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]], several guards and a handful of Dragonkeepers to tend to Joffrey's dragon [[Tyraxes]] and Aegon's [[Stormcloud]], departs Dragonstone. She also entrusts an awed Rhaena with a clutch of four dragon eggs, insisting she will bear their hope for the future if the war goes against them.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 3: "[[The Burning Mill]]" (2024).</ref> 

On the day of the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]], they get Meleys ready for flying with Princess Rhaenys.<ref name=":4" />  Feeling despondent and with the need to prove himself as a ruler, Aegon heads to the Dragonpit to retrieve his dragon Sunfyre. The Dragonkeepers help keep the dragon calm while Aegon readies his armor and drinks wine. After Aegon embrace his dragon, they fly off together.<ref name=":4">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 4: "[[The Red Dragon and the Gold]]" (2024).</ref>[[File:S2 Dragonkeepers.png|thumb|Dragonkeepers in the Dragonmont.]]In the caves beneath the Dragonmont, Rhaenyra, Jace and a Dragonkeeper Elder watch as the Dragonkeepers sing a [[dragonsong]], ''[[Hāros Bartossi]] t''o call [[Seasmoke]] while [[Steffon Darklyn|Ser Steffon]], in their midst, repeatedly whispers in a low voice "[[Warrior|Great Warrior]] protect us." Suddenly, Seasmoke, [[Laenor Velaryon]]'s dragon, appears in front of the group. The Dragonkeepers present calm him with commands in High Valyrian. Ser Steffon also gives a few commands. After a moment of tension, the dragon seems to submit. Ser Steffon moves to approach, but when he appears more relaxed, Seasmoke reacts and, despite the commands of the Dragonkeepers, launches a flame that hits Ser Steffon and one of the Dragonkeepers before leaving. Rhaenyra watches shocked as Ser Steffon Darklyn, Lord Commander of her [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Queensguard]], burns in agony while the Dragonkeeper slits his own throat with a dragonglass dagger before Jacaerys takes her away.<ref name=":2" />
[[File:House-of-the-dragon-season-2-dragonkeeper.jpg|thumb|Elder confronts Rhaenyra over using the Dragonseeds.]]
After gathering [[Dragonseed|dragonseeds]] from King's Landing and waiting for them to claim a dragon, Rhaenyra descends to meet them, an Dragonkeeper Elder declares in [[High Valyrian]] that this is an abomination. Rhaenyra, still in High Valyrian, asks what he is talking about. The Elder says that he has already sent an [[Andals|Andal]] before a dragon and that "the judgement was delivered", and that she now wants to send more. Rhaenyra says that Ser Steffon was of Targaryen descent, but the Elder says that was blasphemy, that Ser Steffon was not a [[Dragonlord|Dragonlord,]] and that neither are the Dragonseeds. Rhaenyra then says that the gods sent them to them, but the Elder says that she did it. He then states that dragons are sacred as they are the last vestige of [[Old Valyria|Old Valirya's]] [[magic]] left in the world and not playthings for men, he also states that their order will have no part in this and leaves, followed by all the Dragonkeepers of Dragonstone.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 7: "[[The Red Sowing]]" (2024).</ref>
