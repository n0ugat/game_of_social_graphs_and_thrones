'''Warden of the North'''{{Ref|GOT101}}{{Note|Feminine: '''Wardeness of the North'''{{Ref|GOT504}}}} is a title traditionally held by the [[Lord of Winterfell]], the head of [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]], since [[Torrhen Stark]], the last [[King in the North]], [[Bending the knee|submitted]] to [[Aegon I Targaryen]]. Centuries later, [[Robb Stark]] was named the King in the North after [[Eddard Stark]], the previous Warden of the North, was [[Execution of Eddard Stark|executed]] under false charges. After Robb's death, the title was held by the head of [[House Bolton]] of the [[Dreadfort]] after House Bolton usurped House Stark during the [[Red Wedding]] and returned the North under the authority of the [[Iron Throne]].

With the extinction of House Bolton in the [[Battle of the Bastards]] and the subsequent declaration of the [[North]] as an independent kingdom once more, [[Jon Snow]], the alleged [[Bastard|illegitimate son]] of Ned Stark, was named the King in the North, a position he held until [[Bending the knee|pledging]] fealty to [[Daenerys Targaryen]], after which he is appointed Warden of the North. This event marks yet another unprecedented split in the Northern governance system; as with his title of King, Jon's title as Warden of the North was for the first time not held jointly with that of [[Lord of Winterfell]], which was held by his legal half-sister (and biological cousin), [[Sansa Stark]]. During Jon's incarceration by the [[Unsullied]] for murdering Daenerys, Sansa briefly served as Wardeness of the North. However, with Bran's accession as [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]], and Sansa's accession as [[King in the North|Queen in the North]], the position has been indefinitely abolished.
