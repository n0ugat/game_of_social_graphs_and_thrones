{{Quote|The other one is Jafer Flowers, my lord.|[[Othell Yarwyck]] to [[Jeor Mormont]]|The Pointy End}}
'''Jafer Flowers''' was a [[ranger]] of the [[Night's Watch]] and was killed while beyond the [[Wall]]. His body was found and returned to [[Castle Black]]. 

==Biography==
===Background===
Jafer Flowers is a ranger in the Night's Watch. His name, Flowers, suggests that he was a [[bastard]] from the [[Reach]] before joining the Watch. He and [[Othor]] accompanied [[Benjen Stark]]'s ranging mission beyond the Wall. Both Jafer and Othor are killed while on this mission.{{Ref|GOT107}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Ghost]] finds Jafer's severed hand in the [[Haunted Forest]].{{Ref|GOT107}} The corpses of Othor and the rest of Jafer are found [[beyond the Wall]] by [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]], [[Jon Snow|Jon]], and a party led by [[Othell Yarwyck]]. They return the corpses to Castle Black and suggest they be burned, but [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] decides to let Maester [[Aemon]] examine them first.{{Ref|GOT108}}

At night, the corpses rise as [[wight]]s. While Othor attacks Mormont, Flowers causes trouble elsewhere before being put down and burned. Both bodies are re-burned the next day, to be sure. Sam notes that according to a book he found in Aemon's library, the touch of the [[White Walkers]] can animate the dead.{{Ref|GOT108}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jafer Flowers's background is the same as in the show. 

Jafer's wight attacked the main castle garrison. It killed five men, among them Ser [[Jaremy Rykker]], and continued to attack even after having its head cut off - it was only subdued after being chopped to pieces by a dozen swordsmen.{{Bookref|AGOT|60}}

Unlike in the series, when the bodies of Othor and Jafer were brought to Castle Black, both corpses had blue eyes - different from the eye color they had in their lives.

Jafer's severed hand, which was torn by Ghost, continued to twitch and stir long after Jafer was destroyed. [[Alliser Thorne]] took it to [[King's Landing]], but it had rotted away while he was waiting for an audience.{{Bookref|ACOK|25}}
