{{Dialogue a-b|Ryger Rivers|Father please...|Walder Frey|I need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if I hadn't squirted you into her belly!|[[Walder Frey]] to his bastard son|Baelor}}
'''Ryger Rivers'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[bastard]] son of Lord [[Walder Frey]], the head of [[House Frey]] and [[Lord of the Crossing]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Ryger is present when [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] visits Lord [[Walder Frey|Frey]] to negotiate passage for [[Robb Stark|her son]]'s army across the [[Trident]]. Like his trueborn half-brother, [[Stevron Frey]], Ryger admonishes his father to remember his courtesies. Lord Frey rudely dismisses his son and reminds him that he's a bastard born of a milkmaid.{{Ref|GOT109}}

==Family==
{{Frey tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ryger is a natural son of Lord Frey and a woman who milked goats. He is described as being younger than Stevron Frey, who is 65 years old.

Ryger appears on-screen only in one book scene - when Catelyn enters the [[Twins]] to request that Lord Walder grants Robb's army passage over the river. The dialogue in this scene matches the parallel show scene fairly closely.
