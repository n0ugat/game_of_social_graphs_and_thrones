==Narration==
'''Samwell Tarly''': ''Nobody really knows how the [[Wall]] was built. Yes, every child hears how in the days of the [[First Men]], [[Brandon the Builder]] raised the Wall with [[magic]] and [[giants]] and set the [[Night's Watch]] to guard it.''

''But nobody thought to write down the story until thousands of years later, and the [[Septon|septons]] who did it weren't much for accuracy. I mean, they have [[Knighthood|knights]] bumbling thousands of years around before there ''were'' knights. Sorry, bad habit. But even if magic and giants built the Wall, it is the Night's Watch who have held it.''

''Our order of [[builder]]s repairs the keeps and towers, digs tunnels, crushes stone for roads and footpaths, and clears away trees wherever the forest presses too close to the Wall. Or at least they would if they had the men and the tools and the time.''

''Long ago, when the Night's Watch was at full strength, the Builders would quarry blocks of ice from the frozen lakes of the [[Haunted Forest]], dragging them south on sledges to add to the Wall. Now all they can do is watch for cracks or signs of melt and make what the repairs they can, without men, or tools, or time.''

''The order of [[ranger]]s is the fighting heart of the Night's Watch. They ride beyond the Wall fighting and trading with [[Free Folk|wildlings]], surviving [[shadowcat]]s and snow leopards. The rangers are meant to scout out threats to the Wall and return to report. And they did, back in the days when men could go north and come back alive. Now they just [[Wight|come back]].''

''The orders of [[Steward (Night's Watch)|stewards]] keep the Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the [[horse]]s, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals, and bring supplies from the south. Not so heroic, I know, but since the Night's Watch doesn't starve or freeze, I guess we are the only order that still does everything it's supposed to.''

''Without all of us guarding the Wall together, well, it probably still wouldn't have ever fallen. Solid ice rising hundreds of feet into the air and running hundreds of miles to the sea. No army is smashing it any time soon. Which is why our enemies have never tried. Well, not directly.''

''The brothers [[Gendel]] and [[Gorne]], [[King-Beyond-the-Wall|Kings-Beyond-the-Wall]], went under the Wall through ancient caves buried deep in the Earth. But on the way back, they took a wrong turn and were lost in the darkness. People say that their children's children's children are still down there looking for a way up, or for more food to find its way down.''

''When our Rangers found [[Arson Iceaxe]] picking away at the Wall, he was almost halfway through. The Rangers decided not to disturb him and seal the way behind him with ice and stone and snow. Some say if you place your ear flat to the Wall, you can still hear Arson chipping away with his ax.''

''A hundred years ago, another King-Beyond-the-Wall, [[Raymun Redbeard]], realized the Wall's size is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. He waited for our patrols to pass and then sent climbers to the now unguarded stretch of the Wall.''

''When they reached the top, they dropped ropes and ladders for thousands more wildlings to clamber up. The Night's Watch didn't even know his army had crossed until after the [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[House Umber|Umbers]] had cornered and destroyed him. And that was a hundred years ago. When the Watch had many more men than now.''

''Lucky for the Night's Watch, the Wall isn't without its own defenses. Besides being incredibly tall and thick, the Wall is also treacherous. Many times a patrol will find the broken corpses of wildlings who have tried to climb the Wall, only for a piece of it to break off mid-climb or to have their hold slip as the sun melted the ice just enough. When the light strikes the Wall just right, it can even look like it's weeping.''

''A thousand years ago, the Night's Watch could have lined up shoulder to shoulder along the Wall, all the way from [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] to the [[Shadow Tower]], to meet [[Mance Rayder]] and his army. But now Mance isn't bothering to find tunnels under the Wall or climb over it.''

''He was a sworn brother once. He knows that the glory of the Night's Watch is behind us. Mance is going to try what no man ever has. He's going to come ''through'' the Wall. One day, I hope [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] write stories about how we beat him back. Because if we don't, there may not be any more stories to write.''
