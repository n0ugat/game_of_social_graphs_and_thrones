{{Quote|I do not care to be a lady, Hugh. And neither do I want to be a widow.|Kat|The Red Sowing}}
'''Kat''' is a resident of [[King's Landing]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. She is the wife of [[Hugh]].

==Biography==
Kat is married to the blacksmith [[Hugh]], with whom she has one daughter.{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }} She has a brother who lives in [[Tumbleton]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Hugh returns home to nurse his ailing daughter. He shares the news of the Crown's impending payment but is incensed by the selfishness of some among the citizens of King's Landing, who hoard supplies for themselves at the cost of the most needy. 

After returning home to take care of her family, Kat tells Hugh that they must flee the city, as she fears Rhaenyra's retaliation; she proposes that they flee to [[Tumbleton]] where she has a brother, but Hugh doesn't want to live as a beggar. When Kat says that they are already begging for money, Hugh reminds his wife that he obtained the promise of payment from King Aegon II, but Kat tells Hugh that Aegon lied and that they will not be paid, and that if they continue living based on empty promises, their daughter, who needs food and medicine, will end up dying.

Hugh listens to Kat and the family tries to flee through one of the city gates, but the [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|gold cloaks]] block it and demand that the crowd disperse by order of Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]], whom they call prince regent and Protector of the Realm. Kat and another commoner ask if Aemond is king now, to which Hugh replies that he doesn't know.

Despite everything, Kat's daughter succumbs to her illness.

When [[Elinda Massey]] spreads the word that Rhaenyra is looking for Targaryen bastards who can attempt to claim dragons, Hugh, now grief-stricken from the loss of his daughter and determined to do something, heeds the call and leaves King's Landing for [[Dragonstone]], despite Kat's protests. Hugh confesses to her that he believes he might be able to claim a dragon due to his mother being a [[Saera Targaryen|Targaryen princess]], which he has never told anyone

==Behind the scenes==
Kat's character description reads as follows:
:''"Hugh’s wife and a devoted mother to their sick daughter."''<ref name="WBD" />

==In the books==
