The '''Kingswood'''{{Ref|GOT207}} is a forest in central [[Westeros]]. It begins in the [[Crownlands]] immediately south of [[King's Landing]] and extends into the [[Stormlands]]. The [[Kingsroad]] passes through the Kingswood as it runs from King's Landing to [[Storm's End]]. The [[Roseroad]] meets the Kingsroad within the forest. The Kingswood is the private hunting grounds for the rulers of Westeros. The [[white hart]] is considered the "King of the Kingswood" and a symbol of local pre-Targaryen royalty.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] slew Simon Toyne with a counter-riposte, impressing the fifteen-year-old [[Jaime Lannister]] (who killed his first man during the battle, beheading him).{{Ref|GOt103}}
