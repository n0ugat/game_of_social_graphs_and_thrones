==Biography==
===Background===
Alyn and his brother [[Addam of Hull|Addam]] are originally from [[Hull]], a portuary town in [[Driftmark]].{{Webref|name=Variety |author=Jordan Moreau |date =April 24, 2023 |url=https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-alys-rivers-season-2-1235592500/ |title='House Season 2 of the Dragon' features Alys Rivers and three other characters |website=Variety |access date=April 25, 2023 }} He and Addam are [[bastard]] sons of Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]].

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Alyn is in [[Spicetown]]'s harbor helping with repairs to the ''[[Queen Who Never Was|Sea Snake]]'', Corlys Velaryon's flagship, when the Lord of the Tides appears to oversee the repairs. Alyn greets his lord and informs him of the current situation at the [[blockade of the Gullet]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Corlys wants his ship ready to lead the campaign but Alyn responds that the ''Sea Snake'' will take weeks to be ready for battle again, although he promises to talk to his brother, Addam, to see if it is possible to enlist more shipwrights.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Alyn then gives Corlys a dagger that he commissioned for his grandson, the murdered Prince Lucerys. Alyn gives his condolences to Corlys calling Lucerys's murder "the blackest of treacheries" before returning to work. Corlys notes he was told it was Alyn who personally jumped into the sea to save him after his throat was slashed and he fell overboard in the ambush, and that he owes him a great debt, but Alyn says he was just doing his duty.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Alyn is helping the crew of the ''Sea Snake'' when his brother appears, whom he has not seen in many months. Both hug and walk away, joking about Alyn's adventures and what awaits them at home for lunch. It is then that Addam mentions his brother's loyal services to Lord Corlys Velaryon, and asks if he will leave with him when the ship is ready. Alyn answers that Corlys did not ask him to go with him, and that it is better that way, because Alyn knows that a [[Dance of the Dragons|bloody war]] is about to break out, even though Addam believes it is a great opportunity for his brother to gain fortune and reputation.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Alyn is continuing his work on the ''Sea Snake'' when [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] appears at the harbor. He addresses her as "milady," but she corrects him by asking him to call her "princess." Rhaenys says that she has been told that Alyn was the one to save Corlys's life in the Stepstones. Examining his face, she continues that she was not told how comely Corlys's savior was, and bitterly comments that [[Marilda of Hull|his mother]] must have been very beautiful. Corlys interrupts, and Alyn leaves to resume his work. Rhaenys tells her husband that she knows who Alyn is and that he should be raised and honored for his actions, not hidden away.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Alyn is still working on the ''Sea Snake''. He wears a turban to hide his Valyrian hair. While working, the [[Corlys Velaryon|Lord of Driftmark]] appears at the shipyard to pay him a visit. Alyn greets him, and Corlys professes that he wishes for Alyn accompany him as his first officer on the ''Sea Snake'' as soon as repairs are complete. Alyn initially wants to refuse, but Corlys insists that he accept the position and orders him to prepare to board the next day.

Back in [[Hull]], Alyn shaves his head. Addam finds this ridiculous, since anyone can identify him as Corlys' bastard with or without the silver hair. Addam pressures his brother to go with Corlys, believing that it may be the opportunity to be recognized as his natural son, and, perhaps, to compete for the [[Driftwood Throne]], but Alyn declares that, after a lifetime in the service to the [[House Velaryon]], he only wants to get away from Driftmark, and that Corlys would prefer that House Velaryon become extinct than recognize him or Addam as his children.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Alyn is loading fish onto the ''Sea Snake'' when his father arrives at the shipyard. Corlys orders him to fill a few fishing boats with soldiers and take them to the coast of King's Landing. Alyn accepts, and Corlys tell him that his brother Addam has claimed Laenor's dragon, [[Seasmoke]]. Though surprised, Alyn says that Addam has always been after glory, and that it would have been normal for him to do something like that. Corlys admits that he never knew of Alyn's mother's lineage and suggests that if she had Targaryen blood maybe Alyn has as well. Corlys suggests that Alyn could try to become [[dragonrider]] himself, but he refuses, stating that he is made for "salt and sea."{{Ref|HOTD207}}

Now on Dragonstone, Alyn receives a message from Lady [[Mysaria]] for [[Elinda Massey]], Alyn takes it, and goes with his ships to King's Landing to deliver the message to one of Mysaria's agents.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

Later on Driftmark, after his brother Addam had claimed as a rider by the dragon [[Seasmoke]], Alyn helps prepare the ''Sea Snake'' to sail when he is summoned by Lord Corlys to talk about the weather and setting out. Corlys explains that he wants to set out on good terms, and lauds Alyn's qualities as a first mate. Alyn states he is work to improve himself, and walks away before Corlys says that he is trying to help Alyn. Alyn stops, offended, and asks if it about being grateful. Corlys misses him, but Alyn walks back and angrily explains how life was like for him and his brother, as bastards without a father, left hungry and ashamed, starving while Corlys walked the markets with his son. Alyn continues to angrily note that their father only remembered him once his true born children were deceased and now wants his favor. He states he will serve due to his honor, but declines any offers of help and wishes to be alone if they survive the war before walking away from Corlys.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

Afterwards, Alyn and Corlys, now in full battle armor, take a rowboat to the ''Sea Snake''.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Personality==
Alyn is a humble, dignified and honorable man. He is ashamed of his condition as a [[bastard]] son of [[Corlys Velaryon]], shaving his head to hide his silver hair{{Ref|HOTD206}} and refusing to accept any help from him.{{Ref|HOTD208}} However, Alyn is loyal and will serve Corlys because it is his duty, even saving his life when he was wounded in combat. He can also show compassion toward him, finding what [[Fight above Shipbreaker Bay|happened]] to [[Lucerys Velaryon]] a treachery and offered his condolences for his loss.{{Ref|HOTD201}} He is also someone who does not seek power, saying that he is of "salt and sea" and yearns nothing more than serving and doing what he is asked to do.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Quotes==
{{Quote|You want to help me? Is this the help you offer after all these years? A reminder to be grateful? Do you know what it was like for us? To grow up fatherless, to be sneered upon as bastards, never sure of the bread to feed us? Do you know what hunger does to a boy? What grief does? Or shame? I sold fish in the market from cold dawn until sunset, putting by coppers to stave off the winter, and I watched the man who sired me walk past with [[Laenor Velaryon|his son and heir]], with a fur around his shoulders, choosing sweetmeats to eat after supper by the fire. And now that boy is dead. And [[Laena Velaryon|his sister]] before him. And the [[Lucerys Velaryon|heir that took his place]]. And now, now, now you remember I live. Now you wish to suddenly scatter the crumbs of your favor! I am an honorable man, and I will serve you because I must. But if it is all the same, I will decline any offers of help. If I survive this war, I will continue as I began... alone.|Alyn, to Corlys|The Queen Who Ever Was}}

==Behind the scenes==
On April 24, 2023, [[HBO]] announced that [[Abubakar Salim]] had been cast in the role of Alyn of Hull for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]].<ref name="Variety" /> His character description reads as follows:
:''"A young sailor who saved the Sea Snake’s life in battle at the Stepstones."''<ref name="WBD" />

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Alyn was a [[bastard]] son of Marilda of Hull, and younger brother of Addam of Hull. He was born in 115 AC, a year after his brother. He and Addam grew up in their maternal grandfather's shipyard and served on the trading cog ''Mouse''.{{Bookref|F&B|15}} 

No one doubted that Alyn and his brother were [[dragonseed]]s, since both had a silvery hair and purple eyes. According to their mother, their father was [[Laenor Velaryon]]; they looked like him, but the claim was questionable in view of Laenor's sexual preference. Grand Maester [[Munkun]] and Septon [[Eustace]] both dutifully asserted that Laenor was the father, but the court jester Mushroom claimed the father was Corlys. Laenor is unambiguously not Alyn's father in the TV series, as Alyn was alive when Laenor was a small boy.

Alyn did not fight in the War of the Stepstones, which ended the same year he was born (115 AC).

Unlike the series, in the books Alyn never met Rhaenys. The jester Mushroom claimed that Corlys kept Alyn and his brother Addam hidden so as not to offend his wife.
