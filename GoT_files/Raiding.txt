'''Raiding''',{{Ref|GOT205}} also known as '''reaving'''{{Ref|GOT205}} or '''pillaging''',{{Ref|GOT205}} is an activity in which several cultures take part. It is an attack on populated areas with the purpose of seizing weaponry, food, gold, or prisoners.

It forms the basis of the economies of the [[Free Folk]] [[beyond the Wall]] of [[Westeros]] and the [[Dothraki]] in central and western [[Essos]].

[[Ironborn]] also engage in raiding traditionally, though in their case raiding is also a [[Drowned God|religious]] activity. The Ironborn feel that raiding is their right, and have rebelled against the [[Seven Kingdoms]] to have the freedom to do so, among other things. This rebellion is known as the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. It ultimately ended in [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoy]] defeat, cementing the rule of King [[Robert Baratheon]], and resulting in Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s [[Theon Greyjoy|only surviving son and heir]] becoming a [[ward]] of [[House Stark]].

As a part of the agreement of their alliance, [[Yara Greyjoy]] promises to [[Daenerys Targaryen]] that the Ironborn will cease raiding after she conquers the islands, thus giving up a major part of the Ironborn culture.<ref>"[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"</ref>

In times of war, factions also engage in raiding to deprive the enemy of resources.
