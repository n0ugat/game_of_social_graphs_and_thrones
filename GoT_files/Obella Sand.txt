In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Obella's story is the same. She is twelve years old.

After [[Doran Martell]] hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he orders to arrest them lest they ignite a war with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and their younger sisters too (except [[Sarella Sand|Sarella]]), fearing that the young Sand Snakes may be used by others in plots against him.
