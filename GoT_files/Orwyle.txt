'''Orwyle''' is the [[Grand Maester]] on the [[Small Council]] of [[Viserys I Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Orwyle is a [[Order of Maesters|maester]] serving at the [[Red Keep]].{{Guideref|Grand Maester Orwyle}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Orwyle assists Grand Maester [[Mellos]] in treating an ailing King Viserys. When Orwyle says that he has prepared herbal medicine for the king, Mellos is dismissive, stating that leeching will be sufficient. After Mellos leaves, Orwyle gives the king a sleeping medication.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Ten years later, Orwyle has succeeded the late Mellos as Grand Maester. He attends a Small Council meeting in which a feud between the [[House Bracken|Brackens]] and [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]] is discussed along with the [[War for the Stepstones]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

After Viserys's death, Orwyle is present at the meeting of the Small Council where the [[Greens]] move to crown Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] in place of his half-sister [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]. After Lord [[Lyman Beesbury]] is murdered by Ser [[Criston Cole]] for protesting the plan out of loyalty to Rhaenyra, Orwyle requests leave to remove Beesbury's body from the Small Council chamber, only to be refused permission by [[Otto Hightower]]. Orwyle also agrees to the proposal to assassinate Rhaenyra and her family, pragmatically stating that leaving a rival claimant to the throne alive only invites bloodshed.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Orwyle is a part of the negotiation embassy sent to Dragonstone to convince Rhaenyra to surrender peacefully.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Orwyle is present at a meeting of the Small Council. When [[Tyland Lannister]] insists the navies of Houses [[House Lannister/House of the Dragon|Lannister]] and [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightower]] need to be reinforced to defeat the [[Velaryon fleet]]'s [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]] of the [[Gullet]], Orwyle suggests offering the vacant position of [[Master of Ships]] to Lord [[Dalton Greyjoy]] in hopes of gaining the [[ironborn]] as an ally. When Alicent asks if there have been any replies to her letters to Rhaenyra following the death of [[Lucerys]], Orwyle admits there hasn't, remarking they can only conclude Rhaenyra has rejected the peace terms offered and intends to declare war.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Orwyle is present at the hastily convened council session following the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murder]] of [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]]. He quickly grasps the nature of Otto Hightower's plan to blame Rhaenyra for the killing is to vilify her as a kinslayer and child-killer to counter the rumors circulating in King's Landing that she should have been crowned Queen following Viserys's death, rather than the increasingly unpopular Aegon II.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Following the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]], Orwyle proposes sending a raven to [[Riverrun]], ordering Lord Grover Tully to rein in Houses [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken|Bracken]], only for Jasper Wylde to dismiss Grover's ability to control his bannermen. When Jasper and Tyland debate whether to use the military strength of House Hightower or House Lannister to bring the Riverlands to heel, Orwyle argues it would be best to march both armies and catch the rebellious Rivermen between them, only for Tyland to mock Orwyle's lack of experience in military matters, sarcastically asking which link in his maester's chain signifies mastery of warcraft until Alicent shouts at them to cease squabbling.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Some days later, Orwyle comes to Alicent's chambers with a jar of [[moon tea]] he brewed at her request (Alicent having told him it was for a girl in her service). Orwyle warns Alicent that the tea is known to disagree with the gut, for which she thanks him. Acknowledging Orwyle as a loyal servant of the crown, Alicent asks the Grand Maester if Viserys ever discussed a wish for Aegon to succeed him: Orwyle demurs, admitting Viserys never broached the subject with him.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Following the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]], Orwyle and his acolytes tend to the horrifically injured King Aegon in the king's chambers upon his return to King's Landing. Orwyle confirms Aegon is still alive when questioned by Alicent, but admits he cannot say whether or not Aegon will survive. He then requests Alicent leave, insisting the next few hours will be critical to the king's survival. As his acolytes apply medicinal poultices and set broken bones, Orwyle cuts away the pieces of Aegon's armour that have become fused to his flesh by dragonfire. Orwyle later reports to the Green Council that he also fears King Aegon has suffered internal injuries; he admits when Alicent asks that Aegon has not reawoken and fears he might never, concluding the king's fate now lies in the hands of the gods. In the ensuing debate over who should rule as regent in Aegon's stead, Orwyle is the only member of the Council to support Alicent's candidacy, citing her past experience and skill in a similar role during King Viserys's illness, but the rest of the Council vote in favor of Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

At a meeting of the Green Council, when Prince Aemond proposes seeking military aid from the [[Triarchy]] to break the Velaryon fleet's blockade of the Gullet, Alicent asks Orwyle what has happened to their letters to [[House Greyjoy/House of the Dragon|House Greyjoy]]; Orwyle replies that Dalton Greyjoy has ignored all the ravens Orwyle sent to the Iron Islands. Orwyle later interrupts another meeting between Aemond, Lord [[Larys Strong]] and Lord Jasper Wylde to inform them that King Aegon has regained conciousness. When he comes to administer another round of treatment to the King, he is disturbed to find Aemond looming over Aegon's bed, though Aemond leaves after insisting the Grand Maester ensure Aegon is comfortable.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Later that day, Orwyle comes to Aegon's chambers to find the Dowager Queen by her son's bedside. Orwyle assures Alicent that while Aegon sleeps nine of every ten hours, he did open his eyes and speak, offering hope Aegon will recover, though he remains silent when Alicent asks what quality of life her son will have even if he survives. Orwyle adds he has sent letters to [[Oldtown]] and [[Highgarden]] to summon Ser Otto Hightower, but he has not responded, and informs Alicent that war has broken out in the [[Reach]], led by [[House Beesbury]], who have risen in revolt over Lord Lyman's killing.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==Personality==
Orwyle prefers less traditional methods of healing than those of his predecessor.{{Guideref|Grand Maester Orwyle}}

==Behind the scenes==
Orwyle's character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"A scholar and healer for the realm, providing counsel to King Aegon II."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros.

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Orwyle was an [[archmaester]] of [[Noble house|noble]] birth. The [[Conclave]] elected him to succeed Mellos as Grand Maester in 127 AC, and he was known to be a better physician to King Viserys than Mellos was. His account is one of three major sources cited by Archmaester Gyldayn in the latter half of ''Fire & Blood''.

After King Viserys's death, Orwyle attended a meeting of the Small Council, most of them were [[greens]]. According to Munkun, Orwyle softly protested when [[Otto Hightower]] spoke of crowning Aegon, but Mushroom and Septon Eustace insist the protest was made by [[Lyman Beesbury]].

Following Aegon II's coronation and Rhaenyra's subsequent coronation on Dragonstone, Orwyle suggested he take peace terms to Rhaenyra, seeking to resolve the conflict peacefully. Aegon did not like the idea, accused Orwyle of disloyalty, and threatened to imprison him, but Alicent and Helaena were in favor of Orwyle's idea. Thus he (in the show - Otto Hightower) was sent to Dragonstone, under a peace banner, escorted by [[Arryk Cargyll]], [[Gwayne Hightower]], a score of scribes, and septons (amongst them Eustace). 

Rhaenyra listened to the terms Aegon had offered, then asked Orwyle if he remembered whom her father had named as his heir and successor. When Orwyle admitted it was her, Rhaenyra demanded to know why he served her half-brother. According to Munkun, Orwyle cited the Andal law of a son inheriting before a daughter and the [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council of 101 AC]]; Mushroom claims he stammered and wet his pants. Either way, his response only enraged Rhaenyra, who angrily told him "You are no Grand Maester, and you bring only shame and dishonor to that chain you wear." Her knights forced a protesting Orwyle to his knees and stripped him of his chain of office, which Rhaenyra bestowed upon Maester [[Gerardys]]. She then expelled Orwyle and his retinue from Dragonstone, saying "Tell my half-brother that I will have my throne, or I will have his head."
