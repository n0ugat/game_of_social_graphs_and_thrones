{{Quote|Tyland is... frightfully dull, gods love him.|Jason Lannister on his brother|Second of His Name}}
Ser '''Tyland Lannister''' is a [[knight]] of [[House Lannister]], and the younger twin of Lord [[Jason Lannister]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Tyland is the son of Lady [[Ceira Lannister]] and younger identical twin of Jason Lannister. After [[Corlys Velaryon]] leaves to fight in the [[War for the Stepstones]], Ser Tyland succeeds him as [[Master of Ships]].{{Ref|HOTD103}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Tyland participates in the royal hunt in the [[Kingswood]] on Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s second [[nameday]]. Before the hunt, he urges [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys]] to take action in the [[Stepstones]], warning that the [[Triarchy]] is winning the war. Viserys, who does not wish to be bothered with political matters on his son's nameday, ignores his counsel.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

[[File:Tyland Lannister.png|thumb|left|200px|Ser Tyland counsels King Viserys over the Stepstones.]]
After the War for the Stepstones, as Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] grows politically distant from the royal court, Tyland quips in a small council meeting that the realm has "traded a crabfeeder for a seasnake."{{Ref|HOTD104}} He also attends attends Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s wedding to [[Laenor Velaryon]].{{Ref|HOTD105}}

In the following years, Tyland continues to serve as Master of Ships on Viserys's council. Tyland drives a council meeting, bringing up the matters that require the Crown's attention, such as a border dispute between the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]] and [[House Bracken|Brackens]], as well as the [[Triarchy]]'s new alliance with [[House Martell]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Six years later, news reaches the capital that Corlys Velaryon has suffered a grave wound in battle, and the succession of [[Driftmark]] is brought to the Crown's attention as Ser [[Vaemond Velaryon]] argues that he should be chosen as the Sea Snake's heir, in a dispute that also involves the contentious issue regarding the legitimacy of [[Lucerys Velaryon]]'s birth. During a small council meeting discussing the matter, Tyland casts doubts on Lucerys's abilities as a potential commander of the [[Velaryon fleet]], reminding the court he has been raised away from Driftmark.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

After the death of King Viserys, [[Otto Hightower]] calls an emergency meeting of the small council to discuss the crown's succession. Tyland jokingly asks if [[Dorne]] has been invaded due to the urgency. Upon learning of the king's passing and his alleged final wish for his son Aegon succeed him, however, Tyland springs into action, remarking on how they have Viserys's blessing on their long-laid plans to crown Aegon over Rhaenyra. Tyland and Otto resume their discussion on matters of interest regarding Aegon's crowning, as Otto mentions the need to replace two captains of the [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|City Watch]] who are still loyal to [[Daemon Targaryen]]. Upon Otto's asking, Tyland informs the council that the treasury is in their control, and that the gold will be divided for safekeeping.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[Lyman Beesbury]], shocked at the revelation that Otto, Tyland, [[Jasper Wylde]], and Grand Maester [[Orwyle]] have been scheming to crown Aegon, calls Aegon an "imposter" and reminds them that hundreds of lords and landed knights had sworn fealty to Rhaenyra. Tyland retorts that their oath had been sworn some twenty years ago, and that most of those lords were now dead. As the situation deescalates, Tyland notes that [[Storm's End]] is a concern, as the loyalty of Lord [[Borros Baratheon]] cannot be assumed. Tyland points out that his four unmarried daughters provides them an opportunity for potential negotiations.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:ASonForASon-TylandandJaehaerys.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ser Tyland bickers with the four year old Prince Jaehaerys.]]
Following the outbreak of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Ser Tyland remains on King Aegon's Green Council, albeit in the position of [[Master of Coin]]. He relays the news that his twin brother, Lord Jason, has called the banners of the [[Westerlands]], and is amassing his levies at the [[Golden Tooth]].  When the subject of the [[Velaryon fleet]]'s [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]] of the [[Gullet]], Tyland insists that the navies of Houses [[House Lannister/House of the Dragon|Lannister]] and [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightower]] will have to be reinforced to have a chance at breaking the blockade. Tyland grows irate at the presence of the infant Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] at the Small Council, who pesters him, and is chastised by the King, who instructs him to act as the "Royal Steed" for the young heir. Tyland is spared this humiliation by Queen Alicent, who steers the attention of the Council back to the matter at hand.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 1: "[[A Son for a Son]]" (2024).</ref>

At a hastily convened session of the Council following the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murder of Prince Jaehaerys]], when King Aegon rages as to what his councillors were doing while their king was threatened, Tyland blithely asks if Aegon himself actually was threatened. A furious Aegon knocks Tyland's wine cup from his hand and bellows that he could easily have been the assassins' target. Tyland is also taken aback when Ser [[Otto Hightower]] indicates his willingness to blame Rhaenyra for the murder.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 2: "[[Rhaenyra the Cruel]]" (2024).</ref>

At a session of the Small Council following the dismissal of Otto Hightower and the appointment of Criston Cole as [[Hand of the King]], during discussion of the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]], Tyland contradicts King Aegon's satisfied mood at the death of Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]], a Black loyalist, by pointing out the heavy casualties sustained by both sides make it difficult to call the battle a victory for their cause. With the [[Riverlands]] openly at war, King Aegon demands solutions; Tyland counters Lord [[Jasper Wylde]]'s proposal to order Lord [[Ormund Hightower]] to march his army into the Riverlands, as it will take months for them to muster. He informs Aegon his brother Jason is mustering the armies of the Westerlands at Casterly Rock, a force that will be ready to march in weeks. When [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] argues it would be better to trap the rebellious Rivermen between the armies of the Reach and Westerlands, Tyland laughes and mocks the Grand Maester for presuming to speak on military matters, sarcastically asking which link in his maester's chain signifies mastery of warcraft until Dowager Queen [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] shouts at them to cease squabbling.  Ser [[Criston Cole]] announces his intention to march through the Crownlands, suppress the Black-loyal houses there and march their levies through the Riverlands to seize control of Harrenhal.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 3: "[[The Burning Mill]]" (2024).</ref> 

Following the Rook's Rest, Alicent tries to nominate herself as regent, citing her experience, but the council instead elect Aemond, primarily due to his sex, saying that the choice demonstrates strength. Newly made Prince Regent orders the city gates shut just as masses of citizens try to flee.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 5: "[[Regent (episode)|Regent]]" (2024).</ref>

At a meeting of the Green Council, Aemond, having received Lord [[Jason Lannister|Jason]]'s summons, furiously erupts at Tyland Lannister over his twin brother's arrogant audacity to summon him like a servant. Tyland attempts to defend his brother's decision by reminding Aemond of [[Caraxes]] presence at Harrenhal (against whom the Lannister host would be defenseless should Daemon fly out to intercept them), but Aemond angrily orders Tyland to write back commanding Jason to march into the Riverlands, threatening Caraxes will become the least of Jason's problems if he disobeys.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 5: "[[Regent (episode)|Regent]]" (2024).</ref>
[[File:2x8 Tyland Lannister Still.jpg|thumb|[[Master of Coin]] treats with the High Council of the [[Triarchy]]. ]]
Prince Aemond enlists Tyland to forge an alliance with the [[Triarchy]], in the hope that their fleet will break the blockade (due to the time it will take for their [[House Hightower|Hightower]] and [[House Lannister|Lannister]] navies to reach the [[Narrow Sea]]).<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 6: "[[Smallfolk (episode)|Smallfolk]]" (2024)</ref> 
[[File:Tyland and Triarchy Armada.png|thumb|Ser Tyland travels with their Armada.]]He travels to [[Tyrosh]] and successfully forms an alliance with the High Council of the Triarchy. They agree but demand control over the [[Stepstones]]. Additionally, Admiral [[Sharako Lohar]], a [[Warrior women|warrior woman]] referred to as "he," challenges Tyland to a mud-wrestling match before agreeing to sail with him. Tyland wins, earning Lohar's respect, and they prepare to set sail for [[Westeros]] with the Triarchy's fleet. But Sharako declares, that she wants to have children with Tyland.<ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 8: "[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]" (2024).</ref>

==In the books==
Tyland was the younger twin brother of Lord [[Jason Lannister]], the [[Lord of Casterly Rock]], and the [[Master of Ships]] for King Viserys I. As such, Tyland is apparently not a direct ancestor of Tywin Lannister and his children: they seem to descend from his brother Jason. In their youth, both brothers unsuccessfully vied for Rhaenyra's hand in marriage.
