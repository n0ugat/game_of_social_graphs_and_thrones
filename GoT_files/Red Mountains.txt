The '''Red Mountains'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} are an extensive mountain range in the south of [[Westeros]]. They form a barrier between [[Dorne]] to the south, the [[Stormlands]] to the north, and the [[Reach]] to the west. There are two major passes through the mountains, the [[Prince's Pass]] and the [[Boneway]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Red Mountains are a formidable obstacle to travel between Dorne and the rest of Westeros. The northern face of the range is scattered with castles designed to defend against Dornish raids. This area is called the [[Dornish Marches]] and is part of the Stormlands.

The Red Mountains are noted as being visible from both the Tower of Joy and also [[Summerhall]]. They are so-called for the red-colored stone prevalent in the region.

The [[skirmish at the Tower of Joy]] was the last engagement of [[Robert's Rebellion]], a civil war that divided the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and led to the fall of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] and the rise of the [[House Baratheon|Baratheon dynasty]].
