'''Daisy''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] in [[Littlefinger's brothel]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Daisy is a prostitute originally from [[Haystack Hall]], in the [[Stormlands]].{{Ref|GOT201}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
She is a new prostitute in Littlefinger's brothel. She is learning about the brothel from [[Ros]], impressed by the upmarket decor, and thinks that [[Armeca]] is beautiful. She is present when the infant [[Barra]] is killed by [[Janos Slynt]] in front of her mother [[Mhaegen]].{{Ref|GOT201}}

Daisy is sleeping with [[Pycelle]] when he is arrested by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] for espionage. Tyrion pays her for her troubles.{{Ref|GOT203}} Later, after a suggestion from his enforcer [[Bronn]], Tyrion later hires Ros and Daisy as a late [[nameday]] present for [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. They wait for him in his chamber. When he arrives Ros wishes him a happy name day and then reaches for his crotch. He flinches and then instructs Ros to touch Daisy. He asks if Ros can hit Daisy and she spanks her gently. Joffrey asks if Tyrion sent them and Ros says that Tyrion chose them himself. Joffrey forces Ros to hit Daisy with his belt, hard enough to make her scream. He hands Ros a stag's head sceptre, and she protests that too much pain will spoil the pleasure. He loads [[Joffrey Baratheon's crossbow|his crossbow]] as Ros warns him that his uncle might find out. He tells Ros that he wants Tyrion to find out, and orders her to take Daisy to Tyrion's chambers to show him what has happened or she will also be beaten. He aims the crossbow at Ros and orders her to begin.{{Ref|GOT204}}

It is unknown if Daisy survived the beating, as she is never seen in the brothel again.

==Behind the scenes==
According to Masie Dee, who is a pornographic actress in real life, when she was initially cast the role was simply named "Nubile Whore" - which is what was posted on her trailer on set - though as her scenes in Season 2 developed the writers gave her the name "Daisy".<ref>[http://masiedeehasablog.blogspot.com/2012/04/game-of-thrones-beating.html?zx=9b74a15c18f9e800 Masie Dee's blog] (caution, NSFW).</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character of this name. When Tyrion arrests Pycelle, he is in bed with a maid, but she is never named.
