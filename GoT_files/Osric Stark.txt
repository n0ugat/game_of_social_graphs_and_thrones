{{Quote|Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of ten?|[[Samwell Tarly]] researches past Lords Commander|The House of Black and White}}
'''Osric Stark''' was a member of [[House Stark]] and later the [[Night's Watch]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Osric was a younger brother of the [[King in the North]]. He was elected [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]] at the age of ten, angering his opponent [[Mors Umber]], who accused that the king had intervened to support his brother. When Mors relented, Osric appointed him [[First Ranger]]. He continued to serve as Lord Commander for sixty years, after which he was succeeded by [[Robert of Oxbridge]].<ref>[[:File:5x2 Night's Watch Book.jpg]]</ref>

[[Osric's Hill]], near [[Craster's Keep]], may have been named after him.{{Ref|GOT407}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Samwell Tarly]], knowing that a [[Elections#Night's Watch|choosing]] will be occurring soon, decides to read about the history of past Lords Commander. He is amazed that Osric was chosen at such a young age.{{Ref|GOT502}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Osric Stark was elected Lord Commander of the Night's Watch at age ten, four hundred years before [[Aegon's Conquest]], though he ultimately served as Lord Commander for sixty years.

Samwell Tarly specifically brings up the example of Osric Stark to point out that in the centuries-long history of the Night's Watch, boys younger than Jon Snow (who is around 16 years old at that point) have been elected as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
