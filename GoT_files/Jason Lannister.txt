{{Quote|That man's pride has pride.|King Viserys I Targaryen on Jason Lannister|Second of His Name}}
Lord '''Jason Lannister''' is the head of [[House Lannister/House of the Dragon|House Lannister]], [[Lord of Casterly Rock]], and [[Warden of the West]] during the reigns of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]] and [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Jason is the son of Lady [[Ceira Lannister]] and identical twin of Ser [[Tyland Lannister]]. He is the head of House Lannister during the reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD103}} Although he is entitled the titles "[[Lord of Casterly Rock]] and [[Warden of the West]]," he instead is styled as [[Lord Paramount of the West]] and [[Master of Casterly Rock]].{{Ref|HOTD105}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:WLTW Lynesse, Hobert, Tyland & Jason.png|thumb|Jason and [[Tyland Lannister|Tyland]] attend the Royal wedding.]]
Jason is part of the royal hunt in the [[Kingswood]] for Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]]'s second [[nameday]]. He vies for [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s hand, which Viserys hopes she will accept to arrange a marriage pact, but Rhaenyra rejects him. Jason later presents Viserys with the spear he uses to kill the hart. When Jason questions the succession, Viserys reminds him that it is his duty to inform him of any "rebellion" against him. Jason and his brother later sit alongside Lord [[Hobert Hightower]] when they witness the bloody Rhaenyra return to camp.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

Jason later attends the wedding of Rhaenyra and Ser [[Laenor Velaryon]] with his brother. He congratulates Viserys on the marriage, and asks where Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] is. When Viserys informs him she is still getting prepared, he jests that men wage war because women would not make it in time for battle. Rhaenyra slyly tells Jason that his presence is always appreciated.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

When the [[Dance of the Dragons]] starts, Prince [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] says that the [[Blacks]] cannot count on the support of the Lannisters due to Tyland sitting on the [[Green Council]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Following the outbreak of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Lord Jason calls his banners and begins amassing the armies of the [[Westerlands]] at the [[Golden Tooth]]. His twin, Ser [[Tyland Lannister|Tyland]], relays this news to the [[Green Council]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Jason brings with him a thousand [[knight]]s, seven thousand archers and [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], as well as two caged male [[Lion|lions]]. Jason intends to stay at the Golden Tooth after commanding Humfrey to send a [[raven]] to inform Ser Tyland that they will be ready to march to [[Harrenhal]] as soon as Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] joins them with [[Vhagar]].{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Lord Jason, Lord Humfrey, and their army march across the [[Riverlands]] as they prepare to face [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]]'s army at Harrenhal.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Behind the scenes==
On September 24, 2021, [[HBO]] announced that [[Jefferson Hall]] had been cast in the dual role of twins Tyland and Jason Lannister for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. Jason's character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] reads as follows:
:''"The Lord of Casterly Rock and twin to Ser Tyland Lannister."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

His character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"The haughty Lord of Casterly Rock and twin to Ser Tyland Lannister."''{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros.

==In the books==
According to ''[[Fire & Blood]]'' and ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Lord Jason Lannister was the twin brother of Ser [[Tyland Lannister]], and both vied for the hand of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] in their youth in 112 AC without success.

In the books, Jason (or any member of House Lannister, for that matter) never uses the titles "[[Lord Paramount of the West]]" or "[[Master of Casterly Rock]]". When House Lannister bent the knee to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], he named them [[Warden of the West|Wardens of the West]]. The title of [[Lord Paramount]] is given to the [[Great House]]s who rule over their constituent regions (for example, [[House Tully]] are [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|Lords Paramount of the Trident]] and [[House Baratheon]] are [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands|Lords Paramount of the Stormlands]]), to signify that they stand paramount over the other vassal houses beneath them. The Lannisters, like the [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[House Arryn|Arryns]], do not typically use the title Lord Paramount, since it is more or less synonymous with [[Warden]]. It is possible that, in the show, Jason prefers to use a different style of address, although it would be unconventional. It is equally possible that the titles are an unintentional mistake, conflating "Warden of the West" and "Lord Paramount" into a singular title.

Similarly, "Master of Casterly Rock" is an invention of the TV series. "Masterly" houses, such as [[House Glover]], [[House Tallhart]], and [[House Harlaw]], do exist. They are of unclear hierarchy in Westerosi nobility, although they appear to stand above landed [[knight]]s but below full lords. It would be unlikely for the head of House Lannister, the ruling Great House of the Westerlands, to use a masterly title.
