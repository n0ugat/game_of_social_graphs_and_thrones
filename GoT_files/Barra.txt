{{Quote|She looks like him, don't she, m'lord?|[[Mhaegen]] to [[Eddard Stark]] about how Barra resembles her father, [[Robert Baratheon]].|The Wolf and the Lion}}
'''Barra''' was the [[bastard]] daughter of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon|Robert I Baratheon]] and [[Mhaegen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Barra is an infant, the bastard daughter of King Robert Baratheon and Mhaegen, a prostitute working for [[Petyr Baelish]] in [[King's Landing]]. Barra lives with Mhaegen in one of his [[Littlefinger's brothel|brothels]]. Her name may be a reference to her father's noble House, Baratheon.{{Ref|GOT105}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Littlefinger brings [[Eddard Stark]] to see Mhaegen at his brothel. She tells him that Barra is Robert's daughter, one of his many bastards.{{Ref|GOT105}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
During a [[Massacre in King's Landing|purge]] of the late King Robert's bastard children carried out by the [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]], the brothel is stormed, and both Mhaegen and Barra are brought outside. [[Janos Slynt]] orders Barra killed, but his men cannot go through with it, prompting Slynt to kill Barra himself before the eyes of her mother and several prostitutes, including [[Ros]].{{Ref|GOT201}} 

When Ros tells Littlefinger she is upset for Barra's death, he reacts very indifferently and insensitively, commenting that was "poorly handled".{{Ref|GOT202}}

When news of Barra's death (as well as her killer's other actions) reaches the acting [[Hand of the King]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], he has Janos [[Exile|exiled]] to the [[Wall]].{{Ref|GOT202}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Tyrion takes [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] to Littlefinger's brothel. Littlefinger comments "This is the safest place in the city"; Tyrion dryly responds "Not for bastards," presumably referring to Barra's death.{{Ref|GOT303}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Barra and all her other half-siblings who were killed are eventually given a small justice, when Janos Slynt is beheaded by [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jon Snow]].{{Ref|GOT503}}

==Family==
{{Baratheon tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Barra is identified as an infant with thin, dark hair. Her mother is 15 years old and her name is never mentioned. When Eddard sees Barra, he thinks of how much she resembles her half-sister Mya Stone, the eldest of Robert's bastards (whom Robert fathered at a young age when he and Eddard were fostered by [[Jon Arryn]] at the Eyrie).{{Bookref|AGOT|39}} Mya wasn't included in the TV series.

The brothel where Barra lives is not owned by Littlefinger but by Chataya, a tall and elegant black-skinned woman from the Summer Islands.

Following the [[Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel|bloody brawl with Jaime]], [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] accuses Eddard of being drunk after a night of debauchery in the brothel. Eddard tells Robert he had only gone there to see the newborn, Barra. Robert is quite embarrassed to hear that.{{Bookref|AGOT|39}} However, by telling Robert why he was at the brothel, Ned also makes Cersei aware of the newborn's existence and location (though Cersei could also have been informed about Barra from her spies, so it is uncertain if Ned indirectly caused the newborn's death). 

When a dying Robert makes Eddard swear that he will protect and be a second father to his children, it is Barra, [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], and Mya Stone whom Eddard thinks of when he takes the oath.{{Bookref|AGOT|47}}

Afterwards, Barra is ordered to be killed - though in the books, no mention is made that any other bastard children of Robert are also killed (Littlefinger claims that Cersei has had two of Robert's bastards secretly murdered in the past). It is one of the gold cloaks, Allar Deem, instead of Janos Slynt himself, who kills Barra, and her mother as well when she tries to protect her daughter. When Slynt is made [[Lord of Harrenhal]], he recommends Allar Deem to replace him as commander of the Gold Cloaks. However, Tyrion orders that Deem be sent to the Wall with Slynt. Tyrion also sends the captain of the ship that is taking them there a message that if a wave washes Deem overboard it would not be amiss.{{Bookref|ACOK|8}}

When Tyrion discusses Barra's death with [[Varys]], Varys says, looking grief-stricken "There was [[Gendry Baratheon|another bastard]], a boy, older. I took steps to see him removed from harm's way... but I confess, I never dreamed the babe would be at risk. A baseborn girl, less than a year old, with a whore for a mother. What threat could she pose?". Tyrion answers bitterly "She was Robert's. That was enough for Cersei, it would seem".{{Bookref|ACOK|8}} While Tyrion genuinely grieves for Barra, it is unclear if Varys is really sorry for her. His excuse for not acting to save Barra is questionable, given that everyone knows the Lannisters and [[Gregor Clegane|their henchmen]] are not above killing [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|children]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|newborns]]. He could have saved Barra, either by hiding or switching her with another baby, the same way he saved many years before [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|another baby of royal origin]].{{Bookref|ADWD|22}} Interestingly, in both cases Varys acted to save the male descendant, but not the female descendant; perhaps the reason is that according to the Westerosi inheritance rules, male offsprings are ahead of female offsprings, so Varys prefered to save the descendant who had a stronger claim (even if he is a bastard).
