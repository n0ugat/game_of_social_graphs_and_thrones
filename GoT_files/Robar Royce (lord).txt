'''Robar Royce''' was the [[Lord of Runestone]] and head of [[House Royce]]. He is the great-grandfather of [[Yohn Royce]].

==Biography==
Robar Royce was the Lord of Runestone about a century prior to the [[War of the Five Kings]]. He married [[Diana Royce]], who bore him several sons, the oldest two being [[Maynard Royce]], who inherited [[Runestone]] after his father's death, and [[Donal Royce]].<ref name="s1prop">''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' prop from Season 1</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Robar Royce is mentioned in the section on House Royce in the Season 1 prop for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. The section on House Royce never appears on-screen in the TV series, as its planned appearance, where [[Eddard Stark]] would have read from it, was cut.

==In the books==
Robar Royce is referenced only in the TV adaptation of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and has no corresponding counterpart in the books.
