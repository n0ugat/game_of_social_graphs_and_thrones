Lord '''Amos Bracken''' is the head of [[House Bracken]] and Lord of the [[Stone Hedge]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].<ref>https://twitter.com/RedanianIntel/status/1716941997888733601</ref>

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Amos declares for King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] at the start of the Dance of the Dragons. His nephew [[Aeron Bracken]] antagonizes [[Davos Blackwood]] at the borders of Bracken and Blackwood land, setting off the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}
[[File:House Bracken calvary.png|thumb|House Bracken calvary.]]
[[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]], assisting [[Willem Blackwood]] confronts Amos astride [[Caraxes]], demanding Amos renounce his allegiance to Aegon and declare for him, or he will destroy House Bracken. Amos rebuffs the threat, insulting Willem and his late brother, Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]], who perished at the Burning Mill, and departs. In retaliation, Daemon unofficially gives Willem leave to use terror tactics on Bracken lands to force Amos's capitulation. After a protracted terror campaign against his smallfolk by Blackwood forces, Amos bends the knee to Daemon.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Amos and his son [[Raylon Bracken|Raylon]] travel to [[Harrenhal]] and witness the execution of Willem Blackwood.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Family==
{{Bracken tree}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Ser Amos Bracken was a son of Lord [[Humfrey Bracken]]. He was not the Lord of the Stone Hedge as his father was still alive during the Dance.{{Bookref|F&B|15}}

In "[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]," the fourth episode of the [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|first season]], [[Jerrel Bracken]] fights and is killed by [[Willem Blackwood]] during [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s tour to find a suitable husband. This scene is loosely based on a fight between Amos Bracken and [[Samwell Blackwood]], in which Amos won but no one was killed.{{Bookref|F&B|12}}

At the outbreak of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Amos's father, Lord Humfrey, dispatched him to invade the lands of [[House Blackwood]], who had declared for Rhaenyra and started raiding Bracken lands. At the [[Battle at the Burning Mill|Battle of the Burning Mill]], Amos killed Samwell Blackwood in single combat, only to die moments later when an arrow was shot through his head; the arrow was allegedly shot by Samwell's sister Alysanne "Black Aly" Blackwood, but this detail could be mere a family legend.{{Bookref|F&B|15}}
