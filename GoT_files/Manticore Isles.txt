The '''Manticore Isles'''<ref name="Map">[[:File:HotD Far East Map.jpg]]</ref> are a group of islands in the [[Jade Sea]], off the southern coast of [[Essos]]. The islands of [[Leng]] and [[Marahai]] are to the north and west, respectively. East of the Manticore Isles are [[Asshai]] and the [[Shadow Lands]].

==In the books==
In ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' and ''The World of Ice and Fire'', little is known about the Manticore Isles other than their location, and that they are named for the [[manticore]]s that are said to be populous there.
