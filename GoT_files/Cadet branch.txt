A '''cadet branch''' is a [[noble house]] founded by a cadet (legitimate younger son) of another house.

They are usually created when a younger member of a noble house, who is not the current heir of the family seat, is granted lands and titles of his own. [[Bastard]]s, if legitimized, or trueborn descendants of legitimized bastards, when granted lands and titles of their own, also found cadet branches.

Larger and wealthier noble houses such as the Lannisters or Tyrells may have numerous younger cousins, but these are all part of the main house - albeit far down in the line of succession. When younger children or cousins form their own cadet branch, they become head of this new house, though the cadet branch is not considered as prestigious as the main line.

Strictly speaking, a "cadet branch" consists of only male-line descendants, in an unbroken chain from father to son - in which case the founding member was a younger son of another noble house. The inheritance systems in the Seven Kingdoms do not put as much value on descent through the female line. New houses have been formed from the female-line younger descendants of other houses, but their lineage is considered inferior compared to cadet branches who can claim male-line descent.

==Known cadet branches==
* [[House Blackfyre]], founded by [[Daemon Blackfyre]], a legitimized [[bastard]] son of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon&nbsp;IV Targaryen]]. The house became extinct after being defeated in [[Blackfyre Rebellion|numerous]] [[War of the Ninepenny Kings|rebellions]] attempting to claim the [[Iron Throne]].
* [[House Karstark]] of [[Karhold]], formerly House Stark of Karl's Hold. Founded by [[Karlon Stark]], a younger son of [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. Over time, Karl's Hold came to be called Karhold, and the Starks residing there became the Karstarks.
* [[House Baratheon of King's Landing]]. Founded by [[Robert Baratheon]] after taking [[King's Landing]] at the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. It is special in that it was founded by the lord of House Baratheon rather than a younger son. It unofficially dies out with Robert, and is taken over by [[House Lannister]] as a proxy House, as his three children [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] are actually bastards fathered by [[Jaime Lannister]].
* [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone]]. Founded by [[Stannis Baratheon]] when he is given [[Dragonstone]] after Robert's Rebellion.
**Given that Robert secretly had no trueborn heirs, and his youngest brother Renly had no issue, following Robert and Renly's deaths this branch technically became the ''de facto'' "House Baratheon" - particularly because Stannis is Robert's younger brother, not a distantly removed relative. Nonetheless the Lannisters continue to insist that Cersei's children are Robert's heirs.
