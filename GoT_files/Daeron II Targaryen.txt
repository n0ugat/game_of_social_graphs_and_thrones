King '''Daeron II Targaryen''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Dāeron II Targārien''}} also called '''Daeron the Good''', is the twelfth [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] to rule the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He is known for peacefully bringing [[Dorne]] into the realm.

==Biography==
===Background===
Daeron is the son of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] and Queen [[Naerys Targaryen]], born in [[159 AC]].{{Dateref|Daeron II Targaryen}} He has a sister, Princess [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys]]. He also has several half-siblings, including [[Daemon Blackfyre]], [[Brynden Rivers]], [[Aegor Rivers]], and [[Shiera Seastar]].{{Cite}}

Daeron's objection to his father's plan to invade [[Dorne]] supposedly prompted the king to incite Ser [[Morgil Hastwyck]] to spread a rumor that Daeron was the bastard son of Prince [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]] and Queen Naerys. This, along with the king's deathbed [[legitimization]] of Daemon Blackfyre, became a major justification for the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].{{Ref|H&L803}}

When he was twenty years old, he married [[Myriah Martell|Myriah]] of [[House Martell]] at [[Sunspear]]. With her, he fathered four sons - [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor]], [[Aerys Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Aerys]], [[Rhaegel Targaryen|Rhaegel]], and [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]].{{Ref|GOT104}}

During his reign, his half-brother Daemon rebelled against his rule to claim the Iron Throne for himself.{{Cite}}

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daeron II was a dignified man. He had a kind thoughtful face. He was round-shouldered, with thin legs and a small pot belly. His face has a certain quiet strength, though, and his eyes are clear and full of resolve. He wore his father's elaborate dragon Crown. On his coinage, he was depicted as clean-shaven. He was not a warrior by any means, but a cultured, scholarly man who kept company with maesters and other learned men.

After the failed Conquest of Dorne, Daeron's uncle King Baelor the Blessed arranged the marriage of Daeron to Princess Myriah Martell of Dorne as part of a dual marriage pact between the two kingdoms, thus bringing peace to the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He also officiated at the wedding ceremony. Princess Myriah brought many of her native manners and customs with her, and many noble Dornishmen and women flocked to his court, all serving to give life in the [[Red Keep]] a foreign flavor, and alienating many of Daeron's nobles and courtiers. In 170AL they had their first son, whom they named Baelor in honor of Baelor the Blessed. Daeron founded a new castle at Summerhall, in the Dornish Marches, roughly where Dorne, the [[Reach]], and the [[Stormlands]] come together.

Late in Aegon IV's reign, it was whispered that his father had come to believe that Daeron was not his son, but the product of an illegitimate union between his wife Naerys and their brother, Aemon, and was planning to disinherit Daeron in favor of Daemon Blackfyre. Others counter that Aegon IV ''himself'' started this rumor, because he was disgusted that his trueborn son Daeron was an intelligent and scholarly man, and he simply wished he wasn't really his son. As this theory goes, Aegon IV had became so impressed with his bastard son Daemon Blackfyre, who was a consummate warrior and personally charismatic (though he had no experience at politics), that he increasingly wanted to name Daemon as his official heir. Despite all the taunts, japes and disparities he heaped upon his son, Aegon never formally disowned Daeron. Accounts differ as to why, but the most likely explanation is that Aegon feared a civil war if he did so, as many lords who had grown sick of Aegon's corruption and depravity would fight to defend Daeron's rights (the Martells chief among them).

Daeron ascended to the throne, however, following Aegon IV's sudden illness and death, following his ascension he wore his father's elaborate dragon crown to legitimize his claim, and gave Daemon lands in the Crownlands to build a castle to quench his claim to the Iron Throne. Nevertheless, several military-minded lords gathered around Daemon and supported his claim to the Iron Throne, causing the Blackfyre Rebellion.
