{{Quote|Lord Baratheon drank down a knight of skulls and kisses in a wine cup war.|[[Meera Reed]]|The Great Tourney at Harrenhal}}
Ser '''Richard Lonmouth'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was present at the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]].

==Biography==
Ser Richard was present at the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]] in the [[Year of the False Spring]]. [[Robert Baratheon]] drank him down in a drinking game.{{Ref|H&L605}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Richard Lonmouth is briefly mentioned a few times: according to [[Barristan Selmy]], he was a close personal friend and [[squire]] of Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], alongside Myles Mooton; later they were both [[Knighthood|knighted]] by Rhaegar, and remained his close companions.

Meera Reed tells [[Bran Stark|Bran]] that at the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]], the [[Robert Baratheon|storm lord]] played a drinking game with "the knight of skulls and kisses" (who is presumed to be Richard Lonmouth), in which Robert won. Following the amazing performance of the mysterious [[Knight of the Laughing Tree]], they promised King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] that they would unmask him, but never did, since he disappeared the next morning.
