==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Harrion Karstark is the eldest son of Lord Rickard. He joins his father and brothers in the War of the Five Kings.

Harrion takes part in the [[battle on the Green Fork]] and taken as a hostage; his brothers Torrhen and Eddard, who served at Robb's personal bodyguard, are the ones whom Jaime kills at the battle in the Whispering Wood. When Jaime realizes that his army is lost, he makes a final push to single-handedly carve his way through the Northern army in an attempt to kill Robb in single combat. Jaime manages to reach Robb's personal bodyguard and kill several of them, including Eddard and Torrhen, before being knocked unconscious.

Harrion is kept hostage at Harrenhal until the northern prisoners are released by [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Jaqen H'ghar]] and the Brave Companions turn on Ser [[Amory Lorch]] to deliver the castle to [[Roose Bolton]]. Later Roose (who, at this point, secretly collaborates with the Lannisters) sends him, Robett Glover, and Helman Tallhart to take [[Duskendale]]. As Roose has planned, they are ambushed and defeated by a combined Lannister-Tarly force. Harrion is taken captive again and his current whereabouts are unknown.

Following his father's execution, Harrion becomes Lord of Karhold. It is unknown whether Harrion is aware of that and if he is still alive.

Harrion's great-uncle Arnolf, who secretly collaborates with the Boltons, tries to get him killed so that he can take over Karhold: he announces in public that he supports Stannis (intending to stab him in the back while fighting the Boltons), hoping that the Lannisters will execute Harrion as a punishment, then his sister [[Alys Karstark|Alys]] will become the heiress of Karhold. Arnolf plans to force Alys to marry his son Cregan and after she gives birth to his son - they will gain ownership legally of Karhold. Alys, however, finds out about Arnolf's twofold treachery, escapes to Castle Black, and informs Jon what her great-uncle is up to. She has no idea what became of her brother as a result of Arnolf's fake announcement.

Harrion's fate has been left unclear in the novels so far.

Eddard Karstark was apparently switched with his brother Harrion Karstark (or at least, the names were switched) so TV viewers who haven't read the books would not be confused that more than one character named "Eddard" exists, even though [[George R.R. Martin]] made it a point in the books to re-use certain names for minor characters, i.e. to emphasize that "Robert Baratheon" isn't the only person named "Robert" in the entire continent of Westeros. In the television series, Torrhen and Harrion are revealed to have a younger brother, but named "Harald" instead of "Eddard".

In the TV series, Ramsay Snow briefly masquerades as Harrion during one of the mind games that he plays on Theon. This isn't mentioned in the books, as virtually all of Theon's torture takes place off-page, and is only alluded to.
