'''House Vance'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} of [[Wayfarer's Rest]] is a [[Noble house|vassal house]] of the [[Riverlands]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
House Vance is part of [[Daemon Targaryen]]'s army during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are two houses of the name Vance, one of [[Atranta]] and another of Wayfarer's Rest. The sigil of the Vances of Atranta is a quartered white dragon and green towers on black and white. Both branches lord over wider domains and can field greater armies than their overlords of [[House Tully]]. It is unknown if the Vances of Atranta exist in the TV series, as only the sigil of the Wayfarer's Rest Vances has appeared so far.

The name 'Vance' is based on author [[wikipedia:Jack Vance|Jack Vance]], whom [[George R.R. Martin]] greatly admires.
