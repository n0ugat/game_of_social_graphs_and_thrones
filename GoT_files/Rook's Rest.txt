'''Rook's Rest'''{{Ref|GOT310}} is a castle in the [[Crownlands]] which answers directly to the King on the [[Iron Throne]]. It is located north and east of [[King's Landing]] on the north coast of [[Blackwater Bay]], east of [[Duskendale]] but west of [[Crackclaw Point]].

==History==
[[File:OT2 Rook's Rest.png|thumb|The Green army march on Rook's Rest.]]

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
A major [[Battle at Rook's Rest|battle]] is fought at Rook's Rest during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. It ends in the death of [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and [[Meleys]], the severe injury of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] and [[Sunfyre]], and the capture of the castle by Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] helps [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] escape from [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] island, so [[Melisandre]] cannot burn him alive as a human sacrifice, provides him with a small rowing boat and directions. Davos instructs Gendry to row due west for a full day and night, then he will reach Rook's Rest, but should continue on lest Melisandre finds him.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Rook's Rest is the seat of House Staunton. The map in the fourth novel, ''A Feast for Crows'', misspells the name as "Rooks Rest".
