The '''​hammer of waters'''{{Ref|H&L308}} was a powerful [[magic]] used by the [[Children of the Forest]] to fight back against the [[First Men]], at the climax of the [[War of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|centuries-long war between the two races]]. The devastation it caused transformed the [[Neck]] into a collection of bogs and swamps and led to [[Pact|a peace]] that lasted thousands of years.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the hammer of the waters is a [[Westeros]]i legend. The legend says that from [[Moat Cailin]]'s Children's Tower the [[Greenseer|greenseers]] of the Children of the Forest called upon their [[Old Gods|nameless gods]] to send down the "hammer of the waters" to break the lands of Westeros in two in a desperate attempt to stop the onslaught of the First Men. The histories say that the [[crannogmen]] grew close to the children of the forest in the days when the greenseers tried to bring the hammer of the waters down upon the Neck.

Unlike the shattering of the [[Arm of Dorne]], the attempt on the Neck was unsuccessful. The Children only succeeded in flooding the land, creating bogs and swamps. Why the Children's magic failed them is unknown. However, the cataclysm proved the strength of their power and may have proved instrumental in bringing the First Men to agree to the terms of the Pact that ended hostilities between the two races and marked 4,000 years of friendship between the First Men and the Children.
