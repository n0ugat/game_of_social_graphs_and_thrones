'''Lady Forlorn'''{{Ref|H&L415}} is the [[Valyrian steel]] blade of [[House Corbray]].

During the [[coming of the Andals]], the sword was in the possession of the Andal lord [[Qyle Corbray]]. When Corbray was killed by the [[Bronze King]], [[Robar II Royce]], the latter claimed the sword and used it during the [[Battle of the Seven Stars]] to kill a knight he wrongly believed to be Ser [[Artys Arryn]].{{Ref|H&L615}}

Centuries later, it was used by Ser [[Gwayne Corbray]] of the [[Kingsguard]] during the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]] to duel [[Daemon Blackfyre]].{{Ref|H&L411}}

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lady Forlorn is currently in the possession of Ser Lyn Corbray, the eldest brother of Lord Lyonel Corbray, having inherited it for taking it in the [[Battle of the Trident]] after their father, then the Lord Corbray, had been wounded and using it to slay Prince [[Lewyn Martell]]. Lyonel still resents not having inherited the blade even though he inherited all family titles and lands.

House Corbray claimed that Ser Jaime Corbray slew Robar in the Battle of the Seven Stars, allowing them to reclaim the original Lady Forlorn.
