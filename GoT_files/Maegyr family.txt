==Behind the scenes==
During rewrites, Robb Stark's romantic interest began to get an increasingly different backstory than in the novels. [[George R.R. Martin]] himself suggested the name Maegyr as an old Volantene name to accommodate the changes from his source novels.<ref>Ryan, Maureen (September 4, 2012). [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/game-of-thrones-season-3-characters_n_1854918.html 'Game of Thrones' Season 3 Characters And Scoop From Creator George R.R. Martin]. Huffington Post.</ref> Talisa's backstory does not include how, or even if, she is related to the same Maegyr family written about in the novels.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Malaquo Maegyr is one of the [[triarchs of Volantis]], the city's three rulers. Triarchs like Malaquo Maegyr are elected from amongst those noble families who can prove unbroken descent from [[old Valyria]]. Malaquo Maegyr is a "Tiger," from the "Old Bloods" political faction who favor more resource allocation into preparing for war. Fittingly, the sigil next to the onscreen credit for [[Oona Chaplin]] in the opening titles, who portrays [[Talisa Stark]], is two tigers circling one another. Nevertheless, Volantene families do not employ sigils, which is a Westerosi custom.
