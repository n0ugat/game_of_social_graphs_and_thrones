==Narration==
'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''Where the [[North]] has its honor and the South its chivalry, the [[Iron Islands]] has its strength.''

'''Yara Greyjoy''': ''We call ourselves the "[[Ironborn]]," and we are warriors feared throughout the [[Seven Kingdoms]].''

'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''Or so we used to be. Unlike their mainland cousins, the [[First Men]] of the Iron Islands never bowed to the [[Old Gods]].''

'''Yara Greyjoy''': ''Theirs was the [[Drowned God]], who made the Ironborn to reave and sack and write their names in salt, steel, and song, that his enemy, the [[Storm God]], could not wash away.''

''We [[Kingsmoot|raised]] our kings from our own ranks and used beaten foes as thralls to work our mines and farm our land.''

'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''Or as [[Salt wife|salt wives]], if a woman was pretty enough. Such was the [[Old Way]], and while we followed it, we held sway wherever the waves were heard.''

''When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] came demanding fealty, King [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] ruled as far east as the [[Trident]].''

'''Yara Greyjoy''': ''Other kings, like the [[House Stark|Starks]], could kneel, but Harren was Ironborn, and the Ironborn must be beaten. In [[Harrenhal]], he had the mightiest castle in [[Westeros]], and the army to defend it.''

'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''But Aegon did not intend a siege. He mounted [[Balerion|his dragon]] and roasted Harren and all his sons in their tower, and the old way with them.''

''Because of Harren's defiance, Aegon pushed the Ironborn back to our islands and gave the [[Riverlands]] to the [[House Tully|Tullys]]. But he did allow the Ironborn to choose who would lead them.''

'''Yara Greyjoy''': ''[[House Greyjoy]] had always been one of the greatest houses of the Iron Islands. We trace their descent from the [[Age of Heroes]] and the legendary [[Grey King]], who took a [[mermaid]] to wife and made war upon the Storm God for a thousand years.''

'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''Blessed by the Drowned God, the Grey King fought and slew [[Nagga]], the great Sea Dragon, and took her fire for his own.''

'''Yara Greyjoy''': ''This history made our ancestor, [[Vickon Greyjoy]], the natural choice to lead the Ironborn after Aegon's Conquest.''

''For three hundred years, House Greyjoy ruled the Ironborn. We style ourselves [[Lord of the Iron Islands]], [[King of Salt and Rock]], [[Son of the Sea Wind]], [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].''

'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''In truth, we were thralls. Our people still chanted "What is Dead May Never Die," but the Old Way had died.''

'''Yara Greyjoy''': ''Until the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] followed their [[dragon]]s into the grave, and our lord father, [[Balon Greyjoy]], rose against the new king, [[Robert Baratheon]].''

''He seized our ancient crown and sent our [[Iron Fleet]] against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] at [[Lannisport]], [[Raid on Lannisport|burning]] all of their ships before any could lay anchor.''

'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''Though Robert and [[Eddard Stark]] would later [[Siege of Pyke|defeat him]], they understood us no better than Aegon. The Greyjoy sigil is the kraken. What it grasps once, it will never surrender.''

'''Theon and Yara Greyjoy''': ''What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger.''
