In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' he was originally announced as playing Lord [[Rickard Karstark]], first seen in the first season finale, ''[[Fire and Blood]]'', but this appears to have been an error. [[Steven Blount]] played Karstark while McCabe actually played [[Leo Lefford]], one of the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] bannermen in the same episode.
