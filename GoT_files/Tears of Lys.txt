==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the tears of Lys are apparently made in the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Lys]]. It is tasteless and odorless, hence easier to hide. Dissolved in wine or water, it causes extreme sickness in the bowels and belly, and kills very quickly. Not only is it difficult for the intended target to detect, its effects are subtle enough that they are easily mistaken for a very sudden and severe fever. Even upon examination of the corpse, it is difficult to discern if someone has been killed using tears of Lys.
