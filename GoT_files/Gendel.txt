'''Gendel''' was a [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] of the [[Free Folk]].

==Biography==
Gendel and his brother [[Gorne]], who shared the title of King-Beyond-the-Wall with him, led an [[Gendel and Gorne's invasion|invasion]] of the [[North]] but were defeated by the combined efforts of [[House Stark]] and the [[Night's Watch]].{{Ref|H&L212}} Trying to return [[beyond the Wall]] through caves and tunnels deep in the earth they took a wrong turn and were lost. According to legend their descendants are still down there looking for a way out.{{Ref|H&L409}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Gendel was joint [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] with his twin brother [[Gorne]], three thousand years before the [[War of the Five Kings]].

The two brothers gathered the Free Folk and led them through a cave path beneath the [[Wall]] that would later be called "Gorne's Way". Gendel and Gorne's host evaded the Night's Watch, but when they emerged, the [[King in the North]] was awaiting them and attacked them. Gorne slew the King, but the King's son took his crown and slew Gorne. While the battle raged, the [[Night's Watch]] emerged from their castles and took the Free Folk in the rear.

According to Northern tradition, Gendel was also killed in battle, as he was surrounded by all sides: [[House Stark|Starks]] to the south, [[House Umber|Umbers]] to the east and the Watch to the north. However, the Free Folk believe that Gendel survived the battle and, cutting his way through the ranks of the Night's Watch tried to return [[beyond the Wall]] through they same route the wildlings had come through. Gendel did not know the way as well as Gorne, though, and he and his followers got lost trying to find their way out. The Free Folk believe that during the night the sobs of Gendel's children can still be heard and that those who venture into the caves and go too deep will be devoured by them.
