{{Quote|Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city.

'''Exile'''{{Ref|GOT109}} is an act of punishment exacted upon those who have committed crimes against those they serve. Criminals or outlaws can be exiled if they have committed a crime that their lord or king deem heinous. The punishment involves one being sent away from their homes and threatened with imprisonment or execution if they return.<ref name="sokl">"[[The Sack of King's Landing - House Baratheon]]"</ref><ref name="E04">"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref><ref name="E37">"[[Mockingbird]]"</ref><ref name="E38">"[[The Mountain and the Viper]]"</ref><ref name="E60">"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

However, exile can also be a form of solitude or fleeing from a potential threat, as was the case with [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]] after [[Robert's Rebellion]],<ref name="sokl" /> and [[Jorah Mormont]] after he was caught selling poachers into slavery. This tends to be known as "self-exile."<ref name="E04" />

When a citizen from [[Westeros]] is banished, they are usually exiled to either the [[Wall]] or [[Essos]].
