==Narration==
'''Catelyn Stark''': ''"Family. Duty. Honor". Every [[House Tully|Tully]] child learns our words, but [[Catelyn Stark|I]] was a woman before I understood them.''

''Years before, [[Hoster Tully|my father]] had taken to foster the son of a [[War of the Ninepenny Kings|wartime]] [[Lord Baelish|friend]], a minor lord on the [[Fingers]]. The boy had arrived at [[Riverrun|our castle]] as [[Petyr Baelish]]. Due to his home and size, [[Edmure Tully|my brother]] soon named him "Littlefinger."''

''When I came of age, [[Brandon Stark]] of [[Winterfell]] sought and won my hand. To my father, Brandon was heir to the [[North]] and a suitable match for a daughter of House Tully. To me, Brandon was wild and terrifying, never far from laughter or trouble. I loved him with all the fire of a first passion; much, I came to realize, as Petyr loved me.''

''When Petyr heard of my engagement, he challenged Brandon to a duel. Petyr survived only because I begged Brandon not to kill him. I still thought of Petyr as family. Now, I wish I had let him die.''

''Only days before my wedding, when I thought I would be happy forever, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] Brandon's sister, [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]]. Hotblooded as always, Brandon immediately rode for [[King's Landing]] to demand justice, which the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King Aerys Targaryen]] [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|gave him]] in his own twisted fashion.''

''The day the [[raven]] arrived with the news of my Brandon's death, I locked myself in my room and refused to eat for days, until my father reminded me of my duty.''

''I was to marry [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]], Brandon's younger brother, a man whom I had never met, though of whom none spoke ill or spoke anything at all.''

''Our union would cement an alliance of the North, [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], [[Stormlands]], and [[Riverlands]] in [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] against the Mad King. I was Tully. I did my duty. We were married quickly and were spared only one night before he had to return to the field.''

''I spent the war by the window, waiting for a raven to hear if [[Robb Stark|my child]] would grow fatherless or at all. We knew the price of defeat. I scoured the kitchens and washing rooms for any and all gossip.''

''[[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] had won and crushed the Mad King! Robert had lost, but [[Jaime Lannister]] was now king. Robert had almost won, but the Mad King had become a [[dragon]] and burned [[King's Landing]] to ash.''

''At night, I told herself the war would end soon and bring peace: either a victory or the grave.''

''I was wrong. Robert won and my husband avenged his brother and my love. But when he came home to me, he could not meet my eyes. I saw the reason by his side.''

''Many men have bastards, I know, and under the strain of war, any man, no matter how honorable, may forsake his vows for a night of warmth that he may never know again. But Ned Stark was not built like other men. His [[Northmen|northern]] honor would not let him sequester his shame in some distant holdfast. He brought this boy, this "[[Jon Snow]]," [[Winterfell|home]] to raise with his trueborn children. My children.''

''Yet even these bitter memories are sweet now. They are all I have left of my Ned. Our family is broken and scattered, and [[Robb Stark|our son]] must wage a [[War of the Five Kings|war]] for the pieces.''

'' We need to go home. The Starks are of the North, and, like the snows of winter, when they come south, they melt away.''
