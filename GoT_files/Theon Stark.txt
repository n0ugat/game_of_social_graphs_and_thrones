{{Quote|King Theon even sailed his own army to the Andal homeland for vengeance and slew hundreds of Andal warriors. When he returned, he planted their heads on spikes along our coasts. A warning to other would-be conquerors.|[[Sansa Stark]]|Northern Allegiances to House Stark}}
King '''Theon Stark ''' was [[King in the North]] during the [[coming of the Andals]].

==Biography==
During the [[coming of the Andals]], the unified Northern lords under [[House Stark]] were able to keep them out, and King Theon sailed his own fleet to the Andal homeland [[Andalos]] for vengeance. There, he killed hundreds of Andal warriors, and upon returning home, he placed their heads on spikes along the northern coasts as a warning to anyone attempting to conquer the North.{{Ref|H&L609}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, King Theon is depicted in the crypt of Winterfell as gaunt with long hair and a skinny appearance. His appearance as well as the constant state of war during his reign earned him the nickname, the Hungry Wolf. With the aid of [[House Bolton]], he defeated the Andal warlord Argos Sevenstar at the Battle of the Weeping Water. He then sailed across the Narrow Sea with Argos's body displayed on the prow of his ship like a figurehead and burned a score of Andal villages, killing hundreds and displaying the spiked heads of his slain enemies along his coastline to discourage future invaders.

When Harrag Hoare, [[King of the Iron Islands]], invaded the western coast of the North during Theon's reign, he conquered the [[Stony Shore]] and burned the [[Wolfswood]]. His son, Ravos "the Reaper" Hoare, took Bear Island but Theon eventually slew him and expelled the [[ironborn]] as well.

At one point in ''A Dance with Dragons'', [[Theon Greyjoy]] refers to Theon Stark as his namesake.
