Lord '''Leyton Hightower'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the [[Lord of Oldtown]] and head of [[House Hightower]].

==Biography==
Lord Leyton has not descended from the [[Hightower]] in over a decade.{{Ref|H&L312}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lord Leyton holds the titles Lord of the Hightower, [[Voice of Oldtown]], Lord of the Port, [[Defender of the Citadel]], and Beacon of the South. His flagship is called the ''Honor of Oldtown''. He has been [[Marriage|married]] four times and is currently married to Rhea [[House Florent|Florent]]. Among his children are [[Alerie Tyrell|Alerie]], wife of [[Lord of Highgarden|Lord]] [[Mace Tyrell]], and [[Lynesse Hightower (daughter of Leyton)|Lynesse]], former wife of [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Jorah Mormont]].

During a [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Storm's End]], he was unhorsed by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. [[Lord of Casterly Rock|Lord]] [[Tywin Lannister]] once offered his [[dwarf]] son, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], for marriage to one of his daughters, but Lord Leyton felt insulted and rejected the offer.

During the beginning of the [[War of the Five Kings]], Lord Leyton supports [[Renly Baratheon]], but changes sides along with his [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] overlords to support [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. After the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], the [[Small Council]] rewards him with lesser tracts of lands taken from the defeated. 

In ''A Feast for Crows'', after [[Euron Greyjoy]] captures the [[Shield Islands]], [[Willas Tyrell]] sends word from [[Highgarden]] so Leyton can prepare the defenses of [[Oldtown]]. Leyton remains in the Hightower, supposedly reading [[magic]]al texts with his eldest daughter, Malora, while his sons rule in his stead.

In "The Forsaken" sample chapter of the sixth novel ''The Winds of Winter'', it is mentioned that while the [[Redwyne fleet]] sails back from [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] to the [[Arbor]] to fight the [[ironborn]], Lord Leyton sends Oldtown's fleet south of out of Whispering Sound, under the command of his sons, to attack the ironborn fleet in the rear. Euron and his subordinates are aware that soon they will be caught between the two enemy fleets, but they seem unconcerned.
