'''Yaros'''{{Ref|GOT408}} is a small island in [[Slaver's Bay]], located just off the coast southwest from [[Yunkai]], though it is apparently the largest island in Slaver's Bay itself (which is bounded to the west by the large [[Isle of Cedars]]). Yaros lies directly between Yunkai and [[Astapor]].

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Yaros is much the same. The island is located north of Astapor and southwest of Yunkai.
