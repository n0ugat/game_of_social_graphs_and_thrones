==Narration==
'''Viserys Targaryen''': ''The days of the [[Andals]] were numbered. One by one, their so-called kings were bending the knee or facing the wrath of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]]. Aegon of [[Old Valyria]], Aegon, who was "blood of the dragon."''

''After [[Burning of Harrenhal|defeating]] the [[Ironborn|Ironmen]] at [[Harrenhal]] and [[Last Storm|slaying]] the [[Argilac Durrandon|last]] of the [[Storm King]]s, Aegon and his sisters, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]], set their sights on other prizes. The gold mines of the [[Casterly Rock|Rock]] and the fertile lands of the [[Reach]].''

''[[King of the Rock|King]] [[Loren I Lannister|Loren Lannister]] of the [[Westerlands|Rock]] and [[King of the Reach|King]] [[Mern IX Gardener|Mern Gardener]] of the [[Reach]] foolishly thought their combined armies could beat back the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] host.''

''They rode forth together, their proud banners flapping in the wind, and faced off against Aegon in a vast golden field of wheat. The two kings commanded a massive force of nearly sixty thousand and it appeared the day was theirs.''

''Until Aegon unleashed all three of his [[dragon]]s, for the first and only time. Each beast was named after the Valyrian gods of Aegon's forefathers.''

''Visenya rode [[Vhagar]], whose fiery breath could melt armor. Rhaenys rode [[Meraxes]], whose jaws were big enough to swallow a horse whole. The greatest of all was [[Balerion|Balerion the Black Dread]], with fire dark as night and wings so huge, whole towns were covered in shadow when he flew overhead. This magnificent creature was ridden by Aegon himself.''

''Four thousand men were bathed in glorious dragonflame that day, on what came to be known as the [[Field of Fire]]. King Mern was among the dead, and [[House Gardener]] died with him.''

''His [[Steward|stewards]], the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]], surrendered his ancestral stronghold of [[Highgarden]] to Aegon and were appointed [[Lord Paramount of the Reach|Lords Paramount of the Reach]] and [[Warden of the South|Wardens of the South]].''

''When Loren Lannister witnessed Mern's fate, he wisely bent the knee. Aegon spared Loren's life, and the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] were made Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and [[Warden of the West|Wardens of the West]].''

''After his triumph on the Field of Fire, Aegon's conquest was assured. In a short time, the so-called [[Seven Kingdoms]] were melted down in the heat of the dragons' flame and transformed into a [[Iron Throne|single realm]].''

''Aegon would forever be known as Aegon the Conqueror.''
