A concept for a television series of the ''[[World of Westeros]]'' based on the '''Seven Gods''' was considered.

==History==
Following the conclusion of [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]], [[George R.R. Martin]] flew to Los Angeles to pitch two concepts for successor shows to [[HBO]] executives: ''[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms|Dunk and Egg]]'' and ''[[The Dance of the Dragons]]''. HBO passed on ''Dunk and Egg'' and did not want to rely solely on ''The Dance of the Dragons'' to propel the ''[[World of Westeros]]'' franchise. Thus, the network compiled approximately 15 prequel concepts that they considered for development, including one based on the Seven Gods. It, along with ten other concepts, did not make it past the conceptual stage and was never in development.<ref name="THR" />

Instead, HBO moved forward with the following five pitches: [[Carly Wray]]'s (and later [[Bryan Cogman]]'s) ''The Dance of the Dragons''; [[Max Borenstein]]'s [[Doom of Valyria (pitch)|Doom of Valyria pitch]]; [[Brian Helgeland]]'s [[Ten Thousand Ships|Nymeria pitch]]; [[Rand Ravich]] and [[Far Shariat]]'s [[Aegon's Conquest (Rand Ravich/Far Shariat)|Aegon's Conquest pitch]]; and [[Jane Goldman]]'s ''[[Bloodmoon]]'', which was the only one to receive a [[Pilot (Bloodmoon)|pilot]] order.<ref name="THR" />

By 2024, ''Bloodmoon'' was shelved, ''The Dance of the Dragons'' developed into ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' under [[Ryan Condal]],<ref name="THR" /> ''Dunk and Egg'' was ordered by HBO as ''[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', then titled ''A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight'', under [[Ira Parker]],{{Webref|name=Variety |author=Joe Otterson |date=April 12, 2023 |url=https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/game-of-thrones-prequel-series-a-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-hbo-1235578466/ |title=‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Series ‘A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight’ Ordered at HBO |website=Variety |access-date=April 13, 2023 }} and the Nymeria pitch, now ''[[Ten Thousand Ships]]'' under [[Eboni Booth]], is still in development.{{Webref|name=NAB |author=George R.R.
