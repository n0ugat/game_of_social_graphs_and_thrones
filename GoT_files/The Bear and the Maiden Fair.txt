''A bear there was<br />A bear, a bear<br />All black and brown<br />And covered in hair''

''Three boys, a goat<br />And a dancing bear<br />They danced and spun<br />Up to the fair''

''How sweet she was<br />And pure and fair<br />The maid with honey<br />Up in her hair''

''He smelled her all<br />On the summer air<br />The maid with honey<br />Up in her hair''

''From there, to here. From here! To there!''<br />
''All black and brown and covered in hair!''<br />
''He smelled that girl on the summer air!''<br />
''The bear! The bear!''<br />
''The maiden fair!''

''Oh, I'm a maid, and I'm pure and fair!''<br />
''I'll never dance with a hairy bear!''<br />
''I called a knight, but you're a bear!''<br />
''All black and brown and covered in hair!''

''He lifted her high in the air!''<br />
''He sniffed and roared and he smelled her there!''<br />
''She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair!''<br />
''He licked the honey all up in her hair!''

''From there to here. From here! To there!''<br />
''All black and brown and covered in hair!''<br />
''He smelled that girl on the summer air!''<br />
''The bear! The bear!''<br />
''The maiden fair!''

''And the bear, the bear!''<br />
''The maiden fair!''<br />
''And the bear, the bear!''

''She sighed and she squealed and she kicked the air!''<br />
''Then she sang: My bear! My bear so fair!''<br />
''And off they went into the summer air!''<br />
''The bear, the bear,''<br />
''And the maiden fair!''

''From there to here. From here! To there!''<br />
''All black and brown and covered in hair!''<br />
''He smelled that girl on the summer air!''<br />
''The bear! The bear!''<br />
''The maiden fair!''

''And the bear, the bear!''<br />
''The maiden fair!''<br />
''And the bear, the bear!''<br />
''The maiden fair!''<br />
''And the bear, the bear!''

== Behind the scenes ==
The producers of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' enlisted Brooklyn indie rock band [[The Hold Steady]] to record a version of the song, with music composed by [[Ramin Djawadi]].<ref>[http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/03/05/game-of-thrones-hold-steady/ Entertainment Weekly]</ref> Their cover of the song plays during the end credits for episode 3 of Season 3, "[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]".

The Hold Steady were enthusiastic about the project because guitarist Tad Kubler knew [[Peter Dinklage]] (they used to play pool together in Brooklyn) and had become a fan of the show through the association. Producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] received the finished version of the song while working with [[George R.R. Martin]] in Santa Fe, and the three of them drank tequila while listening to the song. The producers were so pleased by the final song that they have offered Kubler a cameo appearance in a future season of the show.<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/game-of-thrones-behind-the-music.html Vulture]</ref>

[[Gary Lightbody]], the lead singer of Northern Irish rock band [[wikipedia:Snow Patrol|Snow Patrol]], sings the song in the episode "Walk of Punishment" itself. In a cameo appearance, he plays a Bolton soldier in [[Locke]]'s group who take [[Jaime Lannister]] and [[Brienne of Tarth]] prisoner.{{Ref|GOT303}}

== In the books ==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" is a somewhat ribald song popular among the smallfolk and the nobility as well. It describes in a humorous tone the story of a hairy bear that, while going to a fair with a band of three boys and a goat, rescues a maiden who was hoping for a [[Knighthood|knight]]. The lyrics used so far in Season 3 of the TV series are slightly rearranged from the version in the books.

===Book version===
''A bear there was, a bear, a bear!''<br />
''All black and brown, and covered with hair!''<br />
''Oh, come, they said, oh come to the fair!''<br />
''The fair? Said he, but I'm a bear!''<br />
''All black, and brown, and covered with hair!''

''And down the road from here to there.''<br />
''From here! To there!''<br />
''Three boys, a goat, and a dancing bear!''<br />
''They danced and spun, all the way to the fair!''<br />

''Oh, sweet she was, and pure, and fair!''<br />
''The maid with honey,''<br />
''In her hair! Her hair!''<br />
''The maid with honey in her hair!''

''He smelled the scent on the summer air!''<br />
''The bear! The bear!''<br />
''All black and brown and covered with hair!''<br />
''He smelled the scent on the summer air!''<br />
''He sniffed and roared and smelled it there!''<br />
''Honey on the summer air!''

''Oh, I'm a maid, and I'm pure and fair!''<br />
''I'll never dance with a hairy bear!''<br />
''A bear! A bear!''<br />
''I'll never dance with a hairy bear!''<br />
''He lifted her high into the air!''<br />
''The bear! The bear!''

''I called for a knight, but you're a bear!''<br />
''A bear! A bear!''<br />
''All black and brown and covered with hair!''<br />
''She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair,''<br />
''But he licked the honey from her hair!''<br />
''Her hair! Her hair!''

''Then she sighed and squealed and kicked the air!''<br />
''My bear! She sang. My bear so fair!''<br />
''And off they went, from here to there,''<br />
''The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair.''
