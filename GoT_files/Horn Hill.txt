'''Horn Hill'''{{Ref|GOT104}} is the seat of [[House Tarly]] in the [[Reach]]. It is located southeast of [[Highgarden]]. With Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] and his son and heir [[Dickon Tarly|Dickon]] having been executed by [[Daenerys Targaryen]], the rightful ruler of Horn Hill would be Lord Tarly's daughter [[Talla Tarly|Talla]].

It should be noted that since Talla has been betrothed to [[Symun Fossoway]], [[House Fossoway]] would possibly take over as the new Lord of Horn Hill.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[Samwell Tarly]] travels to the [[Citadel]] to study about the [[White Walkers]]. Since the Citadel only admits men, he plans to send [[Gilly]] and her baby [[Sam]] to his ancestral home at Horn Hill where his father [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]], mother [[Melessa Tarly|Melessa]], and siblings [[Dickon Tarly|Dickon]] and [[Talla Tarly|Talla]] live.{{Ref|GOT603}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Horn Hill lies a hundred leagues northeast of [[Oldtown]] among the thickly-wooded foothills of the [[Red Mountains]] of [[Dorne]]. There is a pond that lies below the castle.
