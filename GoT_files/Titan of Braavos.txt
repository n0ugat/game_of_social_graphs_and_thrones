The '''Titan of Braavos''',<ref>[[:File:Game of Thrones: Visual Effects – The Titan of Braavos (HBO)]]</ref> or simply the '''Titan''',{{Ref|GOT502}} is a fortress in the shape of a massive statue that guards the harbor entrance to [[Braavos]], one of the [[Free Cities]]. It stands nearly 400 feet tall.<ref>"[[Braavos (short)|Braavos]]"</ref>

As a major landmark, the Titan is often used as a symbol of the city itself. The image of the Titan appears on Braavosi [[Money|coinage]].

The nickname of the Braavosi [[Mercenary|sellsword]] [[Mero]], "the Titan's Bastard," makes reference to the Titan.

The trading galley, the ''[[Titan's Daughter]]'', also bears its name in reference to the Titan as a symbol of its home port.<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Titan of Braavos is a massive stone and bronze statue that guards the entrance into the lagoon where [[Braavos]] is situated. It is the primary line of defense for Braavos and lets out a loud blast whenever a ship approaches the entrance to warn the Arsenal of its coming.

The Titan is listed as one of the nine ''[[Wonders Made by Man]]'' in the eponymous book written by explorer [[Lomas Longstrider]].

The Titan was likely inspired by the real-life [[wikipedia:Colossus_of_Rhodes|Colossus of Rhodes]], an allegedly gigantic statue of the Greek sun god, Helios, that graced the harbor of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea. Listed as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it was destroyed during an earthquake in 226 BCE. Later artistic impressions show the Colossus as straddling the harbor with an upraised arm, much like the Titan, but it is generally accepted that this was a misinterpretation that originated in the medieval period. The actual Colossus probably stood to one side of the harbor in a posture that was structurally sound for its heavy bronze composition.
