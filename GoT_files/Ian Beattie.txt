His father could possibly be credited for bringing alive the student entertainment scene in Belfast during a very dark time in the city's history with The Crescent Bar. Prior to The Crescent there really was nowhere for Queens University students to go where they could be guaranteed a safe night out. His Father (TJ) changed all of that with a run down bar in the city's Sandy Row area where sawdust and soul was served up on a nightly basis.
