{{Quote|A khal who cannot ride is no khal.|Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]|Baelor}}
A '''''khal'''''{{Ref|GOT101}} is a [[Dothraki]] warlord, commanding a ''[[khalasar]]'' or tribe of tens of thousands of warriors and non-combatants. To become ''khal'', a Dothraki warrior must perform tremendous feats of bravery, daring and martial valor, as well as being ruthless and canny enough to avoid the machinations of his enemies and rivals. [[Drogo]] is an exceptional Dothraki ''khal'' for commanding such a large ''khalasar'' at a young age. It is said that if a ''khal'' cannot ride, he cannot lead.
