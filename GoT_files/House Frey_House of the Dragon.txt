'''House Frey''' of the [[Twins]] is a [[noble house]] from the [[Riverlands]] and a vassal of [[House Tully]]. 

Their ancestral seat is known as the Twins for its two identical keeps on both sides of a river linked by a bridge, sometimes called the Stone Bridge. The Twins is one of the primary crossings over the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]], and tolls from bridge crossings have made the Freys quite wealthy fairly quickly, elevating them from obscurity six centuries ago to being one of the most powerful noble houses in the Riverlands - though they are looked down upon by older aristocratic families. The construction of the Twins took the Freys three centuries, and ever since they have grown wealthy by charging the travellers crossing the Twins.

The current head of the house is [[Forrest Frey]].

The [[heraldry]] of House Frey represents their castle-seat of the Twins: it consists of two grey towers linked by a bridge, on a darker grey background, over an escutcheon of blue water. Their [[house words]] are "We Stand Together."

== History ==
House Frey was a noble house in the [[Riverlands]] that had emerged three hundred years before [[Aegon's Conquest]]. Their seat is at the [[Twins]], a castle consisting of two identical towers and a bridge intersecting the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]] river. The Freys grew rich from exacting tolls on travelers crossing the Green Fork. For most of their history, the Freys have been vassals of [[House Tully]], the [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|paramount lords]] of the Trident since the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] conquest.[[File:2x5 Jace and Freys Still.jpg|thumb|Jace and the Freys negotiate. ]]

=== [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]] ===
Lord Forrest and Lady Serena treat with Prince Jacaerys at the Twins. Jace sits at a table with them in the centre of bridge. They take note on Lord [[Grover Tully]]'s declaration for Rhaenyra not having been answered. Jace negotiates that it is treason to not answer Rhaenyra's call to war and that he needs the Twins' passage for the [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|Stark]] army. House Frey does not fear Queen Rhaenyra or Lord Tully's hesitance to join the fray, but they do fear Vhagar. Jace is surprised that they fear Vhagar when Vermax is outside the Twins' walls. He offers his protection to House Frey against any attack from the Greens or his uncle Daemon, who will do as Rhaenyra commands. When the Freys wish to possess Harrenhal, Jace declares that for that they will have to bend the knee to Rhaenyra. The meeting concludes with an agreement and Jace acquiring House Frey to the Blacks.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 5: "[[Regent (episode)|Regent]]" (2024).</ref>
== Military ==
Due to their wealth from river tolls, the Freys command one of the larger armies among the houses of The Riverlands. Their military strength is formidable, allowing them to raise 4,000 soldiers by themselves - almost 10% of the total strength of the Riverlands.

== In the Books ==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Frey controls the Twins, two castles that hold the Crossing, the only bridge over the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]] for hundreds of miles in either direction. House Frey is the northern-most house of the Riverlands, not far south of the loose border with the [[North]], and has a history of enmity with [[House Reed]], who control the marshes of the [[Neck]] to the north of the Twins.

House Frey was a minor house of no notability until they bridged the Green Fork six centuries ago and defending the bridge with two wooden castles. Charging wayfarers for the use of the Crossing, they grew rich and influential, replacing the castles with strong stone keeps. Their growing wealth and influence saw them gain several vassal houses of their own: House Erenford, House Haigh, and House Charlton. Given the relatively recent rise of their House, the Freys are looked down upon by other noble Houses of the Riverlands as uncouth and honorless.

Their military strength is formidable, allowing them to raise 4,000 soldiers by themselves - almost 10% of the total strength of the Riverlands. The [[heraldry]] of House Frey is somewhat different in the books than it is in the TV series. In the books, it is the two towers and bridge of the Twins colored blue, on a silver-grey background. The TV series made the towers stone grey, and over the same dark grey field as in the books, but now above a blue escutcheon which is drawn to resemble the waves of the Green Fork of the Trident. The color change may be because after the blue river was added as an escutcheon at the bottom, it would have been visually confusing to have the castle be the same color as the water. Unfortunately, reversing the colors like this makes it vaguely resemble the reversed colors used in heraldry by [[bastard]] children (though in such cases, without the escutcheon, the entire background field is blue, not just the escutcheon).
