{{Dialogue a-b|Rhaenyra|How goes the Sea Snake?|Corlys|Better than new. We'll rejoin the blockade on the morrow. Let our foes beware, be they Lannister or Greyjoy. But... my ship is no longer the Sea Snake. She was a testament to my own glory. I've given her a new name: the Queen Who Never Was. What I do now, I do for her.|Rhaenyra Targaryen and Corlys Velaryon|The Queen Who Ever Was}}
The '''''Queen Who Never Was''''',{{Ref|HOTD208}} originally called the '''''Sea Snake''''',{{Ref|HOTD208}} is a ship of the [[Velaryon fleet]].

The ''Sea Snake'' is undergoing repairs in [[Spicetown]] after sustaining heavy damage in the [[War for the Stepstones]]. Corlys remarks that it's a marvel she was able to return from the [[Stepstones]] at all.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the ''Sea Snake'' was designed, built, and captained by Corlys Velaryon when he was still a young [[Knighthood|knight]]. It was on this ship that he made his nine Great Voyages, accumulating a bountiful wealth for [[House Velaryon]].
