==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
After releasing [[Theon Greyjoy]] from the [[Dreadfort]], Ramsay informs the [[master torturer]] and the other soldiers of [[House Bolton]] of Theon's "escape". The men chase after Theon and Ramsay follows on Blood. Theon eventually falls from his horse and the master torturer attempts to rape him. Ramsay shoots and kills the Bolton soldiers before they can go through with this.{{Ref|GOT303}}

Ramsay rides on Blood as he tells Theon a false backstory about him growing up on [[Saltcliffe]] and being present on the day that [[Eddard Stark]] took Theon as a [[hostage]] following the failure of the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. Ramsay promises to take Theon to his sister [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] at [[Deepwood Motte]], but instead leads him back to the Dreadfort.{{Ref|GOT304}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Ramsay rides Blood to [[Moat Cailin]] as he leads his men to [[Siege of Moat Cailin|liberate]] it from [[Ironborn]] forces. After they reclaim the fortress, the army rides to the ruins of [[Winterfell]].{{Ref|GOT408}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Blood is a red stallion whose temper matches that of his master. Ramsay makes Theon tend to him like a [[squire]], and Blood often tries to kick Theon.
