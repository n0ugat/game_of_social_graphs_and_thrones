'''House Mormont'''{{Ref|GOT607}} of [[Bear Island]] is an extinct vassal [[Noble house|house]] from the [[North]] that held fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. They ruled Bear Island, an island far to the northwest of Winterfell, from the castle [[Mormont Keep]]. The head of the house was the [[Lord of Bear Island]]. The family possessed the [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] sword [[Longclaw]], which later was given to [[Jon Snow]].

House Mormont's [[Heraldry|sigil]] shows a rampant black bear on a white field, surrounded by a green base and chief.

Their [[house words]] are "Here We Stand."

==History==
===Background===
House Mormont's ancestral home of Bear Island is said to have been a gift from their liege lords House Stark, which earned them the everlasting loyalty of House Mormont. The Starks are said to have won the lands in a wrestling match between King [[Rodrik Stark]] and an [[Ironborn]].<ref>"[[The North]]"</ref> House Mormont is one of the oldest and proudest Northern Houses, but their reputation and honor have been tarnished somewhat by their former lord, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], who committed the inexcusable crime (in [[Westeros]]) of dabbling in the [[slavery|slave]] trade. The House has found it difficult to shake off this disgrace, especially Jorah's father [[Jeor Mormont]].

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Following the arrest of [[Eddard Stark]], [[Robb Stark|Robb]] calls his banners, and Lady [[Maege Mormont]] answers with a force joining Robb's army. Maege serves as a member of Robb's war council in the [[War of the Five Kings|ensuing conflict]].

Maege and the other Northern lords declare Robb the [[King in the North]] after the [[execution of Eddard Stark]].

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Maege no longer appears on King Robb's war council.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[House Frey]] takes vengeance against Robb for breaking their marriage contract, in collusion with his bannermen in [[House Bolton]] and his enemies in [[House Lannister]]. They orchestrate a massacre behind the facade of a [[Red Wedding|wedding]] at the [[Twins]]. The Northern army including the forces of House Mormont are wiped out, apart from the turncoats in Houses Bolton and Frey.

[[Roose Bolton]] is named [[Warden of the North]] by King Joffrey, meaning that House Mormont now owes him allegiance, lest they remain enemies of the [[Iron Throne]].

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Lady [[Lyanna Mormont]] rules the House from Bear Island. She refuses to pledge allegiance to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] against House Bolton. She replies to a letter from Stannis with a missive asserting her continuing loyalty to House Stark.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[Sansa Stark]] and [[Jon Snow]] visit Bear Island to recruit House Mormont to their army, intending to march on House Bolton and retake [[Winterfell]]. Lyanna is initially skeptical but renews her House's allegiance to the Starks when she is informed that the army will also need to face the [[White Walkers]]. Jon and Sansa are taken aback when they find that the entire strength of Bear Island is 62 fighting men, but she assures them that every one of them "fights with the strength of ten mainlanders."

Lyanna joins Jon, Sansa, Tormund, and Davos for the [[parley]] with [[Ramsay Bolton]], the recently-made Warden of the North. She intensely stares him down.

The 62 Mormont soldiers subsequently fight for Winterfell in the [[Battle of the Bastards]] and a shield bearing the sigil of House Mormont is used by Jon to finally bring down Ramsay.

Lyanna is among the many northern nobles and allies during the meeting in Winterfell after the battle. As the Knights of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] and the [[Free Folk]] bicker, she stands up and berates the northern Houses that didn't participate in the battle for cowardice and disloyalty, personally singling out Lords [[Wyman Manderly]], [[Robett Glover]], and [[Cley Cerwyn]] for refusing to fight the House that had wronged their families and liege lords. She then professes her loyalty to House Stark, and joins the others in proclaiming Jon the King in the North.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Lyanna is the first of the Northern leaders to agree to train both boys and girls in combat.<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

In the Great Hall of Winterfell, Lyanna is amongst the Stark loyalists who disagree with King Jon Snow's decision to accept [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]'s invitation to [[Dragonstone]]. She boldly speaks out against Jon's decision, stating that the North needs their king at home during the winter.<ref>"[[Stormborn]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Lyanna is heavily displeased when she learns that Jon has bent the knee to Daenerys, thus giving up on his title of King in the North. She recalls that House Mormont declared him their only monarch, but eventually accepts his decision and still remains at his side for the upcoming war against the White Walkers.<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

As both [[Jorah Mormont]] and Lyanna are in Winterfell, they have an argument over the future of House Mormont. Jorah, who was the rightful leader of House Mormont before his exile, does not attempt anything whatsoever to restore his position. He insists that Lyanna should remain far from the battle to safeguard their family's legacy and further it, but Lyanna strongly disagrees, stating that she will fight alongside her people.<ref>"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"</ref>

During the [[Battle of Winterfell]], Lyanna is killed when a wight giant breaks through the Winterfell gate and crushes her to death, though not before she manages to stab it in the eye with a dragonglass blade, killing it. Jorah saves Daenerys from wights following her confrontation with the [[Night King]], but is stabbed repeatedly and later succumbs to his wounds. With their deaths, House Mormont is rendered legally extinct.<ref>"[[The Long Night]]"</ref>

==Military==
House Mormont's warfare capabilities are not well understood, but according to Lyanna Mormont, "one Bear Island soldier is worth 10 mainlanders." Unlike most houses in Westeros, House Mormont employs women as soldiers due to their small population and vulnerable lands. Maege Mormont was among Robb Stark's lieutenants, backing up this claim that their forces are formidable and well-trained. However, the death of Maege and the mass slaughter at the Twins during the [[Red Wedding]] significantly weakened House Mormont's position in the North. In spite of these losses, they remained staunch Stark loyalists by refusing Stannis Baratheon's call. Lyanna Mormont agreed to help Jon Snow and Sansa Stark's quest to reclaim Winterfell from House Bolton, offering 62 men to serve in the Battle of the Bastards.<ref>"[[The Broken Man]]"</ref> At the end of this battle, Jon Snow beats Ramsey Bolton using a Mormont shield suggesting that their forces survived. 

Mormont soldiers are quite distinguishable from other Northern soldiers. Their uniforms consist of suits of studded leather and steel pauldrons, and they carry shields with the Mormont sigil into battle.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Bear-island-02.jpg|thumb|200px|View on [[Bear Island]], ancestral home of House Mormont.]]
The sigil of House Mormont is a bear surrounded by white with green borders, some version featuring standing or sitting bears. On the simplest level this is a reference to their ancestral home, Bear Island. On a deeper level, it embodies the ferocity, loyalty, and warrior spirit within House Mormont. Up until Season 6, the bear on their banner stood on all fours, but subsequently it was raised to two legs, as can be seen in Battle of the Bastards, when Jon grabs one of their shields to defend himself for Ramsay Bolton, which reinforces the protective ferocity of the House, similar to that of House Mormont. This also means that House Stark is always protected by House Mormont, since they pledge allegiance to them and only them. They also signify bravery, rough exteriors and making the best of limited resources, pride, and loyalty. Since by the start of the series, all male adults are not present on Bear Island, Maege Mormont now leads the House. After she dies fighting for Robb Stark in the War of the Five Kings, the 10-year old Lyanna Mormont takes command of House Mormont (no later than early Season 5). She is very strong and committed to protect despite her rather small stature. Jeor Mormont also signified similar qualities as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, but was sadly killed in the Mutiny at Craster's Keep. The most depicted Mormont - Jorah Mormont - on the other hand, seems to be a black sheep in the family, but over time, his Mormont qualities become clearer.

Their motto, "Here We Stand", signifies the willingness to continue and they fact they do not five in the face of great odds (such as [[Greyscale]], something Jorah encounters in Season 5), and dedication. Jorah survives beatings, enslavement, and a supposedly incurable illness just to return to the service of his love, Daenerys. [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] cured his Greyscale out of respect for his former boss: his father, so even when unasked for, Jorah became victim to another trait of the Mormonts: protection of family. They all embody willingness to fight and sacrifice, and standing for the cause that mean everything to them.

Their banner colors represent their outer ferocity and inner warmth. Black is usually associated with Winter, signifying their allegiance to House Stark and northerners through and through. Black is also associated with the trademark Mormont seriousness and joining the Night's Watch, something they extensively do. Green is a colour of nature, signifying the overgrown forest biome of their home.

House Mormont is a House that does not have the choice of not fighting due to their surrounding, which is why the [[warrior women]] are born. Lyanna Mormont is a paragon representation of such a woman.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Mormont is a stalwart supporter of the Starks. According to legend, King Rodrik Stark won the island in a wrestling match (presumably with the ironborn lord who held the island at the time) and appointed the Mormonts to rule there.

Bear Island is beautiful, but also icy, cold and remote. The Mormont "castle" is a large, comfortable but still relatively primitive wooden longhouse (due to a lack of stone on the island). [[Bear]]s still prowl the woods of the island, giving the Mormonts their sigil. The people of Bear Island are fierce, hardy and strong. Unlike most of [[Westeros]], the women of Bear Island are trained in the use of weapons and warfare, as they are expected to defend hearth and home should [[Free Folk|wildling]] raiders from the [[Frozen Shore]] (just to the north) launch an attack.

Lord [[Jeor Mormont]] ruled the House honorably and with distinction. He chose to 'retire' from the role of lord and took the black, joining the [[Night's Watch]] and rising rapidly through their ranks until he became [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]], a rank he held until his death. Jeor felt able to do this as his son [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] had proven to be a great warrior, winning immense honors during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] and the following tourney. Lord Jorah proved an effective ruler for several years, until he disgraced himself in an incident involving slavers. Lord [[Eddard Stark]] stripped him of his title and lands and Jorah fled to the [[Free Cities]] rather than face justice. Jeor's younger sister [[Maege Mormont|Maege]] became the ruling Lady of Bear Island the head of House Mormont, to Jeor's disquiet. However, as members of the Night's Watch serve for life he was unable to return to Bear Island to resume his former rule.

Lady Maege Mormont has since proven to be a strong and effective ruler of the House.

Dacey Mormont is the eldest of Maege's five daughters and a proud warrior in her own right. She serves as one of Robb's personal guard throughout the War of the Five Kings. Dacey is slain at the Red Wedding: she was one of the few Stark bannermen who survived the initial attack by the Frey crossbowmen, and managed to fend off another attacker by smashing a flagon of wine in his face. She ran across the hall to the door but just as she was about to reach the exit, a dozen Frey men-at-arms burst through the door in front of her led by Ryman Frey, who drove a longaxe into her belly.{{Bookref|ASOS|51}}

In the novels, it is unknown if Maege Mormont is still alive, because she was not at the Red Wedding. Before going to the Twins, Robb sent her and [[Galbart Glover]] ahead to the [[crannogmen]] of [[House Reed]] beforehand to prepare them for an assault to retake [[Moat Cailin]].{{Bookref|ASOS|45}} Her fate is unknown, except that two of her daughters are with her.{{Bookref|ADWD|35}} 

Lyanna Mormont's reply letter to Stannis is the same in the novels. Jon wonders why the ten year old Lyanna wrote it, however, given that she has three surviving elder sisters (it is possible the Mormonts let her write it to scorn Stannis).{{Bookref|ADWD|3}} The answer is given by Alysane, Maege's second daughter, who tells Asha while marching to Winterfell that "Lyra and Jory are with our mother"{{Bookref|ADWD|35}} - thus Lyanna is by default the ''acting'' "Lady of Bear Island", while her mother and sisters are away, similar to how [[Bran Stark|Bran]] was the acting "[[Lord of Winterfell]]" in Season 2 when his older brother Robb was not physically present to rule.

Some time after sending the rejection letter, the Mormonts change their mind about supporting Stannis: an armed Mormont force led by Alysane appears unexpectedly while [[Fight by Deepwood Motte#In the books|Stannis attacks the ironborn at Deepwood Motte]], and assists him to liberate the castle, as he writes Jon afterwards. House Mormont, alongside other northern Houses, swears fealty to Stannis and joins the [[Battle in the ice#In the books|march to Winterfell]]. Alysane is later assigned as one of the guards of Asha Greyjoy.{{Bookref|ADWD|35}}

Alysane Mormont also claims her two [[bastard]] children are fathered by bears. One of the titles of [[Tormund]] is Father To Bears, meaning that some of the Mormonts may have wildling blood.
