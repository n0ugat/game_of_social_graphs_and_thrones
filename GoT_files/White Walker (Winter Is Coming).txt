{{Quote|I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers.|[[Will]] to [[Eddard Stark]] before his [[execution]]|Winter Is Coming}}
This '''White Walker '''was among [[White Walkers]] who slaughtered a band of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] and arranged their bodies in a strange shape.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
The [[Night's Watch]] ranger [[Will]] tracks the wildlings and finds slaughtered bodies arranged in a strange shape. Nearby, he observes a corpse of a [[wildling girl]] nailed to a tree. Horrified he tells his companions Ser [[Waymar Royce]] and [[Gared]] and leads them to the scene. The bodies have vanished and [[Gared]] sends Will to track them further. While Will tracks the bodies, the wildling girl from the band returns as a [[wight]] and stalks him through the trees. Horrified, Will runs away.{{Ref|GOT101}}

Meanwhile, the White Walker ambush Will's companions and kills Ser Waymar and chases Gard through the forest. He catches and beheads Gared just as Will runs into the horrid scene. The White Walker tosses Gared's head in front of Will and lets him flee south. Will's news of White Walkers' return is taken as the ramblings of a madman and he is executed by [[Eddard Stark]] for desertion.{{Ref|GOT101}}

==Personality==
Little is known about personality of this White Walker. Just like other [[White Walkers]], he never talks. But he committed numerous immoral and cruel actions, which show his cruel personality. He is highly cunning, devious, sinister, villainous and ruthless, as he slaughtered a band of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] and later murdered Ser Waymar. He also resurrected a [[wildling girl]] as a [[wight]].

==Behind the scenes==
[[Spencer Wilding]] played the role in the original version of the pilot shot by [[Thomas McCarthy]] and was replaced by [[Ian Whyte]] when the pilot was re-shot by [[Tim Van Patten]]. Footage of Wilding remained in the final cut of the episode so he retained his credit.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the White Walkers are more commonly called the Others. There is no mention that they arrange the bodies of their victims in any particular pattern.

There is a longer duel with Ser Waymar before he is killed. Will is killed by Ser Waymar, returned as a wight while Gared escapes south. The Walkers speak in [[Skroth|a language]] Will does not recognize in the books.
