'''Sheepstealer'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} is a wild [[dragon]] residing on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Sheepstealer is a scabrous mud-brown dragon with a taste for mutton.{{Ref|HOTD208}} He has never been claimed by a [[dragonrider]].{{Ref|HOTD206}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] mentions the three wild dragons who nest on Dragonstone during a meeting of the [[Black Council]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}[[File:Sheepstealer flies over the Vale and Rhaena watches..png|thumb|Sheepstealer flies over the Vale while Rhaena watches.]]
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Since the beginning of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Sheepstealer has migrated to the [[Vale of Arryn]]. [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] and [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] find the charred bones of livestock eaten by Sheepstealer near the [[Eyrie]].{{Ref|HOTD206}}
[[File:House of the Dragon Season 2 Rhaena Targaryen and Sheepstealer.jpg|thumb|Rhaena meets Sheepstealer.]]
Sheepstealer is soaring through the Vale as Rhaena spots him. He then feasts on charred sheep carcasses before he roars at the approaching Rhaena.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Sheepstealer was a slender mud brown dragon with a taste for mutton. He hatched sometime during the youth of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] and resided within the [[Dragonmont]], hunting sheep as far as [[Driftmark]] and the [[Wendwater]].

Although Sheepstealer was in the [[Vale of Arryn]] at some point, he did not take refuge there during the time that Rhaena was Jeyne Arryn's ward.

During the [[Red Sowing]], [[Silver Denys]] attempted to claim Sheepstealer (not [[Vermithor]]). Sheepstealer ripped his arm off, and while his sons were trying to staunch the wound, the [[Cannibal]] descended on them and devoured them all.
