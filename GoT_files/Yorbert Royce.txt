Lord '''Yorbert Royce''' is the [[Lord of Runestone]] during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]. His relation to his heir, [[Rhea Royce]], is unknown.

==Behind the scenes==
Yorbert is mentioned in the script for "[[The Heirs of the Dragon]]."{{Scriptref|HOTD101}} He is not mentioned in the final version,{{Ref|HOTD101}} but his existence is implied in "[[We Light the Way]]" when [[Rhea Royce]] is said to have "stood to inherit Runestone" rather than being the ruling Lady of Runestone.{{Ref|HOTD105}} The Character Guide confirms that in the TV series, Rhea was the heir to Runestone and never inherited the castle,{{Guideref|Rhea Royce}} meaning Lord Yorbert lives much longer than in the books; by the starting point of the TV series, 112 AC,{{Dateref|The Heirs of the Dragon}} Yorbert has already been dead for at least nine years in the books.{{Bookref|F&B|12}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Yorbert was the Lord of Runestone during the late reign of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]]. He served as [[regent]] and [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] for the underage Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]], attending the [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council of 101 AC]] in her stead.

By 103 AC, Yorbert had been succeeded by his heir, Lady Rhea Royce.{{Bookref|F&B|12}}
