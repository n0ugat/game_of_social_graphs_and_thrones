==Biography==
===Background===
Lyonel participated in the [[Conquest of Dorne]] and was declared [[Steward]] of [[Dorne]] by [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Daeron I Targaryen]], the Young Dragon. He was murdered, however, when he pulled down a sash by his bed to summon his consort and a hundred red scorpions fell on him. His death ignited a revolt that led to the death of King Daeron and the end of the [[Iron Throne]] occupation.{{Ref|H&L401}}{{Ref|H&L414}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[Olenna Tyrell]] mentions Lyonel, though not by name, as the last Tyrell to have visited Dorne. She was musing on whether her meeting with [[Ellaria Sand]] and the [[Sand Snakes]] at the [[Water Gardens]] would go any better, which it apparently did.{{Ref|GOT610}}

==Quotes==
{{Quote|The last time a [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] came to [[Dorne]], he was assassinated. A hundred red scorpions, was it?|[[Olenna Tyrell]] to [[Ellaria Sand]] and three [[Sand Snakes]], referring to Lyonel.|The Winds of Winter}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lyonel Tyrell was an infant during the [[Dance of the Dragons]], with his mother ruling the [[Reach]] as [[Regent]]. She chose to remain neutral during the civil war, thus the Reach was divided between the supporters of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] and those of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]].

Decades later, Lyonel commanded the army that invaded Dorne via [[Prince's Pass]]. After the Young Dragon's initial victory, Daeron appointed Lyonel as governor of Dorne. The Dornishmen however proved cunning and impossible to rule, particularly under a man of the Reach - the Reach and Dorne having been bitter enemies for centuries. Thus, Lord Lyonel moved with his train from one keep to the next, chasing rebels out and keeping the knees of the Dornishmen bent. It was his custom to turn the lords of the keeps he stayed in out of their chambers and sleep in their place. One night at [[Sandstone]], seat of [[House Qorgyle]], finding himself in a bed with a heavy velvet canopy, he pulled a sash near the pillows to summon a wench. When he did so, the canopy opened and a hundred red scorpions fell upon him. His death sparked new revolts, and in a fortnight all the work of the Young Dragon was undone, eventually bringing the about the death of King Daeron himself.

In the third novel, [[Oberyn Martell]] tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] the aforementioned story; he does not mention Lyonel's first name, just refers to him as "Lord Tyrell".
