'''House Tarly'''{{Ref|GOT107}} of [[Horn Hill]] is a [[noble house]] from the [[Reach]] and a vassal of Lord [[Bronn]] of [[Highgarden]]. House Tarly has a militarist tradition,<ref>"[[The Reach]]"</ref> and possesses a [[Valyrian steel]] sword called [[Heartsbane]].<ref>"[[Valyrian Steel (short)|Valyrian Steel]]"</ref>

The Tarly [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a striding huntsman, red on green. Their [[house words]] are "First in Battle."

They swore allegiance to [[House Lannister]], the new royal family after the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|extinction]] of [[House Baratheon of King's Landing]], at the onset of the [[Last War]], betraying House Tyrell. Lord [[Randyll Tarly]] fights alongside [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Jaime Lannister]] under the promise of being named [[Warden of the South]] after the end of the war. After the executions of Randyll and his son [[Dickon Tarly]] in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], their allegiance is uncertain. Randyll's daughter [[Talla Tarly]] has become the new head of the House and Lady of Horn Hill, while his son, [[Samwell Tarly]], is allied with [[Jon Snow]] and the [[Night's Watch]]. With the end of the war after the [[Battle of King's Landing]], they become the vassals of Lord Bronn of Highgarden.

==Military==
House Tarly commands a formidable military, with a great martial tradition. They are renowned as being the House which produces the very finest of soldiers in the Reach (though House Tyrell once produced more by sheer numbers, albeit slightly less well trained than Lord Randyll Tarly's own unique forces). Horn Hill was able to field thousands of men, and their entire army remained unscathed during the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Like most Houses of the Reach, House Tarly is wealthy since the Reach is the most fertile and agriculturally productive region in Westeros. 

Tarly men-at-arms are well-equipped in a uniform fashion, and well-trained by House Tarly. They are also battle hardened from previous wars such as [[Robert's Rebellion]], wherein [[Randyll Tarly]] caused [[Robert Baratheon]]'s only [[Battle of Ashford|defeat]] in the war. 

House Tarly, alongside their new overlords, House Lannister, easily managed to defeat House Tyrell's forces during the Fall of Highgarden, causing [[Olenna Tyrell]]'s death as well as the extinction of House Tyrell.

However, their army (or at least a significant part of it) was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], alongside the Lannister troops. Though exact numbers are not known for the original strength of the contingent of the House Tarly units involved in the battle, or for that matter their exact losses by the end of the battle, it can be clearly seen that losses for the Lannister-Tarly forces were severe, in an overall sense.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tarly is a loyal vassal of the Tyrells. Lord Randyll Tarly has a formidable reputation as a general, and has been named the finest battlefield commander in all of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Randyll Tarly was the only royalist general to win a decisive victory over [[Robert Baratheon]], defeating his army at the Battle of Ashford despite being outnumbered. Randyll's skills were later squandered during the fruitless [[Siege of Storm's End]], while Robert and [[Eddard Stark]] won great victories further north.

Lord Randyll is a hard, ruthless man. When his son Samwell showed a preference for songs, poetry, fine clothes and good food over martial valor and a love of warfare, Randyll disinherited him and sent him to the [[Wall]] to join the Night's Watch. His fiercer, younger son Dickon was made heir in Samwell's stead. One of the major reasons Randyll states behind forcing Sam out, was that he did not want [[Heartsbane]], the ancestral [[Valyrian steel]] sword of House Tarly, to come into the hands of a craven. There is some irony in this, as Sam goes on to kill one of the [[White Walkers]] with a blade of [[Dragonglass|obsidian]], one of two materials, the other implied to be Valyrian steel, that can harm them.
