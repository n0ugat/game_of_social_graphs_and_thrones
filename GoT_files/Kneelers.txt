A '''kneeler'''{{Ref|GOT410}} is a derogatory name used by the [[Free Folk]] to describe people who live south of the [[Wall]]. In [[Westeros]] kneeling is an [[Bending the knee|act of submission]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyG1rk1XgT4 Game of Thrones: Season 3 - Inside The Wildlings (HBO)]</ref>

The Free Folk do not kneel for anyone, while the kneelers are subject to laws, lords and kings. The Free Folk view the kneelers as lacking freedom, whereas the people of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] view the "wildlings" as savage, lawless and uncivilized killers, rapists and thieves. However, surviving Free Folk have knelt forcefully to [[Stannis Baratheon]] and willingly for [[Jon Snow]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, "kneelers" is also a derogatory term used by the Free Folk to refer to those south of the Wall, as they view kneeling as an act of renouncing one's freedom.
