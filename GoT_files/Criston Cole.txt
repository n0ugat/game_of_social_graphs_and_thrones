{{Quote|I took an oath. As a knight of your Kingsguard. An oath of chastity. I've broken it. I've soiled my white cloak and it's the only thing I have to my fucking name! I thought if we were married, I might be able to restore it.|Criston to Rhaenyra Targaryen|We Light the Way}}
Ser '''Criston Cole''', also known as the '''Kingmaker''',{{Ref|HOTD204}} is a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Cole]], [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]], and [[Hand of the King]] under [[Aegon II Targaryen]]. He previously served as a member of the [[Kingsguard]] under [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and as [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s personal guard. Criston is one of the primary leaders of the [[Greens]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. 

==Biography==
===Background===
Criston is a member of House Cole, a minor house of the [[Dornish Marches]] in service to [[House Dondarrion]]. His [[Criston Cole's father|father]] is the steward at [[Blackhaven]]. Criston is of [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] descent.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Criston had an adventurous youth, but his station was never high enough for a formal betrothal, so he could have married a commonborn girl if he had wished before he spoke his vows as a knight of the Kingsguard. He fought for a year as a footsoldier in border conflicts with [[Dorne]]. After taking part in the razing of two watchtowers along the [[Boneway]], he was knighted by Ser [[Arlan Dondarrion]].{{Ref|HOTD102}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Criston vs Daemon.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Criston duels Daemon.]]
Criston competes in the [[Heir's Tournament]]. In his first joust he defeats a knight of [[House Tarly]]. He then defeats Ser [[Borros Baratheon|Borros]] and Lord [[Boremund Baratheon]]. Criston next faces Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] after several evenly matched tilts, Daemon is unhorsed by him, with Daemon then demanding a contest of arms on foot. Criston readies his flail as the prince draws his sword [[Dark Sister]]. In fierce combat, Criston breaks apart Daemon's shield, with Daemon swinging at his breastplate in return. With the prince eventually kicking Criston to the ground and as Daemon gloats, Criston rises to his feet and knocks him to the ground and forces the prince to yield. After his victory, Criston asks for the favor of Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], who obliges throwing her laurel wreath down to him and wishes him luck.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

[[File:TRP Viserys and Criston Still.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Criston is sworn in to the Kingsguard.]]
Six months after the tourney Ser Criston is named to the [[Kingsguard]], at the insistence of Princess Rhaenyra, as he is the only candidate who has real combat experience. He later travels to [[Dragonstone]] with a detachment of men led by Ser [[Otto Hightower]], the [[Hand of the King]], to force Prince Daemon to give up his occupation of the castle. When Daemon "accidentally" calls him "Ser Crispin", Criston retorts by reminding Daemon of how he defeated him at the Heir's Tournament. The situations escalates, and both sides draw their swords, but Princess Rhaenyra arrives and manages to convince Daemon to return the dragon egg without bloodshed.{{Ref|HOTD102}}

Three years later, King Viserys organizes a royal hunt in the [[Kingswood]], in honor of his son [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s second nameday. Before departure, the king approaches Ser Criston, asking after the whereabouts of Rhaenyra, but Criston confesses he doesn't know where she is.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

[[File:SOHN Rhaenyra and Criston 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Criston walks with Rhaenyra in the Kingswood.]]
Later, at the camp in the Kingswood, Criston sees Rhaenyra storm out of the tent and ride off on her horse. He swiftly mounts his own horse and chases after her. He manages to catch her, and she tells him that her father was trying to marry her off to Lord [[Jason Lannister]]. Criston jokingly asks if she wants him to kill Jason, which seems to amuse Rhaenyra. He tells her they should return to camp, but she suggests they take in the Kingswood. As they walk, Rhaenyra asks him if he was ever betrothed, to which he confesses that his station was never high enough for a formal betrothal, though he could have married a common-born girl had he wished. Rhaenyra tells him he's lucky to have a say in his own life, as despite being the princess, she feels she has no real power. Criston reminds her that it was only because of her that he became a Kingsguard - the highest honor any member of his house has ever known.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

That night, as he and Rhaenyra sit by a fire, Criston requests once again, that they return to camp, as her father will be worried, but she is still unwilling. Rhaenyra asks him if he thinks the people will ever truly accept her as their ruler, to which he replies that they will have no choice but to. At that moment, there is a rustling in the nearby bushes. Criston pulls out his sword, preparing to defend his princess from danger. After a tense silence, a boar charges out of the bushes, knocking Criston over, and attacking Rhaenyra. Criston recovers, and runs the boar through with his sword, saving his princess, who finishes the beast off by stabbing it multiple times in rage.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

As the two of them head back to camp with their kill, they are approached by another animal: A [[white hart]]. Criston slowly draws his sword, but Rhaenyra softly tells him not to. He obeys, and the stag turns and runs off. When they return to camp with the dead boar, they are greeted by incredulous stares from everyone gathered.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

[[File:KOTNS Boremund Rhaenyra and Criston Still.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Criston with Rhaenyra at Storm's End.]]
Some time later, Ser Criston accompanies Princess Rhaenyra on a tour to find potential suitors for her hand. During an audience at [[Storm's End]]. Rhaenyra dismisses every suitor that approaches, and when a fight breaks out between [[Willem Blackwood]] and [[Jerrel Bracken]], she tells Criston that they're leaving, and orders him to have their ship prepared to return to [[King's Landing]], even though the tour was supposed to continue on to [[Bitterbridge]]. As they are leaving, they hear a yell, and turn to see that Willem has run Jerrel through with his sword. Criston tells Rhaenyra to look away.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

As they sail back to King's Landing, Rhaenyra asks Criston if she thinks her father will be angry, to which Criston sarcastically asks whether she refers to her refusal of all the suitors or her ending the tour early. Just then, they hear a dragon's cry overhead. Criston orders everyone to take cover, before [[Caraxes]] swoops down, brushing their ship, and dangerously rocking it. Criston immediately checks on the princess, and calls for the [[Order of Maesters|maesters]], but Rhaenyra insists she's fine.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

[[File:KOTNS Rhaenyra and Criston Still.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Rhaenyra seduces Criston.]]
That night, Criston bids Rhaenyra goodnight and stands guard outside her bedroom door. Several hours later, much to his bewilderment, Rhaenyra (who, unbeknownst to him, had slipped out of her room through a secret passage and joined Daemon for a night on the town) enters her bedroom again, now dressed as a commoner. As he checks to make sure she's all right, Rhaenyra, sexually charged from her exploits with Daemon, playfully grabs his helmet from him and holds it out of reach, despite his impatient requests that she return it. Eventually, she holds it out to him, and kisses him when he moves to take it, stunning him. Ignoring his halfhearted protests, Rhaenyra begins to slowly strip Criston of his armor. Criston hesitates, looking meaningfully at his white cloak as he takes it off, torn between his vow of chastity and his desire for his princess. Eventually, he gives into temptation and starts kissing her back, and they share a night of ecstasy.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

The next morning, Criston, visibly uncomfortable after the previous night's encounter, enters Rhaenyra's chambers to give her a summons from Queen [[Alicent Hightower]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

That evening, Criston and several other members of the Kingsguard, escort Rhaenyra to her father's chambers. Criston is visibly nervous as he opens the door for her.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

Criston accompanies Rhaenyra, Viserys, and the new King's Hand, Lord [[Lyonel Strong]], to [[Driftmark]], to propose a marriage to Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] between Rhaenyra and his son Ser [[Laenor Velaryon]]. On the way back, Criston, still guilt-ridden over breaking his Kingsguard vow, approaches Rhaenyra, and asks her to run away with him to [[Essos]], where she could marry him - a marriage for love, not duty. As Rhaenyra has often talked about how much she hates her position, Criston believes this would benefit both of them: She would get to do as she wishes, and he could escape the shame of breaking his vow. After a few seconds of silence, however, Rhaenyra refuses, saying that she doesn't want to live in infamy, and must do her duty, no matter how much she may hate it. She does, however, inform him that she and Laenor have come to an understanding: After they perform their royal duty, they each pursue their own desires. Criston, distraught and angry, accuses her of wanting to make him her whore. He gave up his honor and soiled his white cloak - the only thing he has to his name - for Rhaenyra, and with her refusal, he now sees no way of restoring it.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

[[File:WLTW Alicent and Criston Still.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Criston confesses to Alicent.]]
Upon returning to King's Landing, Criston is summoned by Queen Alicent, who questions him about a rumor she heard that Rhaenyra had been involved in a "breach of morals". Unbeknownst to him, the rumor she refers to is that Rhaenyra had sex with her uncle Daemon, but Criston believes that she has learned about his own sexual encounter with Rhaenyra. Seeing one last chance to restore his honor in death, Criston confesses his sin, only asking for a merciful death. Alicent, however, merely thanks him for his honesty and dismisses him.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

[[File:Criston 2nd Teaser.png|thumb|200px|left|Criston beats Joffrey Lonmouth to death.]]
Throughout the welcoming feast for Rhaenyra and Laenor's marriage, Criston stands by, watching them dance together, visibly on edge. He is approached by Ser [[Joffrey Lonmouth]], who subtly admits to being Laenor's [[paramour]], and hints that he knows Criston's secret. Joffrey tells Criston that they should swear to guard the two of them and their secrets for the sake of them all. This perceived threat pushes Criston over the edge, and he starts pummeling Joffrey, to the shock and horror of everyone gathered. When Laenor tries to pull him off, Criston punches him before proceeding to beat Joffrey to death, caving in the entire left side of his face. After staring down at his victim for a few seconds, Criston silently rises and walks out, everyone too terrified to stop him.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

[[File:WLTW Criston Cole Still 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Criston prepares to commit suicide.]]
Criston walks out to the [[godswood]], removing his white cloak and his sword, and with his honor now beyond repair and nothing else to live for, prepares to take his own life with his dagger. However, his suicide attempt is interrupted by Queen Alicent who calls out to him.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

[[File:TPATQ Aemond, Aegon, Harwin, Criston, Lucerys & Jacaerys.png|thumb|left|200px|Harwin attacks Criston.]]
A decade later, Criston is now a firm ally of Queen Alicent in return for her saving him at his lowest. While operating as a [[master-at-arms]] for Rhaenyra and Alicent's sons, Criston intentionally allows [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], Alicent's eldest son, to roughhouse [[Jacaerys Velaryon]], Rhaenyra's eldest son. When [[Harwin Strong]] intervenes, Criston alludes to the rumor that Jacaerys and his brothers [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] and [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] are Harwin's [[bastard]] sons, which provokes Harwin to start beating him. The fallout over this leads Harwin to leave King's Landing.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

[[File:Alicent and Criston.png|thumb|200px|right|Criston and Alicent at Laena Velaryon's funeral.]]
At the funeral of [[Laena Velaryon]], Criston notices Lord [[Larys Strong]] staring at Alicent. While Alicent assures him that it is simply Larys's pride at becoming the new [[Lord of Harrenhal]], Criston remains suspicious. He is later given the night's watch by Lord Commander [[Harrold Westerling]].{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Criston is among the Kingsguard who separate Rhaenyra and Daemon's children from Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], who has lost an eye in the fight. Everyone is summoned to the [[Hall of Nine]] by the king, who berates the Kingsguard for failing to prevent the fight. Criston tries to shift blame onto [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Luke]], [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]], and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]], but Viserys silences him. Alicent later orders Criston to take one of Luke's eyes as revenge, but he stays put. When she tries to do it herself, Criston follows her, but he is held back by Daemon.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

[[File:OT Aemond.png|thumb|200px|left|Criston spars with Aemond.]]
Six years following these events, Criston has tutored Aemond into becoming a skilled warrior. The prince bests him in a sparring match, to which Criston says he will be winning tournaments in no time.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[File:TGC Criston & Harrold.png|thumb|200px|right|Criston defies Harrold.]]
After the death of King Viserys, Criston attends the subsequent meeting of the [[Small Council]]. He moves behind Lord [[Lyman Beesbury]] when he protests the accession of Prince Aegon to the throne, and accidentally kills him in an attempt to seat him, puncturing his skull against his council totem. Ser Harrold then orders Criston to drop his sword and cloak, but Criston draws his sword, saying he will not suffer insults to the queen. Alicent orders him to sheath his sword, saying no insult was done. Shortly afterwards, Harrold resigns his post when he is ordered to go to Dragonstone and murder Rhaenyra's family, to the smug satisfaction of Criston.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Criston and Aemond Still.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Criston and Aemond look for Aegon.]]
Later in the day, Criston is secretly ordered by Alicent to go into King's Landing, find Aegon, and bring him to her. Criston takes Aemond with him. They do not find him in the [[Street of Silk]], which Aemond knows Aegon frequents. Afterwards, Aemond vents about how he should be king due to him putting in effort and doing his duty, to which Criston relates by saying that he has also had to toil for what others are freely given.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

The two happen to pick up the trail of [[Arryk Cargyll|Arryk]] and [[Erryk Cargyll]], who have been secretly sent by [[Otto Hightower]] for the same purpose. They follow the two to the [[Grand Sept]], where they find Aegon asleep underneath a shrine table. Criston stops Arryk from leaving with Aegon, and the two fight while Aemond grabs Aegon. Criston defeats Arryk, and then tells Aegon that "the queen awaits."{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Before Aegon's coronation, Criston is appointed [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] by Alicent for his loyalty.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Kingmaker.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Criston crowns Aegon.]]
In the [[Dragonpit]], Criston crowns Aegon with [[Aegon I Targaryen|the Conqueror]]'s own [[crown]], and hails him as the true heir to the [[Iron Throne]]. The coronation is interrupted when [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] bursts through the floor on her dragon [[Meleys]]. Alicent orders Criston to take Queen [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] to safety, but Meleys only roars at them before she and Rhaenys fly away to warn Rhaenyra.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Criston has sex with [[Alicent Hightower]] when [[Helaena Targaryen]] rushes in, clutching Princess [[Jaehaera Targaryen]], following her [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|son]]'s murder.{{Ref|HOTD201}}
[[File:2x2 Criston Otto and Aegon Still.jpg|thumb|Ser Criston becomes [[Hand of the King]] after Ser [[Otto Hightower]] is removed.]]
At the following [[Small Council]] meeting, Criston is interrogated by [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] on where he was at the time of Jaehaerys' murder, to which he says he was abed. Later, he confronts [[Arryk Cargyll]] over his soiled white cloak, accusing him of not fully respecting the [[Kingsguard]]. He then commands Cargyll to infiltrate [[Dragonstone]] and slay [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], eventually resulting in his death. After Ser [[Otto Hightower]] is fired by Aegon II, Aegon names Criston [[Hand of the King]] as his "steel fist" for the wars to come.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

[[Criston Cole|Criston]] nervously anticipates his first council meeting as [[Hand of the King]]. He is startled by the arrival of his squire, informing him that the rest of the council is waiting for him. On his way towards the council chamber, Criston encounters Ser [[Martyn Reyne]] and Ser [[Eddard Waters]], newly clad in the armour of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]], lazily sitting and talking. Upon seeing him, the two Knights stand and take their positions. Upon arriving at the council chamber, Criston takes his new seat on King Aegon's right-hand side, and comments on the new Kingsguard appointments. Aegon explains that Ser Martyn, Ser Eddard and Ser [[Leon Estermont]] were appointed to replace the Kingsguard who have either died or defected to Rhaenyra's cause. When both [[Jasper Wylde]] and [[Alicent Hightower]] denounce Criston's scheme to send Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]] to assassinate Rhaenyra as rash, Criston defends his actions, saying they cannot wait in their castles for war to come to them. Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] remarks that the war has already begun, thanks to House Bracken attacking the Blackwoods. Aegon is pleased to learn of Lord Samwell Blackwood's death in battle, calling it first blood to the [[Greens]], though Ser [[Tyland Lannister]] argues the casualties sustained by both sides make it difficult to call the Burning Mill a victory for their cause. Jasper insist the battle was merely a continuation of the age-old feud between the two Houses, but King Aegon angrily insists both he and the Blacks will consider it war, and demands reponses. [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] proposes sending a raven to [[Riverrun]], ordering Lord Grover Tully to rein in his bannermen, but Jasper insults Grover as an old fool unable to control them. When Aegon asks Jasper for an alternative, Jasper suggests summoning both Lord [[Ormund Hightower]]'s army, along with Aegon's younger brother Prince [[Daeron Targaryen]] and [[Tessarion|his dragon]] to subdue the Riverlands. Tyland dismisses the idea, insisting Ormund's army is months away. Tyland adds his twin brother, Lord [[Jason Lannister]], is raising the armies of the [[Westerlands]] at [[Casterly Rock]], and they will be able to march in a matter of weeks. Orwyle proposes marching both armies together against their enemies, prompting Tyland to mock Orwyle's lack of experience in military matters before Alicent shouts at them to cease squabbling.

Recognising that control of Harrenhal is essential to subdue the Riverlands, Criston proposes he take a small force of hand-picked men and march out. Alicent insists he will need greater numbers to deal with the rebellious Rivermen, but Criston insists he needs to move swiftly; his plan is to force the Crownlands houses that have declared for Rhaenyra to submit to him and add their forces to his, then link up with the forces of House Bracken and take Harrenhal. Alicent mocks the plan as hasty and likely to fail, so Criston turns to Aegon for support. Aegon asks if Criston means to take Aemond and [[Vhagar]] with him; after exchanging a glance with Aemond, Criston admits he intends for Vhagar to remain and defend King's Landing. Satisfied they're marching to war, Aegon declares his intention to accompany Cole's army along with his own dragon [[Sunfyre]]; Criston insists that having a dragon with him will draw too much attention. Aegon argues that without a dragon to aid them, Cole's army will be defenseless if Rhaenyra deploys one of her own against him, but Cole insists taking a dragon with his army only increases the likelihood the Blacks will send out their own in response, with Aemond adding they cannot risk losing the king in battle, much to Aegon's displeasure.
[[File:2x3 Gwayne Alicent and Criston Still.jpg|thumb|Criston meeting Ser Gwayne. ]]
A few days later, Criston has mustered his army, giving himself short hair cut and prepares to march from King's Landing. In the Red Keep's courtyard, Alicent presents her brother, Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]] to Criston, explaining he is recently arrived from Oldtown and will be joining the march. Gwayne backhandedly insults Criston for his Dornish origins and for displacing their father, Ser Otto Hightower, as Hand of the King before taking his leave. Alicent offers Criston her prayers for his safety and, at his request, her favour to wear into battle, before Criston mounts his horse and leads his army from the city.

Out in the [[Crownlands]], Criston intercepts Gwayne and a party of Hightower knights leaving their army's camp to enjoy themselves at a nearby tavern. As Gwayne blithely dismisses Cole's protests, the sun passes behind a cloud, and Cole realizes they're exposed on open ground, and being watched from overhead. He shouts at the group to make for a forest nearby, and Gwayne and his retinue panic as they spot the dragon [[Moondancer]], ridden by Baela Targaryen, diving towards them. The Greens make the treeline just ahead of Moondancer, who breaks off her attack to avoid crashing into the trees, with Cole, Gwayne and their companions nervously watching as Baela circles the canopy overhead before flying off. Gwayne thanks Criston for saving his life, but Cole angrily rebukes him, snapping that now the Blacks know they're marching, others will come hunting for them. Criston orders the army will now have to move at night under tree cover to avoid detection, and makes it clear to Gwayne there will be no more stopping at inns along the way.

His army has forced [[House Stokeworth]] and [[House Rosby]] to both recant their fealty to Rhaenyra and pledged their allegiance to King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] without a fight, citing the [[assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen]] as the reason for it.
[[File:S2 Criston Cole 1.jpg|thumb|Following the Sack of Duskendale.]]
Ser Criston Cole and his army [[Sack of Duskendale|sack the town of Duskendale]], following numerous military successes of his campaign through the [[Crownlands]]. The Lord Commander promises mercy to any man who [[Bending the knee|bends the knee]] to King Aegon II and raises arms against Rhaenyra Targaryen. Lord [[Gunthor Darklyn]], loyal to the monarch who named his son, Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]] to her [[Queensguard]], refuses the terms of surrender and lambasts the "Kingmaker" for his dishonorable conduct, before being summarily [[Execution|executed]] by the latter for treason. Cole's squire brings him a message, prompting him to change course and order the army to go East, following the coastline, much to the confusion of Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]], who expected them to press towards Harrenhal.

Arriving at the vicinity of Rook's Rest, Ser Gwayne counsels that the best course of action is to rest up and wait until nightfall to conduct their attack on the castle, but Criston insists on pushing forward and striking at daylight. Gwayne reminds him of their recent encounter with Baela and Moondancer, and that the [[Blacks]]<nowiki/>possess many dragons ready to strike at a moment's notice just from across the bay on Dragonstone. Ser Criston still remains confident in his plan.

he Green army begins marching out of their encampment in the nearby forest to assault Rook's Rest, deploying multiple siege weapons and hundreds of infantry. Ser Criston has the levies of Houses Rosby, Stokeworth, and Darklyn move forward while keeping the forces of [[House Targaryen]] and [[House Hightower]] in reserve. As they advance forward, Criston's army is met with heavy resistance from the Staunton garrison, who begin subjecting the attackers to multiple arrow volleys.
[[File:2x4 Criston Cole Still.jpg|thumb|Overseeing the battle.]]
Their advance is halted when Meleys is spotted in the air, forcing the Greens to retreat back to the tree-line. Gwayne admonishes Criston that this is the exact reason he opposed a daytime attack, but Criston reveals this is part of his plan, ordering two of his archers to launch signal arrows. This alerts a series of soldiers deeper in the forest to blow horns that finally reach Aemond, signaling for him and [[Vhagar]] to enter the battle. At that same moment, Aegon flies overhead atop Sunfyre, having departed King's Landing earlier to personally join the battle, much to Aemond's fury, who subsequently stalls his own entry into the fray.

With Aegon's unexpected entry into the engagement throwing his plan into disarray, Criston orders for more signal arrows to be fired as he rallies the Green army to join their king into battle, boosting their morale and reversing the retreat caused by the levies with sending the rest of his army in to battle. As Criston's army presses forward toward Rook's Rest, Rhaenys spots Aegon and Sunfyre and orders Meleys to attack. Aegon begins the battle with a blast of fire, but Meleys evades and then attacks from below. The battle-tested Meleys quickly gains the upper hand over her inexperienced opponent, slashing Sunfyre's belly with her talons and sending the smaller dragon plummeting towards the ground, drenching soldiers below in boiling blood from his wounds. Sunfyre manages to stay aloft, but Meleys attacks again as he climbs back into the sky, clamping her jaws around Sunfyre's right wing and ignoring his frantic bites at her head to dislodge her.

Suddenly, they see Vhagar's enormous body emerge from the tree-line, much to the relief and awe of Criston and the Green army. As Meleys continues to assault Sunfyre, Rhaenys and Aegon both spot Aemond and Vhagar advancing on them. Initially relieved at his brother's intervention, Aegon becomes horrified as he realizes Aemond intends to attack both of them as Vhagar unleashes a blast of dragonfire. Rhaenys and Meleys manage to dodge the bulk of the blast, but Aegon and Sunfyre are struck head-on. Heavily injured, Sunfyre and Aegon free-fall from a high-altitude, crashing into the nearby forest with great force, much to Criston's horror, who rides off to the impact site.

As Criston's army attempts to flee, Meleys breaks loose just above the ground and flies off, while Vhagar crashes into the battlefield violently, crushing dozens, if not, hundreds of men in the process, and knocking Criston unconscious from the impact.

Sometime after Rhaenys and Meleys's death, Criston rouses from unconsciousness to the horrid sight of his decimated army and the burnt-out battlefield. In the distance, he sees Ser Gwayne rallying what little remains of the Green army to push through the breach created by Meleys's body and capture Rook's Rest. Criston proceeds to make his way through the carnage towards Aegon's crash site, attempting to enlist the aid of a soldier, only to discover the man is merely an incinerated skeleton that disintegrates at his touch. Criston eventually arrives at Aegon's crash site in the forest, spotting both a severely injured Sunfyre and Aemond approaching with his sword unsheathed. As Criston inquires on Aegon's location, Aemond wordlessly points forward with Aegon's [[Valyrian steel dagger]], revealing his motionless, shattered body with Sunfyre curled around him. Speechless, Criston collapses to his knees in shock as Aemond departs.

[[Criston Cole|Criston]] parades [[Meleys]]'s severed head through the [[King's Landing|city]], though he is baffled that the [[smallfolk]], near-starving due to the shipping [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]], consider it a bad omen and do not celebrate the [[Battle at Rook's Rest|victory]].
[[File:2x5 Alicent and Criston Still.jpg|thumb|Criston and Alicent following Aemond rise to regent.]]
[[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] has survived but is comatose and severely wounded, while [[Sunfyre]] is not expected to survive. Criston withholds telling [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] what part [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] played in the battle. Alicent nominates herself as [[regent]], citing her experience, but the [[Green Council|council]] instead elect Aemond, primarily due to his sex, saying that the choice demonstrates strength. Alicent confronts Criston furious about declaring Aemond as regent instead of her, but Cole describes her the horrifying situation during the battle of Rook's Rest and argues his choice with the words: ''"We have given the war to the dragons. A dragonrider should lead us."''

At a meeting of the [[Green Council|Small Council]], Aemond, having received Lord Jason's summons, furiously erupts at Tyland Lannister over his twin brother's arrogant audacity to summon him like a servant. Tyland attempts to defend his brother's decision by reminding Aemond of [[Caraxes]]'s presence at Harrenhal (against whom the Lannister host would be defenseless should [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] fly out to intercept them), but Aemond angrily orders Tyland to write back commanding Jason to march into the Riverlands, threatening Caraxes will become the least of Jason's problems if he disobeys.

[[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] tries to calm her son down, but Aemond talks over her, instructing Tyland to sail across the [[Narrow Sea]]<nowiki/>and negotiate with the [[Triarchy]] for naval power to break the [[blockade of the Gullet]]. The rest of the Small Council are aghast at this; Tyland and [[Criston Cole]] protest the dangers of allowing Triarchy military forces, whom they consider little better than pirates, so close to Westerosi waters, but Aemond is adamant, arguing that it will take the fleets of Houses [[House Lannister/House of the Dragon|Lannister]] and [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightower]] too long to sail around Westeros, whereas the Triarchy's fleets are much closer and would surely relish the opportunity to avenge their previous defeats at [[Corlys Velaryon]]'s hands. Alicent, reminding Aemond the [[War for the Stepstones|bloody battles fought in the Stepstones]] against the Triarchy during [[Viserys I Targaryen|his father]]'s reign prove their untrustworthiness, proposes an alliance with the [[ironborn]] as an alternative way to gain naval power, but [[Orwyle]] admits all his ravens to [[Dalton Greyjoy]] have gone unanswered. [[Jasper Wylde]] opines that Dalton is biding his time to see whether declaring for the [[Greens]] or [[Blacks]] will be more advantageous to him, proposing that they offer Alicent's hand in marriage to Dalton to sweeten the deal, but Alicent flatly vetoes any such proposal.

Aemond also orders Criston to muster their forces and march against Harrenhal. Criston protests, arguing that their army is so depleted by the casualties sustained at the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]] that if Daemon succeeds in rallying the Riverlords to his banner, Criston can't be sure of defeating him, urging they should wait until House Hightower's armies can arrive to reinforce them. Aemond overrules him, as it will take two weeks to march to Harrenhal and the longer they wait, the greater the risk Daemon will raise an army against them; Aemond assures Criston that once he and Jason have forced Daemon to fight on two fronts, he will fly out with Vhagar to join them and put an end to Daemon.
[[File:2x8 Criston Cole Still.jpg|thumb|Criston and his army camped on the march to Harrenhal. ]]
Criston and his troops are preparing to leave. Before Alicent can approach Criston, she is intercepted by [[Gwayne Hightower|her brother]], whom she quickly pretends was the object of her visit. Gwayne then mounts his horse and departs with Criston, who shares a glance with Alicent before leaving.

During the march toward [[Harrenhal]], [[Gwayne Hightower|Gwayne]] sees [[Criston Cole|Criston]] with [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s handkerchief and accuses him of breaking his [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] vows. Despondent, Criston expresses regret over past choices, telling Gwayne he believes they are headed towards annihilation by Rhaenyra's [[Dragon|dragons]].

==Personality==
Proud, strong, and honourable, Ser Criston carries himself as a noble should and has impeccable manners towards those he serves. Prodigious in his talent as a warrior, his strength and capability with the sword has earned the praise of everyone he has fought against, save for Daemon Targaryen. He is proud of his status as a knight of the Kingsguard, and considers being named to their order one of the greatest moments of his life.{{Guideref|Criston Cole}} His talent for martial skill was recognized early as he is one of the few people who has been able to get the better of Daemon Targaryen with sword and lance. His dutiful nature and skill also made him an early favourite of Princess Rhaenyra, and his handsome stature a point of gossip for most court ladies.

While he maintains a stoic demeanour on most occasions, Cole is prone sudden bursts of anger,{{Ref|HOTD105}}{{Ref|HOTD109}} and sometimes stammers when he speaks.{{Ref|HOTD105}} Under his exterior, Ser Criston is a stern and unbending man. He has taken all the oaths of the Kingsguard and his vows as a knight to a near literal degree, and considers breaking them to be a deep wound on his honour. He believes that acting on his own impulses and petty desires to be a stain on his character and unworthy of the office he holds. After killing [[Joffrey Lonmouth]], Criston was prepared to take his own life out of shame for his actions, considering them base and unbefitting of his station.{{Ref|HOTD105}} Inability to deal with his guilt and shame for having desires in conflict with his vows has made him quick to anger, and petty when he is unable to be made whole. When Rhaenyra rejected his marriage proposal, he became bitter and vengeful,{{Ref|HOTD106}} more than willing to spite her and her family should his vows allow for it.

Above all else, Criston regards his own honour and duty to the highest degree, with little ability to be flexible. His firm sense of duty drove him to propose an elopement with Rhaenyra and confessing his relationship to Alicent. It has also made him a fragile and somewhat broken man, who considers his shame and failures to be unforgivable.  After the [[assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen]], Criston confessed to Alicent that he felt there was no redemption for what he did, as he was abed with her, instead of being dutiful and on guard to prevent [[Blood]] and [[Cheese]] from taking the prince's life.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Cole goes through a change after participating and surviving the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]]. Having witnessed the true horrors of war, as well as the power and threat dragons pose has made him someone with less desire to fight in combat and defeat the enemy side. Losing control during the battle when his combat plan fails, facing several unforeseen events along the way—such as when Aegon flies onto the battlefield and is later burned by Aemond's dragon Vhagar, discovering that the Prince Targaryen wanted to kill his own brother, as well as the reactions from the commonfolk while doing a parade to show Meleys' corpse, has made Cole a less impulsive and  person and more cautious. He's also seemingly traumatized from all those events, which is seen when he desperately tries to clean up his sword covered by blood, refuses to talk about what happened to Aegon to Alicent, tries to persuade Aemond in waiting until his army can properly recover from the recent battle and protect Alicent by agreeing on naming Aemond the Regent while Aegon remains incapacitated.{{Ref|HOTD205}} He also says to Gwayne that he believes they're heading to annihilation by Rhaenyra's dragons.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Behind the scenes==
Criston Cole was revealed to be a recurring character in ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' on December 8, 2020. On April 15, 2021, [[HBO]] announced that [[Fabien Frankel]] had been cast in the role for the series. His character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] reads as follows:
:''"Of Dornish descent, the common-born son of the steward to the Lord of Blackhaven. Cole has no claim to land or titles; all he has to his name is his honor and his preternatural skill with a sword."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

His character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"The common-born son of the steward to the Lord of Blackhaven who has risen to be Lord Commander of the Kingsguard and Queen Alicent’s sworn protector."''{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros.

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Criston Cole was born the son of a steward to Lord Dondarrion of [[Blackhaven]], in the [[Dornish Marches]]. He had coal black hair and pale green eyes: combined with his prowess as the greatest living warrior in Westeros, many ladies at court found him charming. The books make no mention that he had some Dornish ancestry, though it is theoretically possible: the Dornish Marches are the border area between the [[Stormlands]], the [[Reach]], and Dorne, and control of the region has frequently changed hands over the centuries.

There are two conflicting sources about the relationship between Ser Criston and Rhaenyra, though according to both they never slept together: 

*According to Septon Eustace, after Viserys decided to wed Rhaenyra to Laenor Velaryon, Criston slipped into the princess's bedchamber, confessed his love for her, and begged her to elope with him across the narrow sea; Rhaenyra refused, reminding Criston that she was the blood of the dragon, and meant for more than to live out her life as the wife of a common sellsword. Eustace further posed the question "if he could set aside his Kingsguard vows, why would marriage vows mean any more to him?"
*According to Mushroom, it was Rhaenyra who went to Ser Criston, not the other way around. Twice she attempted to seduce him, using the "arts" she had learned from Daemon, but Criston was a man of honor and true to his vows, and would not be swayed.

However it happened, whether the princess spurned the knight or the other way around, since then the relationship between them went downhill. In a tournament held during the wedding celebrations of Laenor and Rhaenyra, [[Harwin Strong]] rode as Rhaenyra's champion. Ser Criston, furious that Rhaenyra bestowed her garter on Ser Harwin instead of him, took it out on the other competitors, resulting in the death of [[Joffrey Lonmouth]].
