{{Quote|When the snows fall and the white winds blow, the lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.|Eddard Stark|The Dragon and the Wolf}}
Lord '''Eddard Stark''', also known as '''Ned Stark''', was the head of [[House Stark]], the [[Lord of Winterfell]] and [[Warden of the North]], and later [[Hand of the King]] to [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon|Robert I Baratheon]]. He was the son of [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Rickard Stark]], older brother of [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]] and [[Lyanna Stark]], and the younger brother of [[Brandon Stark]]. He is the father of [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]], and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] by his wife, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]], and uncle of [[Jon Snow]], whom he raised as his [[bastard]] son. He was a dedicated husband and father, a loyal friend, and an honorable lord.

Eddard's [[Execution of Eddard Stark|execution]] and revelation of the illegitimacy of [[Cersei Lannister]]'s children sparked the [[War of the Five Kings]].

Despite his death, Eddard's legacy shaped the future of [[Westeros]] in the years that followed. His eldest son Robb was declared the first [[King in the North]] since the days of [[Aegon's Conquest]]. Although Robb later fell at the [[Red Wedding]], the North's desire for freedom was carried on by Jon's own rise as king following the [[Battle of the Bastards]]. Following the [[Last War]], a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]] elected Eddard's last living son, Bran, as the king of the new [[Six Kingdoms]], while his eldest daughter, Sansa, was crowned the Queen in the North.

==Biography==
===Background===
Eddard Stark was the head of [[House Stark]] and [[Warden of the North]], and House Stark is one of the [[Great House]]s of the realm. House Stark rules the region from their seat of [[Winterfell]], and Eddard also held the title [[Lord of Winterfell]].<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark entry]</ref>

[[File:Young Ned and Benjen Stark train at Winterfell..JPG|thumb|Ned and Benjen as children, training at Winterfell.|left]]
Eddard was the second son of Lord [[Rickard Stark]]. Lord Rickard served [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aerys II Targaryen]] as Warden of the North. Eddard's older brother [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]] was Rickard's heir. Eddard also has a younger sister [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] and a younger brother [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]]. Eddard was a stoic, dutiful, and honorable man and was considered to embody the values of the North.<ref name="Eddard viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/eddard-stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark - Eddard Stark entry]</ref>

Eddard was a trusted, close friend and counselor of King [[Robert Baratheon]].<ref name="Eddard viewers guide" /> Both boys were fostered as children by [[Jon Arryn]], the [[Defender of the Vale]], they grew to love each other as brothers and loved Jon Arryn as a father figure. He supported Robert's [[Robert's Rebellion|play for the throne]] by acting as a general in several major battles. Eddard's sister, Lyanna, who was betrothed to Robert, was purportedly [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapped]] by [[Prince of Dragonstone|Prince]] [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], igniting a war. Brandon protested the kidnapping, but his attempt to bring Rhaegar to justice failed. Lord Rickard was summoned to court in [[King's Landing]] by Aerys, and both Brandon and Rickard were brutally [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|executed]] by the Mad King.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/rickard-stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark - Rickard Stark entry]</ref> Their deaths left Eddard to inherit Rickard's responsibilities, serving King Robert instead.{{Cite}}

[[File:H&L207.png|thumb|Ned's wedding to Catelyn Tully.]]
Brandon had been betrothed to Catelyn, and Eddard also inherited his brother's bride.<ref name="Catelyn viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/catelyn-stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark - Catelyn Stark entry]</ref><ref name="Catelyn viewers guide" /><ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/brandon-stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark - Brandon Stark entry]</ref> Lyanna died in Eddard's arms during the conflict.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/lyanna-stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark - Lyanna Stark entry]</ref> Despite his happy family life, Eddard still felt the losses of his family quite keenly, often visiting his sister's tomb to light a candle for her as his daughter, Sansa, remembered.{{Ref|GOT504}} Despite barely knowing each other, Eddard and Catelyn formed a strong and loving marriage, and had five children, [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]].{{Ref|GOT101}}

Eddard also had a supposed [[Bastard|illegitimate]] son, [[Jon Snow]], apparently fathered with a common serving girl [[Wylla]], and raised Jon as his son alongside his legitimate children in Winterfell. In reality, Jon is Eddard's nephew since he is the son of Eddard's sister Lyanna with Rhaegar Targaryen. Eddard kept this secret from everyone, including Catelyn, to protect Jon - especially from Robert Baratheon. This would become a source of occasional friction between Eddard and Catelyn, who remained unaware of Jon's true origins. Eddard's younger brother Benjen joined the [[Night's Watch]], an institution of which Eddard was a keen supporter.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/benjen-stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark - Benjen Stark entry]</ref> He also appeared to have troubles keeping his bannermen in line as [[Stannis Baratheon]] remembered his brother Robert saying the Northmen were difficult to control, even with Eddard on his side.{{Ref|GOT502}}

Eddard wielded a [[Valyrian steel]] greatsword named [[Ice]] (an heirloom of House Stark) which he used on ceremonial occasions.{{Ref|GOT101}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Eddard 1x01.jpg|thumb|270x270px|Eddard passes sentence on Will.]]
Eddard Stark executes a deserter from the [[Night's Watch]] named [[Will]]. Will tries to warn Eddard about the return of the [[White Walkers]], but Eddard dismisses him as a madman. Eddard's sons [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]], and [[Jon Snow|Jon]] accompany him to the execution. Eddard makes a point of telling Bran that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword and take responsibility for his own decisions.{{Ref|GOT101}}

On the way back to [[Winterfell]], the party finds a dead stag and a dead female [[direwolf]]. The direwolf is found with her litter of six living pups. Eddard's first instinct is to kill them, but Jon tells his father that since the direwolf is the sigil of [[House Stark]], the pups may be an omen. Eddard agrees to let his children look after them on the condition that they clean, raise, and feed them with no help from the servants.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Winter_is_Coming_Robert_crypt_with_ned.jpg|thumb|Ned in the catacombs visiting Lyanna's crypt with Robert.]]
A [[raven]] bearing news of the death of [[Jon Arryn]], Eddard's childhood mentor and foster father, flies to Winterfell. The missive also states that King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and much of the royal court is on their way to the castle. Eddard realizes that Robert means to name him as [[Hand of the King]] to replace Jon. He ponders refusal. However, when Robert arrives, he makes it clear that he badly needs Eddard's help in [[King's Landing]]. He also sweetens the deal by offering to betroth his son and heir [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] to Eddard's daughter [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. Eddard remains uncertain until a secret letter from [[Lysa Arryn]], [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]'s sister, implicates the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] in the death of Jon Arryn. Eddard decides to accept to investigate both Jon Arryn's death and a potential plot against the king. He decides to bring both of his daughters to introduce them at court.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Eddard and Jon.jpg|thumb|Eddard and his nephew/adopted son Jon Snow.]]
Bran is found comatose at the base of a disused tower following an apparent climbing accident. Eddard reluctantly decides to leave as planned, to his wife's distress. Eddard, [[Arya Stark|Arya]], Sansa, and the royal party head south to [[King's Landing]]. At their parting, Eddard tells Jon he is a Stark and that while he does not have Eddard's name, he has his blood. He also promises to tell him about his [[Lyanna Stark|mother]] the next time they meet.{{Ref|GOT102}}

On the [[Kingsroad]] south to the capital, King Robert calls a halt to discuss troubling news from [[Essos]]. Robert's spies have learned of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s marriage to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]], whose ''[[khalasar]]'' is reported to number over one hundred thousand warriors. Eddard points out that the [[Dothraki]] cannot cross the [[Narrow Sea]], as they have no ships, but Robert is concerned that the Seven Kingdoms will soon face another war. Robert also asks about Wylla, the mother of Jon Snow, but Eddard quickly deflects the line of questioning.{{Ref|GOT102}}

[[File:Ned and Arya.jpg|thumb|Eddard and Arya at the Crossroads Inn.]]
Joffrey is bitten by Arya's direwolf [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]] after Joffrey attacks Arya. To save Nymeria's life, Arya forces her direwolf to flee and hides in the woods herself. Arya is found and Eddard is brought before the king and instructed to punish Arya. Joffrey lies about the cause of the incident and Sansa supports him, enraging Arya. [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] insists that a direwolf must be punished and Robert orders that Sansa's direwolf, [[Lady]], must be killed in Nymeria's place. Eddard attends to the matter himself, to Sansa's anger.{{Ref|GOT102}}

[[File:Arya, Ned and Syrio 1x03.jpg|thumb|Ned hires Syrio Forel to train Arya.]]
On his arrival in King's Landing, Eddard is immediately summoned to a [[Small Council]] meeting and finds the capital immersed in political intrigue. Members of the king's [[Small Council]] are at the heart of these machinations: [[Petyr Baelish]], the [[Master of Coin]], known as Littlefinger; [[Varys]], the [[Master of Whisperers]]; [[Pycelle]], the [[Grand Maester]]; and [[Renly Baratheon]], the [[Master of Laws]] and Robert's younger brother. Eddard learns that the crown is six million [[Money|gold dragons]] in debt, with half of it owed to Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. Regardless, Robert has ordered a lavish [[tournament]] to celebrate Eddard's appointment.
While acclimating to the political maneuvering, Eddard also tries to repair the rift between Sansa and Arya with mixed results. Sansa rejects his gifts, but Arya is delighted when he hires a swordmaster, [[Syrio Forel]], to train her.{{Ref|GOT103}}

Littlefinger tells Eddard that Catelyn has followed him to the city. Eddard is furious when Littlefinger brings him to a brothel, believing he is the victim of a bad joke. Catelyn intervenes as Eddard attacks Littlefinger. She tells Eddard that she has traveled south to report an assassination attempt against Bran. The assassin was killed but was carrying a Valyrian steel knife. Littlefinger identifies the blade as one that he lost in a bet with [[Tyrion Lannister]], and they conclude that the Lannisters were also behind Bran's original injuries. Eddard agrees to try to expose the truth, and Catelyn urges him to trust Littlefinger, her childhood friend. Eddard reluctantly agrees, though he finds Littlefinger obnoxious and dishonorable.{{Ref|GOT103}}

[[File:Small Council.png|thumb|Eddard presides over the Small Council.]]
Eddard's investigation reveals that Jon Arryn took an interest in Robert's numerous bastard children, including his son [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]. He learns that Jon borrowed ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' from Pycelle. Eddard reads the book but cannot determine why Jon wanted it. Eddard discovers that soon after Jon's death his squire, [[Hugh of the Vale]], was knighted. Eddard sends the captain of his guards, [[Jory Cassel]], to investigate, but Hugh refuses to talk to Jory.
Hugh is killed by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] - a noted servant of Lord Tywin Lannister - in an apparent tourney mishap before Eddard can talk to him.{{Ref|GOT104}} As the tourney continues, Eddard discusses the death with [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] [[Barristan Selmy]] of the [[Kingsguard]], one of the most decorated and honorable knights in Westeros. They cannot ascertain if Hugh was killed deliberately. Eddard convinces King Robert not to fight in the tourney, bluntly calling him too fat. Robert reluctantly agrees.{{Ref|GOT105}}

[[Yoren]] of the Night's Watch arrives in the city and tells Eddard that he witnessed Catelyn arresting Tyrion Lannister. This allows Eddard to claim that he ordered the arrest. Varys visits Eddard and warns him that there is a conspiracy, saying that Jon was poisoned and that King Robert may also be killed if Eddard cannot stop it.{{Ref|GOT105}}

A rift opens between Eddard and Robert when Eddard refuses to sanction the assassination of [[Daenerys Targaryen]] upon hearing she is pregnant with ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]]'s [[Rhaego|child]]. Eddard resigns as Hand and prepares to return to Winterfell. Littlefinger gives Eddard another lead, keeping him in the city. Eddard finds another of Robert's bastards, a baby girl named [[Barra]] in one of Littlefinger's brothels. As Eddard leaves the brothel, he is confronted by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] over Tyrion's capture. Jaime kills Jory and Eddard's other bodyguards. He proceeds to engage Eddard in single combat. A Lannister guardsman interferes and stabs Eddard in the leg, angering Jaime. He tells Eddard that he wants his [[Tyrion Lannister|brother]] back and leaves.{{Ref|GOT105}}

An injured Eddard wakes up in the [[Red Keep]] to be confronted by Cersei and Robert about the fight with Jaime and the abduction of Tyrion by Catelyn. Cersei is enraged that Eddard will not be punished. Robert tells Eddard that he is like a brother, and he refuses to accept his resignation as Hand. Robert commands Eddard to take back the badge and to make peace with the Lannisters, as he will not risk another civil war. Eddard reluctantly agrees. Robert goes on a hunting expedition, and Eddard receives word that Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] is leading a series of pillaging raids on the [[Riverlands]], possibly at Lord Tywin Lannister's command. Despite his order to make peace with the Lannisters, Eddard commands Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] to carry out an order of execution on Gregor, whom he [[Attainder|strips]] of all rank and title. Eddard also orders that Tywin present himself in the capital to explain his vassal's actions under penalty of being branded a traitor.{{Ref|GOT106}}

[[File:Eddard and the book.jpg|thumb|Ned discovers the parentage of Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen.]]
Despite being restored to the king's favor, Eddard worries that the situation may yet come to war. He orders Sansa and Arya to return to Winterfell. A chance comment by Sansa that golden-haired Joffrey is a lion, not a stag, and is "nothing like" his old drunk of a father, prompts Eddard to realize the truth of Joffrey's parentage. He consults ''The Lineage'' book and sees that in every match between a Baratheon and a member of another house, the Baratheon black hair always dominates. Shocked, Eddard realizes that this means that Joffrey and the other royal children are not Robert's and as a result, they have no claim to the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

[[File:Eddard and Cersei 1x07.png|thumb|181x181px|Ned confronts Cersei.]]
Eddard confronts Cersei and warns her that he knows that her three children are not Robert's children, but her children conceived with her twin brother Jaime. Ned warns Cersei to flee with her children into exile before Robert returns from his hunt, when he will tell Robert the truth. Robert [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|is mortally wounded]] while on the hunt. Wishing him a peaceful death, Eddard withholds his discovery. Robert has Eddard write his will, naming Eddard [[Protector of the Realm]] to rule until [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] comes of age. Eddard transcribes the command, but does not name Joffrey specifically and instead refers to Robert's successor as Robert's rightful heir.{{Ref|GOT107}}

Eddard writes to Robert's brother and true heir, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], urging him to take the crown. He dispatches his guardsman [[Tomard]] to deliver the letter. Eddard tells Littlefinger the truth of the matter, but rejects Littlefinger's suggestion that they take advantage of the situation to increase their own power. Reluctantly, Littlefinger agrees to recruit the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] to Eddard's cause. Renly also offers Eddard the use of soldiers in securing Cersei and her children, but Eddard refuses to dishonor Robert's last few hours by spilling blood and frightening children. Renly flees the castle fearing that the Lannisters will show no such respect.{{Ref|GOT107}}

[[File:Eddard and Petyr 1x07.png|thumb|Littlefinger turns on Eddard Stark.]]
Robert dies and Joffrey takes the throne. Cersei tears up the letter proclaiming Eddard as Protector of the Realm. Eddard tells Joffrey that he has no right to the Iron Throne and commands the City Watch to take him and his mother into custody. Instead, the City Watch turns on Eddard's men and kills them. Littlefinger holds a knife to Eddard's throat, telling him that he shouldn't have trusted him.{{Ref|GOT107}}

[[File:Ned 1x09.png|thumb|Eddard in the black cells of the Red Keep.]]
Eddard is incarcerated in the black cells under the Red Keep. He is visited by Varys who is disguised as a gaoler. Eddard asks about his daughters and Varys replies Arya has escaped the castle but Sansa is still engaged to Joffrey. Varys is bemused by Eddard telling Cersei that he knew about the parentage of her children and adds that his mercy is what killed Robert. He also informs Ned that Catelyn no longer has Tyrion in custody. Eddard asks if he will be killed and Varys replies, "not today."{{Ref|GOT108}} Varys returns to urge Eddard to confess to treason in exchange for exile in the [[Night's Watch]]. Eddard refuses until Varys elucidates that the Lannisters still have Sansa as a hostage. Varys adds that the Lannisters need him alive so they can bargain with his son Robb, who is leading an army to confront them in the [[Riverlands]].{{Ref|GOT109}}

[[File:Ned's execution.jpg|thumb|Eddard is executed by Ser Ilyn Payne.]]
Eddard is taken to the front steps of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. He spots Arya crouching beside the statue of [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]] and signals [[Yoren]], who is also present amidst the gathered crowd. Having relented to Varys' request in order to save Sansa, Eddard makes the false confession that he intended to seize the throne for himself and recognizes Joffrey as the rightful king. Joffrey, however, ignores his mother's counsel that Eddard be exiled and orders his immediate execution. Before Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] swings the Lord of Winterfell's own sword [[Ice]], Eddard notices that Yoren has taken Arya. Sansa, distraught, is restrained as Payne decapitates Eddard before the shocked Cersei and council can intervene while the baying crowd cheers. Before he dies, Eddard mutters a few last unheard words.{{Ref|GOT109}} Yoren is able to smuggle a devastated Arya out of the city.{{Ref|GOT110}}

[[File:Eddard's Head.png|thumb|Eddard's head on a spike.]]
Eddard's head is placed on a spike above the Traitor's Walk in the [[Red Keep]]. Joffrey torments Sansa by forcing her to look upon it as well as the other slain members of her household. She overcomes her revulsion and is able to maintain her composure, preventing his satisfaction at seeing her upset. Eddard's death launches the Seven Kingdoms into the devastating [[War of the Five Kings]], with the North and the Riverlands seceding from the authority of the Iron Throne and Robb Stark proclaimed as the [[King in the North]]. Tywin calls his execution "madness and stupidity" as the Lannisters - who are also fighting Robert's brothers for the throne - could have used Eddard to end the war with the Starks.{{Ref|GOT110}}

[[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] is held hostage by the Lannisters and forced to call her father a traitor.{{Ref|GOT201}}

The return of Ned's remains for a proper burial is one of the demands that his son [[Robb Stark]], the new [[King in the North]], tells [[Alton Lannister]] to deliver to Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] in King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT201}}

Cersei scoffs at Robb's declaration of independence when his demands are read to the [[Small Council]], but [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] insists that they should at least return the bones of Robb's father.{{Ref|GOT202}}

When [[Catelyn Stark]] approaches the camp of [[Renly Baratheon]], his wife [[Margaery Tyrell]] says she is sorry for her loss. When [[Catelyn Stark]] and [[Petyr Baelish]] both approach the army camp of [[Renly Baratheon]] in the [[Stormlands]] for negotiations, Baelish delivers Ned's bones to Catelyn, in a box escorted by a pair of [[Silent Sisters]]. The delivery is a gesture of goodwill by Tyrion, in the hope that this would smooth the way to achieving the liberation of his brother Jaime from Stark captivity. Catelyn mourns over Ned's remains.{{Ref|GOT204}}

Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] berates [[Theon Greyjoy]] for his betrayal when Theon takes Winterfell, reminding him that Ned raised him among his family. Theon responds, "Among them, but not one of them." Ser Rodrik laments what if Ned were alive to see this but Theon tells Rodrik that Ned is dead. As [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] plead for Rodrik's life and the Ironborn urge Theon to execute Rodrik, Rodrik assures Bran and Rickon that he’s off to see their father.{{Ref|GOT206}}

Beyond the Wall, [[Jon Snow|Jon]] reveals to the [[Free Folk|wildling]] [[Ygritte]] who he is, that Ned Stark is his father, and his family has the blood of the [[First Men]] in their veins like Ygritte and the other wildlings do as the Starks and wildlings are both descendants of the First Men.{{Ref|GOT207}}

[[Mance Rayder]] recognizes Jon as "Ned Stark's bastard." In their conversation, Jon remembers his father taught him that "big men fall just as quick as little ones."{{Ref|GOT301}}

[[Bran Stark|Bran]] has a dream at one point where he hears his father's voice, repeating his previous words of encouragement that Bran will become a better archer with practice, and scolding [[Jon Snow|Jon]] and [[Robb Stark|Robb]] for laughing at Bran missing the bullseye.{{Ref|GOT302}}

When Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] urges Sansa to tell her the truth about [[Joffrey Baratheon]], Sansa answers her father always told the truth but he was proclaimed a traitor and Joffrey cut his head off. Sansa reveals how Joffrey forced her to look at her father's decapitated head. When Olenna tells her to go on, Sansa panics and tries to take back what she said but confesses Joffrey is a monster after Olenna assures her they will keep her confidence.{{Ref|GOT302}}

[[Jojen Reed]] tells Bran that when he told [[Howland Reed|his father]] that he saw [[Execution of Eddard Stark|Ned’s execution]] in his [[Sight|visions]], it was the first time he saw his father cry. Bran realizes Jojen's father is Howland Reed and tells Jojen that Howland saved Ned's life in the Rebellion.{{Ref|GOT302}}

In a conversation with Lady Olenna, [[Varys]] states that he admired Lord Eddard, and Lady Olenna retorts that Lord Stark had many admirers, none of which came to his rescue, not knowing that Varys had tried and failed to have Ned spared. Varys replies that he regrets he was unable to save Ned from execution, and that he wishes to help Sansa as a means of restitution for this failure.{{Ref|GOT304}}

[[Theon Greyjoy]], after reflecting on his betrayal of the Starks and his abandonment by his father, comes to the conclusion that Ned Stark was the closest thing to a father he ever had, realizing that his "real father died in King's Landing", which he confesses to [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]]. The realization that he had betrayed Ned's memory and the only people who ever truly treated him like family moves Theon to tears.{{Ref|GOT304}}

During her time with the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]] learns from [[Thoros]] that they were indirectly created by her father to bring justice to Gregor Clegane.

Shortly before they are [[Red Wedding|massacred]] at the wedding of [[Edmure Tully]] and [[Roslin Tully|Roslin Frey]], [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and his wife [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]] consider naming their unborn child after Ned if it is a boy.

Bran later returns to the vision of the Tower of Joy, picking up from Ned entering the tower. He arrives at a room where he sees her sister Lyanna lying in a bed and a slice in her stomach. Ned calls the present maidens for help but Lyanna stops him and tells him to take care of her recently born son, fathered by Rhaegar. Lyanna whispers to her brother that her son's name is Aegon Targaryen and pleads for Ned to promise that he'll protect her child, knowing that [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] will kill her son if he finds out of his Targaryen blood. As Ned takes her baby into his arms, Lyanna passes away. To protect his sister's son from Robert, Ned returns to Winterfell with his infant nephew, names him '[[Jon Snow|Jon]]',<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1202/ So Spake Martin, February 28, 2002]</ref> and claims him as his own illegitimate son, raising Jon as his own child alongside his trueborn children.{{Ref|GOT610}}{{Ref|GOT707}}

{{Quote|I'll say this for Ned Stark: He's serious enough.|Cersei Lannister to Robert Baratheon, regarding Eddard Stark.|The Wolf and the Lion}}
Eddard Stark was a man of principle, being patient, cautious, intelligent, noble and possessing an immense sense of duty. He was remembered profusely for being extremely honorable and a firmly moral character at heart. He always reacted to situations calmly and reasonably, even if the situations endangered him or the people he loved. He was a skilled and fierce warrior but certainly preferred the diplomatic and peaceful solution to situations, even if that solution was martial law. He, himself, remarked that he didn't fear death, and recollected that he grew up with soldiers - Cersei elaborated that Eddard's older brother Brandon was born to lead, whilst ''he'' was born to follow. In his own words, Ned explained that he "learned how to die a long time ago." Ned viewed situations and individuals by the scope of their moral compass, and judged almost everything on that perspective. He also speculated the concept that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, showing that he can be pragmatic in his sense of honor. In spite of that, he was not narrow-minded and did not appear prejudiced, arrogant or self-serving.

[[File:Ned Stark vs Jaime Lannister.jpg|thumb|Eddard Stark fights Jaime Lannister.]]
Ned was a very loving father to all of his children, including Jon Snow, his "bastard son", even though Catelyn was of a different opinion. He was very patient with Sansa's dreamy notions, visibly tolerating her adoration of the idea that she'd marry a handsome prince. When he tried to point out to her that Joffrey lacked bravery, strength of character, and even morality, a 13-year old Sansa was unable to see the truth at the time. He had a strong relationship with Arya, and was one of the few who could tolerate her feisty, adventurous mentality, and even encouraged it. He was, in many ways, like his son Robb, in that his sense of honor and duty ruled every aspect of his being, and he was a charismatic leader to those who served him. Ned had good relationships with both Robb and Jon Snow, the latter who Ned raised as his own alongside his lawful children. Like Robb, Jon inherited Ned’s traits of honor and duty. Ned treated Jon as his son - regardless of his legitimacy, and despite Jon being his nephew, not his son by blood. Ned was willing to sacrifice his own honor to protect Jon, and spent years letting everyone - including his whole family - believe that Jon was his bastard son to ensure Jon's protection. Ned also took responsibility on Catelyn's actions, claiming he had ordered the arrest of Tyrion Lannister even though he had no idea until confronted, this proves that Ned was capable of sacrifice his honor in order to protect his family.{{Ref|GOT106}}  Ned's death provoked such a brutal reaction from all of his family because they all loved him more than words could say.

Eddard was proficient in combat, both in strategy and in a duel. He killed Ser Gerold Hightower, survived the Battle of the Trident where he cut down a dozen knights and held his own impressively against the younger Jaime Lannister. He had earned the respect of men like Ser Arthur Dayne, the greatest warrior of his generation - indeed, Ned's sense of honor seemed to impress everyone around him, including the rigid and cold Stannis Baratheon, the sharp tongued Olenna Tyrell, and the cunning Varys. Aside from being selfless, dutiful and brave, he was slow to anger and thus he was one of the very, very few who could withstand the temper and misgivings of Robert Baratheon, with whom he shared a relationship that was a hair's breadth from being considered a brotherly one. Robert admitted that he lacked love for Stannis and Renly Baratheon, and had instead called Ned his brother, showing that Robert's admiration for his old comrade was tremendous. Ned's calm and reasonable mentality was respected firmly by Robert, who recognized that Ned was the only one who would dare say no to him for the right reasons. Robert obviously trusted Ned, begging him on his deathbed to help Joffrey in a way that Robert himself had failed and even naming the man as Protector of the Realm until Joffrey came of age.

However, he had the fatal weakness of being a poor politician, preferring to take the honorable route than doing what would politically benefit him - Cersei speculated that, in the ''game of thrones'', one had to take what was in arm's reach or be damned, but Ned disagreed because the fight he fought was never to survive, but to preserve the lives of those he loved. Despite being usually straightforward, his honor could oftentimes blind him to reason, leading him to make highly impractical decisions and judgments. While intelligent, he wasn't the most imaginative person, which further exacerbated by his rigid sense of honor, made him unable to compromise or consider alternatives, usually going with the simplest and most straightforward course of action. Perhaps the best example is how he confronted Cersei about her children being fathered by Cersei's twin brother Jaime and not by Robert Baratheon. To save Cersei's children, whom he viewed as innocent and undeserving of punishment, he had proposed exile, even though it was obvious (to anyone with common sense) that Cersei would not accept Ned's offer - which meant giving up her power position and luxurious life and becoming a fugitive vagabond; instead, having already plotted Robert's death before Ned's confrontation, she told him to bend the knee to her son Joffrey and then arrested Ned when he refused.

One of Eddard's main flaws was his blunt, tactless attitude (similarly to Stannis). He failed to understand that "you catch more flies with honey rather than with vinegar." The best example for that is the manner he expressed his opinion about the suggestion to assassinate Daenerys: by acting so bluntly and disrespectfully toward Robert, Eddard only managed to anger him and make him stick to his decision. It never occurred to Eddard that he should have taken a different approach, like the way Davos tried to dissuade his king on similar circumstances (in the novels{{Bookref|ASOS|54}}): talk with the king in private, calmly and softly, appeal to his conscience. Eventually, Robert did regret his decision, but by then it was too late.

Eddard often evaluated matters and people by the evidence he saw with his own eyes, rarely ever looking underneath the surface or at the bigger picture. This made him a poor judge of character and he had a bad habit of trusting people, which was a mistake he disastrously made with Petyr Baelish. He also did not predict that Cersei Lannister would be unreasonable enough to turn down his offer of mercy if and when Robert found out that Joffrey, Tommen, and Myrcella weren't his children; a mistake that cost Ned not just his own life, but set off a chain of events that has also so far led to the deaths of his wife, two of his sons and many other lives. Finally, he near-automatically judged Jaime to have betrayed his king for dishonorable reasons the moment he discovered the Kingslayer sitting on the Iron Throne with the Mad King's corpse lying at his feet, without asking the knight his side of the story and despite the fact he was a rebel himself. Still, Jaime's arrogance did nothing to dispel this misconception.

Occasionally, Ned could be self-righteous in his honor, acting as an "honorable fool", as Robert called him. He was quick to judge Jaime's actions as dishonorable, despite himself publicly proclaiming to have sired a child out of wedlock with another woman, which he did in order to protect his nephew (Lyanna's son Jon Snow, birth name Aegon Targaryen) from Robert's wrath. He also accused Jaime of sticking to his Kingsguard vows when his family was being tortured and murdered by Aerys, something he did not do when meeting Barristan Selmy. He also had a tendency to choose personal honor over his duties as a leader of millions, ignoring pragmatic decisions for ones that would allow him to maintain his dignity, even at the potential danger of those he swore to protect (though he usually believed that he'd be capable of warding off the threats). This could be seen in the way he chose to deal with Cersei, and his refusal to participate in Daenerys's assassination, in spite of the immense threat her brother and the Dothraki presented to the Seven Kingdoms (which indeed has been realized, several years later, in an [[Battle of King's Landing|extremely devastating manner]]).

Furthermore, as he "grew up with soldiers", he tended to put a lot of faith in the mindset and capabilities of efficient warriors and commanders in many matters. Ned had told his illegitimate son (revealed to be nephew) Jon that true friendship is made on the battlefield. This sometimes caused him to ignore personality aspects that would have a negative effect in certain situations. He was unable to predict that Robert, despite having been his best friend, did not have the attributes required to make an effective king. Ned's belief in the importance of martial skill is supported when he stated to Renly that he believed Stannis's military accomplishments would help make him an efficient monarch.

Ned was also very stubborn, obsessed with doing things in the "right way". When he learned the truth about Joffrey and his siblings he had the intention of telling to Robert what he'd discovered and attempting to give the throne to Stannis, due to being the rightful heir, despite fully knowing this would start a power struggle inside of the realm. He also attempted to arrest Cersei and all her children and take them into custody even though this act could be seen as treason. He even refused to accept the advice Varys gave him about kneeling and accepting Joffrey as the legitimate king, also ignoring the fact that his own daughter begged for his life. This proved how far Ned'd go to stick to his principles and moral standards to the point of choosing his own death rather than swallow his pride and break his honorable code.

Despite his principles, Eddard was not above acting selfishly, with disregard to other people's lives: when he was first told about Tyrion's kidnapping, he did absolutely nothing to defuse the situation - although he knew well that the Lannisters would never dismiss such offense, and innocent lives would be undoubtedly lost as a result. He had two more opportunities to resolve the matter peacefully (when confronting Jaime and Robert), but chose to pour oil on the flames by falsely claiming that Catelyn acted at his command. Eddard's pride cost many lives - among them Jory, Wyl, Heward, and residents of the Riverlands.

*[[Gáspár Szabó]] was a stunt double for [[Sean Bean]] in the role of Eddard Stark.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Eddard Stark is in his mid-thirties when the story begins. He has a reputation for chivalry, honor, honesty, and command, but can also sometimes be remote. He has a frosty relationship with Jaime, believing that the latter should have been, at the very least, stripped of his rank in the Kingsguard for his murder of the former king. A stoic yet fair and caring man, Eddard puts a great deal of importance on his family.

In contrast to the show, when Robert asked Eddard to replace Jon Arryn as Hand of the King, Ned wanted to decline, but went south at his wife's urging to investigate Arryn's death.

Eddard is also an accomplished battlefield commander, leading armies in [[Robert's Rebellion]] and the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. However, the books make no particular mention of his skills with a sword, other than the rumor of him killing Arthur Dayne in single combat. The books do mention his brother's swordsmanship skills, which were most likely condensed into Ned for the TV show.

Unlike the show, Ned's bones are sent to Riverrun as part of a plot orchestrated by Tyrion to free Jaime. Afterward, Catelyn assigns a retinue of Stark men, under the command of [[Hallis Mollen]], to deliver them to Winterfell. However, with [[Moat Cailin]] held by the [[ironborn]], the whereabouts of the retinue and their cargo remains unknown. [[Barbrey Dustin|Lady Dustin]], who resents Ned (even after his death) for not bringing her late husband's bones to be buried in his ancestral home, intends to pay Ned back by feeding his bones to her dogs.

The [[Faith of the Seven]] are outraged that Ned's execution was performed on the steps of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], believing this act of bloodshed profaned the holy grounds, and marks the beginning of a deterioration in relations between the crown and the Faith.

Daenerys, who has not been told yet the whole ugly truth about her father and the atrocities he committed during his reign (among them the execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark), loathes and resents Ned; in her eyes, the "cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart" was one the "Usurper's dogs" alongside the Lannisters, and that he was a traitor who met a traitor's end. Jorah Mormont assures Daenerys that Ned was not a traitor,{{Bookref|ACOK|27}} although he rebelled against her father, and Selmy tells her that Ned objected to Robert's decision to assassinate her{{Bookref|ADWD|11}} - but she does not change her mind about Ned.
