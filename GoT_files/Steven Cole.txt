'''Steven Cole''' (born 18 March 1982, in Liverpool, UK) is a British actor and model. He is best known for playing the role of Leo Johnson on the popular British soap opera ''[[wikipedia:Brookside|Brookside]]'' from 1996 to 2001. He has also appeared in the British TV series ''[[wikipedia:Merseybeat (TV series)|Merseybeat]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]''.

It was revealed via Twitter on 7 September that Cole had been cast in a role on ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', debuting in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]]. Initially, the role he was playing was not revealed.<ref>[https://twitter.com/#!/StevenCole_/status/110969103845556224 Steven Cole's Twitter]</ref> On 15 September it was confirmed he was playing the role of [[Kovarro]].<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Steven_Cole_is..._Kovarro/ Westeros.org]</ref> He joined the cast as a guest star in the second season.

The TV series seems to have basically switched the descriptions of the book characters [[Rakharo]] and Jhogo, and then renamed the character "Kovarro". In the TV series, it is Rakharo who shows proficiency with a whip, and is relatively young, like Jhogo/Kovarro in the books. Meanwhile, Jhogo/Kovarro in the TV series is now (slightly) older than TV-Rakharo, and it is Kovarro who has a moustache. Thus the TV series character "Kovarro" corresponds to the book-version of Rakharo. Besides this name switch, the two characters are not particularly different from their characterization in the books.
