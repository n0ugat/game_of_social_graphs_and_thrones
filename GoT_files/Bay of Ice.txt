The '''Bay of Ice'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a large bay off the north-western coast of the continent of [[Westeros]]. It is part of the [[Sunset Sea]]. [[Bear Island]] lies within the Bay. Its northern coast is the [[Frozen Shore]], held by the [[Free Folk|wildlings]]. Its eastern edge meets the southern reaches of the [[Frostfangs]]. Its southern edge is the coastland north of the [[Wolfswood]]. [[Sea Dragon Point]] projects into the southern opening of the Bay.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Bay of Ice is a large bay in the North that is bordered by the Frozen Shore to the north and Sea Dragon Point to the south. Bear Island sits within the bay. Wildling raiders from the Frozen Shore sometimes raid across the Bay of Ice, attacking both Bear Island and the lands around [[Deepwood Motte]]. The [[ironborn]] at the height of their power were able to send [[Iron Fleet|longships]] into the Bay of Ice and controlled Bear Island for several centuries until losing it in a wrestling match to the [[King in the North]], who gifted it to a loyal retainer (who became the founder of [[House Mormont]]).
