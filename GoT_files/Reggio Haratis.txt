Prince '''Reggio Haratis''' is the [[Prince of Pentos]] during the [[War for the Stepstones]] and the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
Haratis is the nominal ruler of the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Pentos]], elected by the [[magister]]s to act as the city's figurehead. He is an ally of [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Laena Velaryon]]. He owns a manse overlooking the city of Pentos.{{Guideref|Reggio Haratis}}

Haratis allows [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] and his wife [[Laena Velaryon|Laena]] to live as honored guests in his manse, hoping that their presence acts as a deterrent to the [[Triarchy]] to the south. One day, Haratis reveals to them that the Triarchy has launched a new campaign into the Stepstones, allying with [[Qoren Martell]] of Dorne, and offers them a permanent residence in Pentos and land in exchange for their support against the Triarchy.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Daemon and Laena are mentioned to have been hosted by the Prince of Pentos, but his name is not given. Gessio Haratis, a Pentoshi historian mentioned in ''The World of Ice & Fire'', shares his surname.
