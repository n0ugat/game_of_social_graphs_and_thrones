==Behind the scenes==
While Maelor has not yet appeared in ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' or the [[House of the Dragon Official Guide|Official Guide]], he is included in the [[Opening credits (House of the Dragon: Season 1)|opening credits]] of [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] as one of three children of Aegon and Helaena who are represented by a six-fingered hand. [[Ryan Condal]] has confirmed that Maelor has not yet been born within the timeline of the TV series.{{Webref|name=EW |author=Nick Romano |date=June 16, 2024 |url=https://ew.com/blood-cheese-house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-changes-explained-exclusive-8663564 |title=Blood and Cheese speak! Inside ''House of the Dragon'' season 2's gruesome moment (exclusive) |website=Entertainment Weekly |access-date=June 17, 2024}}

In "[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]," Aegon confesses to [[Larys Strong]] that his [[Battle at Rook's Rest|fall]] at [[Rook's Rest]] had [[Eunuch|destroyed]] his genitals, making it all but certain that Maelor will never be born during the series.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

According to [[George R.R. Martin]], Ryan Condal initially planned for Maelor to be born in Season 3. However, Martin speculated that this plan changed during Season 2, and Maelor will simply never be born at all.{{Webref|name=Butterflies |author=George R.R.
