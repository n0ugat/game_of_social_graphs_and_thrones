Lord '''Gormon Peake'''{{Con|D&EN}} is the head of [[House Peake]].

==In the books==
In the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Gormon is a veteran of the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], in which he fought for [[Daemon Blackfyre]] and killed Lord Hayford and Roger of Pennytree at the [[Battle of Redgrass Field|Battle of the Redgrass Field]]. After the battle, he surrendered and was pardoned by King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]] at the price of his castles Dunstonbury and Whitegrove, leaving him only Starpike. [[Arlan of Pennytree]], Roger's uncle, mentioned Gormon to his squire [[Duncan the Tall|Dunk]] but could not recall his name.

Gormon's name is a reference to the ''Gormenghast'' trilogy written by Mervyn Peake.
