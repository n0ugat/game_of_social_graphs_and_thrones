A '''wounded Lannister soldier''' was a fisherman's son from [[Lannisport]], before he was conscripted into a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] force led by Ser [[Stafford Lannister]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
He participates in the [[Battle of Oxcross]], in which his leg is wounded, and is taken captive. He is treated by [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]]. Though he begs for her not to, she amputates the leg, telling him that not doing so would kill him. [[Robb Stark|Robb]], who noticed Talisa, helps to hold him down, forcing him to bite down on a piece of leather. Afterward, he is loaded onto a cart and taken away.{{Ref|GOT204}}

Talisa blames Robb for the boy losing his leg, explaining that he isn't responsible for the death of [[Eddard Stark]] and isn't friends with King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], and that he was a fisherman's son before they forced a spear in his hand. Robb tells Talisa that the boy was lucky she was there, but she says he was unlucky Robb was.{{Ref|GOT204}}
