Lord '''Steffon Baratheon''' was the [[Lord of Storm's End]] and head of [[House Baratheon]]. He is the father of [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], and [[Renly Baratheon]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Steffon Baratheon was the third member of House Baratheon to be named Steffon. He was the Lord of Storm's End and head of House Baratheon, one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. He is the father of Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon. He lived with his family at [[Storm's End]]. Steffon fought in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]] alongside his father, [[Ormund Baratheon]], who, according to singers, died in the arms of Steffon.{{Ref|H&L604}}

While in a drunken stupor, he once attempted to violate the honor of a noble lady but was subdued by Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]]{{Note|The paragraph mentioning this event is erroneously placed in Arthur Dayne's entry. The opening sentence calling him the "thirdborn son to Lord Symon of House Gaunt" makes it apparent that this paragraph was meant for Gwayne Gaunt's entry.|name=Gwayne Gaunt}} of the [[Kingsguard]], though he was spared on account of his drunkenness.{{Ref|GOT806}}

Steffon and his wife, [[Cassana Baratheon|Cassana]], died shortly before [[Robert's Rebellion]] when their ship, the ''[[Windproud]]'', sank in [[Shipbreaker Bay]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] mentions that his father used to tell him that "boredom indicates a lack of inner resources".{{Ref|GOT504}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Steffon is mentioned under the entry of Ser Arthur Dayne{{Note|name=Gwayne Gaunt}} in the ''[[Book of Brothers]]'', which the new [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth]] flicks through.{{Ref|GOT806}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Steffon Baratheon was the son of Lord Ormund Baratheon and Rhaelle Targaryen, the sister of King Jaehaerys II and aunt of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. Despite what maesters claim, this relationship is not what allowed Robert to claim the [[Iron Throne]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]]; he seized the Iron Throne by force.
[[File:Ormund and Steffon Baratheon.png|thumb|220x220px|Steffon holds his father Ormund fallen in battle.]]
Steffon Baratheon appears to have been an effective lord. He was once defeated by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] during a [[tournament]]. He was sent by King Aerys II to the [[Free Cities]] to find a bride for Prince Rhaegar, but he found no suitable matches. He did find a talented fool, however, one whom he believed would teach even Stannis to laugh. However, Lord Steffon's ship, the ''Windproud'', sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End. His body and that of his wife, Lady Cassana of House Estermont, was never found. The fool, Patchface, did wash ashore, but the trauma of the event robbed him of his wits.

In his youth, Steffon served as a page at King's Landing, and became close friends with Aerys and [[Tywin Lannister]]. As Aerys's relationship with Tywin deteriorated, many believed that the king would name Steffon as [[Hand of the King]] upon his return from the Free Cities; instead, matters only grew worse after Steffon's death, as Aerys became convinced that Tywin had arranged the sinking of the ''Windproud'' to prevent Steffon from taking his place.
