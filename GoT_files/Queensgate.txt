'''Queensgate'''{{Ref|H&L507}} is a castle on the [[Wall]].<ref>"[[The Lord Commanders]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Queensgate is an abandoned castle on the [[Wall]] located between Deep Lake to west and [[Castle Black]] to the east. It was originally named Snowgate, but was renamed when Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen]] visited the castle on her dragon [[Silverwing]]. There was a war between the commanders of Queensgate and the [[Nightfort]] six hundred years before the [[War of the Five Kings]].

[[Stannis Baratheon]] inspects the ruins of Queensgate and Oakenshield during his stay at the Wall. [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jon Snow]] later gives the castle to the [[Free Folk|wildling]] warrior witch Morna White Mask to garrison and settle her people.
