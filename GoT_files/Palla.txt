'''Palla'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the daughter of [[Farlen]], the [[kennelmaster]] of Winterfell.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Palla carries a large pallet of straw through the Great Hall of Winterfell. [[Summer]] passes by, and she becomes uncomfortable by the [[direwolf]]'s proximity.{{Ref|GOT201}}

[[Farlen]] is defiant when Winterfell is [[Capture of Winterfell|occupied]] by [[Theon Greyjoy]] and his men. Palla helps him up when he is beaten for his words.{{Ref|GOT206}} They are both present when Theon assembles the people after the escape of [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]], and unveils two charred corpses.{{Ref|GOT207}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Palla is raped by two of the ironborn (one of whom is [[Drennan]]). Theon has the men whipped to show the people of Winterfell that he means to be just, but they still blame him for the rape, which Theon considers unfair.

Later, after Bran and Rickon escape, Theon threatens Palla's safety if her father does not lead the search to find them.

While Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] and his host are on their way to liberate Winterfell, the northern collaborator "Reek" (actually a disguised [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]]) offers to get reinforcements, demanding Palla as his reward. Theon agrees, providing that he brings at least 200 men.

After the [[Sack of Winterfell]], Palla is brought to the [[Dreadfort]]. Her fate is unknown.
