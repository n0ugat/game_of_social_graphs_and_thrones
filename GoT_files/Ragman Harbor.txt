'''Ragman Harbor'''{{Ref|GOT508}} is a harbor in [[Braavos]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Jaqen H'ghar]] instructs [[Arya Stark|Arya]] to turn right with her oyster cart toward Ragman's Harbor, instead of left, on [[Ragman Lane]].<ref>"[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is a Ragman's Harbor. It's one of two harbors in Braavos, the other one is Purple Harbor, which only serves the locals. Ragman's Harbor is poorer, dirtier, and noisier than the Purple Harbor. It's were foreign ships are berthed. Many people make their living around Ragman's Harbor, including porters, mummers, ropemakers, sailmenders, taverners, brewers, bakers, beggars, and whores.

While Arya works as a peddlar, she often goes to Ragman's Harbor, nine days out of ten.
