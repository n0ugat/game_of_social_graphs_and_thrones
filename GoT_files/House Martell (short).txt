==Narration==
'''Oberyn Martell''': ''"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken." The words of [[House Martell]]. A promise to our enemies and a challenge to our lovers.''

''Thousands of years ago, the warrior queen [[Nymeria]] [[Rhoynar migration|crossed]] into [[Dorne]] from [[Essos]], fleeing the [[dragonlord]]s of [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]]. After she landed, she burned her ships, all ten thousand of them, so no cowards could slink home.''

''What a woman. [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] in spirit before she ever was in flesh.''

''She was lucky to land in Dorne, where powerful women are not locked away in [[Sept|septs]] and the beds of old men. My ancestor, [[Mors Martell]], saw her and desired her, and proved that where armies fail, a tongue may succeed.''

''Wedding his strength to hers, his spear to her sun, they [[Nymeria's War|subdued]] all of his rivals together. After the tradition of her people, House Martell then ruled Dorne as [[Prince of Dorne|Princes]], not kings, unless the eldest child was a daughter.''

''For unlike the rest of [[Westeros]], our loyalty is not commanded by a cock. We follow a Prince or a Princess Martell just the same, and we always have.''

''Some people forget that [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] crowned himself lord of six kingdoms, not [[Seven Kingdoms|seven]]. When [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|his sister]] [[First Dornish War|marched on Dorne]], she found no mighty hosts drawn up against her for [[Meraxes|her dragon]] to burn and her soldiers to slaughter.'' 

''The sands swirled, men died, and her dragon saw nothing. The sun shone, men died, and her dragon bowed to our greater fire. The [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] retreated with their tails tucked between their legs.''

''Of course, in later years, his descendants would try again. [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron the First]] [[Conquest of Dorne|succeeded]] at great cost and reigned in Dorne for a few glorious months.''

''One night, [[Lyonel Tyrell|his steward]] pulled down a sash by his bed to summon his consorts. Instead, the canopy split open, and a hundred red scorpions fell on him. He was a [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]]. You would think he would be used to getting stung.''

''Within a fortnight, House Martell again ruled a free Dorne. Eventually, after centuries of courtship, House Martell got into bed with the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]. We took King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|his sister]] for [[Myriah Martell|our]] [[Maron Martell|own]] before they could take each other, and six kingdoms became seven.''

''Even now, I do not blame my ancestors. One look at those long silver locks. It is not every day a man gets to ride a dragon.''

''But they soon learned that you can't leap off a dragon at will. My sister, [[Elia Martell|Elia]]. She married Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and became the Princess she already was.''

''In Dorne, she walked among vipers, and none would bite her. In [[King's Landing]], she found herself surrounded by [[House Lannister|lions]].''

''When [[Robert Baratheon]] [[Robert's Rebellion|rebelled]] against [[Aerys II Targaryen|his rightful king]], his future father-in-law, [[Tywin Lannister]], [[Sack of King's Landing|ordered]] his beast [[Gregor Clegane]] to rape and murder my sister along with her [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|helpless]] [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|children]].''

''And men call the Lannisters "heroes."''

''Now, Lannisters sit on the [[Iron Throne]], surrounded by the [[Iron Throne|blasted swords]] of Aegon's broken foes. I wonder if they remember, as I do, that none of those swords are ours.''

''I wonder if they see, as I do, my sister's red blood soaking into the stones of their precious [[Red Keep]]. Maybe they need reminding. The lion may be a mighty beast, but pride always lifts his gaze to the horizon, never seeing, in the grass, the viper.''

==Behind the scenes==
*Oberyn says that Nymeria and the Rhoynar came to Dorne "thousands" of years ago, but this is just speaking loosely: they arrived in Dorne about one thousand years ago. It might have been better to say they came "centuries" ago, but it was still long before the Targaryen Conquest (which was 300 years ago).
*Oberyn says that Daeron I ruled Dorne for "a few short months", which is basically accurate, though as Varys correctly states in the short "[[The Death of Kings]]", Daeron I held Dorne for only four years (few enough years that Oberyn chooses to scoff at it by measuring it in months).
