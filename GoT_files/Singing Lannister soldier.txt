{{Quote|Where did you learn the Lannister song?|The soldier to [[Bronn]]|Blackwater}}
A '''singing Lannister soldier''' is a knight in service to [[House Lannister]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
He is drinking with [[Bronn]] prior to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. They sing "[[The Rains of Castamere]]" together and he asks how Bronn knows the Lannister song. Bronn says that he learned it from drunk Lannisters. He remains for the awkward face off between Bronn and [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]. He rushes to the [[River Gate]] when the bells sound the call to arms.{{Ref|GOT209}}

He is part of the sortie led by the Hound to repel the attackers. He survives the fighting and takes the water that the Hound refuses afterwards. When [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] tries to rally the men for another sortie, he protests that the gate is the only way out, and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s men are already at the gate. Tyrion explains that he is going to show them another way out. He is not seen after the fighting begins.{{Ref|GOT209}}
