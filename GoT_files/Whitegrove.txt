'''Whitegrove'''{{Ref|THTDB201}} is a castle in the [[Reach]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Whitegrove was once ruled by [[House Peake]], but they were stripped of the castle for siding with the [[Daemon Blackfyre|Black Dragon]] in the [[Blackfyre Rebellion|First Blackfyre Rebellion]]. Its current rulers are unknown.
