'''Tobho Mott''' is a master armorer and blacksmith in [[King's Landing]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Tobho Mott is a master armorer and blacksmith living in the city of [[King's Landing]]. Despite being a foreigner from the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Qohor]], he is well-regarded for the quality of his work and has received the patronage of many knights and even some lords. Mott is assisted by his apprentice smith, a young man named [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]].{{Ref|GOT104}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Eddard Stark]] learns from [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] that his predecessor [[Jon Arryn]] visited Mott several times prior to his death. Eddard goes to question Mott and learns that Arryn displayed a particular interest in Gendry.{{Ref|GOT104}}

Gendry tells [[Arya Stark|Arya]] that he is an armorer's apprentice, but his master got sick of him, so he ended up at [[Yoren]]'s caravan; apparently, Gendry is unaware that he was made to leave for the [[Wall]] to avoid the upcoming [[massacre in King's Landing|purge of Robert's other bastard children]].{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Mott is forcibly questioned by the [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]] about the whereabouts of Gendry. He reluctantly tells [[Janos Slynt]] that Gendry joined the [[Night's Watch]] and that he can be recognized by the bull-shaped helm he sports.{{Ref|GOT201}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
When Gendry mentions to the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] that he apprenticed under Tobho, [[Thoros]] notes that Tobho charges double what the other smiths do. Gendry retorts this by saying it is because his work is twice the quality.{{Ref|GOT302}} Later, Gendry says he is done serving men, because Tobho sold him to the Night's Watch.{{Ref|GOT305}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tobho Mott is a native of the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Qohor]] who learned to smith there, including the working of the fabled [[Valyrian steel]]. He moved to [[Westeros]] when younger and has successfully built up his own business thanks to his formidable skills. His armory is a large building at the top of the Street of Steel, impressive in size and outfitting.

Tobho used to scold Thoros about the latter's habit of dousing his blades in [[wildfire]], which subsequently wrecked the steel.

It is not Littlefinger but a potboy, who belonged to Arryn's household, who tells Eddard that Arryn and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] visited Mott. Mott tells Ned that they indeed visited his armory, and asked to see Gendry.

When Eddard asks Mott who paid him Gendry's apprentice fee, Mott answers evasively, but eventually admits it was [[Varys|a mysterious lord]] who did not identify himself that paid him both the apprentice fee and to keep his mouth shut about the youth.

In the books, Mott is not interrogated about Gendry's whereabouts. It is not explained how the Gold Cloaks knew that Gendry was with [[Yoren]]'s caravan.

Mott, not [[Valyrian sword smith|an unnamed smith from Volantis]], is the one who melts [[Ice]] to forge two [[Widow's Wail|new]] [[Oathkeeper|swords]] at [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s order.
