'''Rennick''' was a [[man-at-arms]] in the service of [[House Lannister]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Rennick is a soldier on sentry duty at the camp of the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] forces commanded by Ser [[Stafford Lannister]], on their way to reinforce [[Tywin Lannister]]'s army in the [[Riverlands]].{{Ref|GOT204}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
He is on duty with a fellow guardsman at the perimeter of Ser Stafford's camp prior to the [[Battle of Oxcross]]. They debate on who is the greatest swordsman in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]: he argues against [[Gregor Clegane]] who is big rather than skilled, and [[Loras Tyrell]] who is just too pretty, though he does give credit to "our man [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], if he ever gets out".{{Ref|GOT204}}

They both hear that the horses are spooked, but they aren't too concerned. Then he hears something and walks out into the darkness. The other guardsman follows hesitantly. When Rennick starts to draw his sword, the man thinks they are being attacked, but Rennick merely passes gas and starts laughing at him.{{Ref|GOT204}}

[[File:Rennick 2.jpg|thumb|Rennick looks up as a guardsman screams.]]
As Rennick stops to urinate, the guardsman sees that the horses are getting more upset not less, but Rennick is not paying attention until the man screams his name. Rennick looks up just in time to see [[Grey Wind]] leaping out of the darkness at him. He loses part of his face during the attack. In the subsequent attack by the [[House Stark|Stark]] army, the camp is taken completely by surprise, and the Lannister army is annihilated.{{Ref|GOT204}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Rennick.
