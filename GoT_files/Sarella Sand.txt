'''Sarella Sand'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a [[bastard]] daughter of [[Prince]] [[Oberyn Martell]] and is a member of the [[Sand Snakes]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Sarella Sand is the fourth of the eight [[bastard]] daughters of [[Prince]] [[Oberyn Martell]], known as the "[[Sand Snakes]]".{{Ref|GOT405}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Oberyn mentions his eight bastard daughters to [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]].{{Ref|GOT405}}

==Family==

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Sarella is Oberyn's daughter whom he fathered on a ship captain from the [[Summer Isles]]. Her mother is the captain of the ''Feathered Kiss''.

Sarella has her mother's looks of dark brown skin, curly black hair, and black eyes, though like all the Sand Snakes she has her father's widow's peak and the same shape to her eyes.

Sarella is nearly twenty years old, and has a reputation for insatiable curiosity and ''"pushing in where she didn't belong"''. While [[Obara Sand|Obara]] and [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] inherited their father's martial prowess, and [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]] his skill with poisons, Sarella inherited his keen intellect.

Sarella is the only Sand Snake who has not yet appeared or gotten involved in the recent Dornish affairs, either in the novels or the released sample chapters, only briefly mentioned. After [[Doran Martell|Doran]] hears what Obara, Nymeria and Tyene have in mind to avenge their father, he says that he hopes Sarella shows more common sense than her sisters. Currently she is outside of Dorne (it is not revealed where exactly), hence she is the only of the Sand Snakes who is not arrested, nor does she take any part in the missions that Doran assigns her elder sisters and her cousin Arianne to.

In the fourth novel, [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] meets at the [[Citadel]] a novice who introduces himself as Alleras aka the Sphinx, claiming that his father is Dornish and his mother is a Summer Islander trader. There is a fan theory that Alleras is in fact Sarella in disguise, since his name is Sarella spelled backwards, and based on what he tells about himself. If the theory is correct, it is unknown why Sarella is in [[Oldtown]] - whether she intends to become a maester (which is plausible in view of her thirst for knowledge), or is disguised as a part of a plan she has in store for settling the score with the Lannisters.

Sarella hasn't been identified by name in the TV series, though Oberyn did mention that he had eight daughters, just as in the novels, which indicates that she probably also "exists" in the TV continuity, even if she has not yet been featured.
