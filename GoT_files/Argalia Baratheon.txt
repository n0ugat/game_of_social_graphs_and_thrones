'''Argalia Baratheon''' was an early member of [[House Baratheon]].

==Biography==
Argalia was the daughter of [[William Baratheon]] and [[Martyna Mullendore]].<ref name="Lineages>''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' prop ([https://www.factinate.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Catspaw-Season-1.png see image], Argalia's father's entry is in the lower right)</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Argalia Baratheon is mentioned in the section on House Baratheon in the Season 1 prop for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. Her name does not appear on screen.

The character appears to have been named after her ancestor [[Argella Baratheon|Argella Durrandon]], whose name is misspelled as "Argalia" in the prop book. Argella's name has since been corrected in supplementary material, but this character's name has not. Therefore this page keeps the name "Argalia Baratheon."

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no such character.
