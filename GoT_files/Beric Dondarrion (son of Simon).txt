==Biography==
===Background===
Beric is the son and successor of Lord [[Simon Dondarrion]] of [[Blackhaven]]. Beric's [[steward]] is the [[Criston Cole's father|father]] of Ser [[Criston Cole]].{{Guideref|Criston Cole}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Beric is among a large group of suitors who have come to [[Storm's End]] to ask [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s hand in marriage. He speaks at length about his castle, Blackhaven, and mentions Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen]]. When Rhaenyra rudely jokes about his age, [[Boremund Baratheon]] says that her conduct is unseemly. She retorts that it is unseemly for a man older than her father to put himself forward as a marriage candidate.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the Lord Dondarrion whom Criston's father served is unnamed, and his relation to Simon Dondarrion is unspecified. In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Beric Dondarrion]] is the Lord of Blackhaven during the reign of [[Robert Baratheon]], who eventually becomes the leader of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].
