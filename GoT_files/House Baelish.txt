{{Quote|Once, House Baelish had no lands, no name and no gold. Now, we have quite a lot of each. What new rung will the next generation climb? Let us not be hasty. I am not finished yet.|[[Petyr Baelish]]|House Baelish (short)}}
'''House Baelish'''{{Ref|H&L402}} of [[Harrenhal]] is an extinct [[noble house]] that held fealty to [[House Arryn]] of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. They ruled [[Harrenhal]] and an [[Baelish keep|unnamed castle]] in the smallest of the [[Fingers]].

[[Petyr Baelish]], called "Littlefinger", was the only living member of the House at the beginning of the fourth century. Therefore, his personal sigil has come to be used as the House's main [[heraldry]]: a seemingly innocuous black mockingbird on a yellow background.

==History==
House Baelish began with [[Petyr Baelish's great-grandfather|Petyr's great-grandfather]], a common [[Mercenary|sellsword]] from [[Braavos]] who traveled to [[Westeros]] to take up service with [[House Corbray]] in the [[Vale of Arryn]]. The sellsword's [[Petyr Baelish's grandfather|son]], Petyr's grandfather, was a poor wandering [[hedge knight]], who managed to earn a minor [[lordship]] - the most minor of lordships, just a few stony acres in the smallest peninsula of the [[Fingers]], with a small keep to reside in.

[[Lord Baelish|Petyr's father]] fought in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], the preemptive assault on the forces of [[Maelys Blackfyre]], the last of the [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre pretenders]], before they could invade [[Westeros]]. During the conflict Petyr's father served well under [[Lord of Riverrun|Lord]] [[Hoster Tully]]. Through their good relationship, Hoster agreed to [[Ward|foster]] his son Petyr at [[Riverrun]], a great honor for a lesser House.

Seeing Littlefinger's financial acumen, Jon Arryn brought Petyr "Littlefinger" to the royal court at [[King's Landing]], and made him [[Master of Coin]]. In charge of [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|the crown]]'s treasury, Littlefinger rapidly grew into a powerful player of royal politics, and a master of court intrigues.<ref>"[[House Baelish (short)|House Baelish]]"</ref>

Since Littlefinger had no offsprings, his House became extinct at his demise.

===Ancestors===
*{[[Petyr Baelish's great-grandfather]]}, a [[Braavos]]i [[Mercenary|sellsword]] and founder of the House. Littlefinger's great-grandfather.
**{[[Petyr Baelish's grandfather]]}, a [[hedge knight]] and son of the founder. Littlefinger's grandfather.
***{[[Lord Baelish]]}, son of the hedge knight and father of Littlefinger. Entered the ranks of the minor nobility when he was granted some small, very meager lands in the smallest peninsula of the [[Fingers]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Petyr is the only living member of House Baelish, though he is so poor that he gained all of his current wealth due to his own career as a treasurer. Petyr's great skills with numbers and banking led him to become the tax and revenue collector for Gulltown, the principal city of the Vale. At [[Defender of the Vale|Lord]] [[Jon Arryn]]'s suggestion, [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]] later made Petyr his Master of Coin for the whole realm, a role he continues to serve in until he is sent back to the Vale to enter into a profitable [[marriage]]-alliance with Lysa Arryn.

The sigil of House Baelish is – or was – the grey stone head with fiery eyes of the [[Titan of Braavos]], on a light green field. It was chosen by Petyr's grandfather when he was [[Knighthood|knighted]], because his own father was from Braavos. However, the current lord of the House (Littlefinger) prefers to use his personal mockingbird sigil exclusively. Since he is the only living member of the House, the mockingbird sigil has functionally replaced the original. In the books, Littlefinger's personal heraldry actually consists of a field of multiple silver mockingbirds on a green plain.

Petyr rarely returns home, leaving the keeping of his minor towerhouse to a small staff. The original lands of House Baelish are so meager that their towerhouse doesn't even have a formal name, and it is so small that it doesn't have a [[Order of Maesters|maester]] assigned to it.

The only real benefit Petyr received from being born into House Baelish is that it technically made him a member of the minor nobility, thus allowing his initial entry into court life. Petyr downplays his partial descent from the [[Free Cities]] of the [[Essos|east]], even abandoning the use of the original sigil of House Baelish, displaying the Titan of Braavos, to his own personal sigil featuring a mockingbird. Thus, it is somewhat ironic that he criticizes [[Varys]] for being from the Free Cities.
