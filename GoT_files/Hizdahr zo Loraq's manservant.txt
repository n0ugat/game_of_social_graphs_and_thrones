'''Hizdahr zo Loraq's manservant''' is a [[Meereen]]ese man serving the [[House of Loraq]].

==Biography==
===Background===
He is a [[Meereen]]ese man serving the [[House of Loraq]]. His clothing and lack of collar suggest that he is a free man working as a servant, not a [[Slavery|slave]], even prior to Daenerys's victory.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
He's alongside [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] when the [[Great Masters]] gather over the walls of Meereen when [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and her army appear before the city gates to lay [[Siege of Meereen|siege]] to the city.{{Ref|GOT403}}

He later accompanies Hizdahr to petition the Queen on the matter of burying his father's remains. The manservant follows protocol by communicating (in [[Low Valyrian]]) with [[Missandei]] instead of having Hizdahr and Daenerys actually speak, but the queen has them dispense with the pageantry and orders Hizdahr to to address her directly.{{Ref|GOT406}}
