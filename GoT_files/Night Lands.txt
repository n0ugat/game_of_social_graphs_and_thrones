The '''Night Lands'''{{Ref|GOT110}}{{Note|[[Dothraki]]: ''Rhaeshi Ajjalani''<ref>[http://www.dothraki.com/2012/04/rhaeshi-ajjalani/ David J. Peterson's blog], Dothraki.com, April 9, 2012.</ref>}} is the name given to the land of the dead in the [[Dothraki]] [[Great Stallion|belief system]].

For a Dothraki soul to enter the Night Lands to ride with his or her ancestors, the body must be burned in a [[funeral]] pyre.{{Ref|GOT202}} It is a major insult to the dead to leave his or her body unburned.{{Ref|GOT108}}

When [[Daenerys Targaryen]] sees her dead husband [[Drogo]] in the [[House of the Undying]], she asks if she is joining him in the Night Lands.{{Ref|GOT210}}
