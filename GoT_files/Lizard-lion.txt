'''Lizard-lions'''{{Ref|H&L303}} are large carnivorous reptiles that live in the bogs and swamps of the [[Neck]] in [[Westeros]]. [[House Reed]], the ruling house of the [[Crannogmen]], employ as their [[Heraldry|sigil]] a black lizard-lion on a grey-green field.

==Range==
Lizard-lions are only found in the swamps of the Neck, the narrow isthmus that connects the [[North]] to the rest of Westeros.

==Biology==
Lizard-lions are semi-aquatic reptiles, so-named because they grow to the size of [[lion]]s and, like them, are carnivorous.

Lizard-lions have also been known to attack unwary men who wander through the marshes and bogs of the Neck.

==Heraldry==
[[File:Reed Sigil.png|thumb|right|The sigil of House Reed showing a lizard-lion.]]
The Lizard-lion is the sigil of [[House Reed]], a noble house of [[crannogmen]] that rules the Neck as vassals of [[House Stark]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, lizard-lions are the only species of [[Wikipedia:Crocodilia|crocodilian]] known to inhabit the entire continent of Westeros - it is unknown if similar species exist in the other continents. Like their real-life analogues, they are ambush predators that hunt by lying entirely still in the water, resembling floating logs.

Exactly what ''kind'' of crocodilian lizard-lions are supposed to represent is unknown: for some time it was unknown if names such as "crocodile", "alligator", or "caiman" exist in their fictional world. Therefore it was unclear if "Lizard-lion" was simply their in-universe term for "crocodile", or a unique fictional variant of possibly much larger size. Author [[George R.R. Martin]] has stated that not every species of animal in Westeros has a direct one-for-one equivalent to a real-life species of animal. For example, Martin said that [[shadowcat]]s have no direct real-life analogue: they are larger than cougars (mountain lions) but smaller than tigers, and don't look quite like either. Notably, lizard-lions occur in a colder habitat than real world modern crocodilians aside from the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_alligator Chinese alligator].

The ''World of Ice and Fire'' sourcebook (2014) answered this by referring to both "lizard-lions" in the Neck and "crocodiles" in [[Sothoryos]]. Thus "lizard-lion" isn't simply their term for "crocodiles". It's possible that lizard-lions are larger than regular crocodile much as direwolves are larger than common wolves - or like shadowcats, they could just be a fantasy variant of other crocodilians.

Another species of large reptile exists in the jungles of [[Yi Ti]] in eastern [[Essos]], known as "[[basilisk]]s", apparently roughly dog-sized and venomous. Many have been imported to [[Qarth]] or [[Slaver's Bay]] where they are set against dogs in fighting pits for entertainment. They may be only distantly related to lizard-lions.

In the first book, as the Stark-Baratheon caravan passes south over the Neck, corresponding to the episode "[[The Kingsroad]]", [[Arya Stark]] says that she hopes to see a lizard-lion. In the second book, when [[Meera Reed|Meera]] and [[Jojen Reed]] join [[Bran Stark]], Bran is curious about lizard-lions and asks them what they are like, as they don't live in the cold regions north of the swamps.

Legends about the [[Marsh King]]s of the [[crannogmen]] during the [[Age of Heroes]] say that they actually rode lizard-lions as mounts, though these are generally dismissed as mere legends. This may be a distorted memory, however, of [[Warg|skinchangers]] among the crannogmen magically controlling lizard-lions with their minds.
