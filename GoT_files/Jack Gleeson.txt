'''Jack Gleeson''' (born 20 May 1992) is an Irish actor who has worked in television and film. He has a minor role in the film ''[[wikipedia:Batman Begins|Batman Begins]]'' and received a number of outstanding reviews for his lead role in the film ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1507250/ All Good Children]'', with [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117942831?refcatid=31 Variety] describing him as "''the pic's big discovery''."

He starred in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. He was announced in the role on 19 July 2009. He was part of the starring cast from [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] until [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]] when he was killed off. In 2012, he announced his intention to retire from acting to focus on his studies once his work on the show was complete. In 2020, he returned to acting and has since appeared in the BBC sitcom ''Out of Her Mind'' and the films ''Rebecca's Boyfriend'' and ''In the Land of Saints and Sinners''.

Gleeson admitted he was not entirely aware of the hatred of Joffrey before he was given the role. He said he had read some synopses but didn't know that Joffrey was quite the monster he appears to be in the show. Gleeson said his performance was influenced by numerous Hollywood villains, in particular [[Wikipedia:Joaquin Phoenix|Joaquin Phoenix]]'s performance as the crazed, petulant Emperor Commodus in the movie ''[[wikipedia:Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]''.<ref>Hill, Logan (June 2012).

Gleeson was born in Cork, Ireland. He is a student of Trinity College Dublin and a member of DU Players. As a result, Gleeson's natural speaking voice actually has a pronounced Irish upper-class accent. The accent he adopts while playing Joffrey on-screen is a conscious part of his performance. In the Blu-ray commentary for "[[Lord Snow]]", [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark]]) explains that for amusement between takes, the English-accented Turner and Irish-accented Gleeson would imitate one another's accents.

Gleeson said that when he was cast he read ahead on Wikipedia, so he already knew how his character ultimately died, instead of it coming as a shock in Season 4.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/new-blu-ray-video-extra-game-of-thrones-fallen-roundtable/ ]</ref>
