==Narration==
'''Viserys Targaryen''': ''This [[Known world|world]] wasn't always so small and petty. Thousands of years ago, while the rest of men prayed to gods, the [[Valyrians]] became them.''

''Through [[magic]] or sheer will, they mastered the [[Dragon|greatest creatures]] in [[history]]. A horse grants man dominion over the land, a ship over the sea. But [[dragon]]s gave us the sky, and everything and everyone beneath it.''

''At its height, my ancestors ruled the [[known world]]. Whatever parts we didn't weren't worth knowing. Our capital of [[Old Valyria|Valyria]] shamed the magnificent cities of [[Yi Ti|the east]], for hammers and chisels were no match for dragonfire and sorcery. It was a city and an [[Valyrian Freehold|empire]] built to last until the end of time.''

''It didn't.''

''Four hundred years ago, the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]] fell on Valyria.''

''Mountains cracked open like eggs. Lakes and rivers boiled. Fountains of fire, ash, and smoke spewed from the ground, so high and so hot that even dragons burned in flight. The [[Valyrian peninsula|land]] splintered, and the [[Smoking Sea|angry sea]] rushed in. In hours, the greatest city in history became history.''

''But my [[House Targaryen|ancestors]] didn't burn or drown with the rest of their race. Twelve years before the Doom, despite the sneers of his rivals, [[Aenar Targaryen]] abandoned the capital with his family.''

''Legends claim that his [[Daenys Targaryen|daughter]] foresaw the destruction of the city in a dream. More likely, Aenar met with some mishap at court and chose exile over execution.''

''He and [[House Targaryen]] slinked away to a [[Dragonstone (island)|dreary, remote, godforsaken island]]. Forsaken no longer. With arts now lost to the world, we transformed a tiny outpost into [[Dragonstone]], a fortress fit for the last [[dragonlord]]s.''

''Then Aenar's descendants settled into it like a tomb for their lost homeland. Until [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]]. When he looked [[Essos|east]], he saw the past: old, tired, dead. But when he looked [[Westeros|west]], he saw the future: gold in the ground, gold in the fields, and no dragons in the sky but his.''

''He and his sisters, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]], flew over the [[Westeros|great continent]], ostensibly visitors to a strange land. But when Aegon returned, he ordered construction of a [[Painted Table|massive table]] carved in the shape of [[Westeros]], with all the notable rivers and mountains that they had seen. A personal map of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], then ruled by seven squabbling families.''

''[[House Durrandon]] held the [[Stormlands]] from their seat at [[Storm's End]], due south of Dragonstone.''

''[[House Hoare]] of the [[Iron Islands]] had also conquered and enslaved the [[Riverlands]], and ruled them from [[Harrenhal]], a monstrous castle rising on the shore of the [[Gods Eye]].''

''[[House Stark]] held the frozen wasteland of the [[North]], the oldest, largest, and emptiest of the kingdoms.''

''[[House Lannister]] held the [[Westerlands]], the wealthiest kingdom thanks to their gold mines.''

''[[House Gardener]] held the [[Reach]], the second wealthiest kingdom thanks to their crops.''

''[[House Arryn]] held the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], or rather the Vale held them. The mountains were impassable except through the [[Bloody Gate]], which had never been taken.''

''[[House Martell]] held the deserts of [[Dorne]], probably because no one else wanted them.''

''Together, the Seven Kingdoms made Westeros, a realm that wasn't yet a realm, ruled by great families who didn't know what greatness was. Aegon would [[Aegon's Conquest|teach]] them.''

==Behind the scenes==
*The chapter doesn't specify this, but the Targaryens stayed isolated on Dragonstone for about one century after the Doom but before Aegon I invaded mainland Westeros. In the meantime, the Valyrians' former empire across the rest of Essos fell apart in the [[Century of Blood]].
*Seven generations of Targaryens lived on Dragonstone before the War of Conquest: counting Aenar Targaryen as the first, and Aegon I and his sisters as the seventh.
*The Valyrians established an outpost on Dragonstone about two centuries before Aenar Targaryen moved his household there. It was an ideal location for controlling sea trade along the east coast of Westeros, and to trade with the local kings of Westeros - who were willing to pay exorbitantly for [[Valyrian steel]] weapons.
*In the novels, Tyrion ponders why the Valyrians stopped at Dragonstone and didn't continue to conquer the rest of Westeros: the dragonlords were still at the height of their power, and Westeros was divided into seven rival kingdoms (even the later Aegon I, with a small fraction of the Valyrians' forces, was able to successfully conquer them). Season 7 of the TV series strongly implies that the reason they came was for the massive [[dragonglass]] mine beneath the island, which was so valuable it's all they cared about.
*Aenar Targaryen actually brought ''five'' dragons to Dragonstone island: one of them was [[Balerion]], but the other four later died through as-yet undescribed circumstances (possibly just old age, as other sources say they didn't fight each other). These other four left behind eggs, however, from which later hatched [[Meraxes]] and [[Vhagar]], so the Targaryens had three dragons by Aegon I's time.
