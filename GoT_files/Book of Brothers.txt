[[File:Briennewiththebookofbrothers.jpg|thumb|Ser Brienne Tarth completes Jaime Lannister's entry in the ''Book of Brothers''.]]
{{Quote|So this is the famous <u>Book of Brothers</u>... all the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard.|King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]|Two Swords}}
The '''''Book of Brothers''''',{{Ref|GOT401}} sometimes referred to as the '''White Book''',{{Ref|HOTD103}} is the tome that records the deeds of every [[Knighthood|knight]] who has ever served in the three hundred year history of the [[Kingsguard]].

The book is kept in the [[Red Keep]] in the [[White Sword Tower]], where the knights of the Kingsguard have their sleeping cells. The book is in the uppermost floor of the tower in the room where the seven meet. It is the responsibility of the current [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] to update the entries in the book.

Each knight who has been made a member of the Kingsguard since the reign of King [[Aegon I Targaryen]] has a page within the book detailing his deeds. On the top left-hand corner of the page his personal or family arms are drawn while at the bottom right-hand corner are the arms of the Kingsguard.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] passingly reads through some entries in the ''Book of Brothers'', particularly those of Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] and Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]. When he comes to [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]'s rather brief entry, Joffrey sarcastically remarks that someone has forgotten to record all of Jaime's great deeds. Joffrey is surprised that Ser Duncan has four entire pages devoted to his exploits, much more than is usual, and says he must have been quite a man. Jaime agrees that everyone says he was.<ref>"[[Two Swords]]"</ref>

[[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] reads aloud Jaime's entry during their goodbye conversation.<ref>"[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]"</ref>

Jaime is alone again in the White Sword Tower quietly reading over his short entry, when Cersei arrives. Having just told off her father Tywin by threatening to publicly admit that the rumors are true that she has been having an incestuous relationship with Jaime, she is filled with self-confidence and begins to seduce Jaime. They have sex on the chamber's main table.<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Following the [[Battle of King's Landing]] and the deaths of all members of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s Queensguard, Brienne is named Lord Commander of the Kingsguard for King [[Bran Stark|Brandon I Stark]]. Brienne tearfully completes the entry of her deceased former lover Jaime, recording all of his deeds since the beginning of the [[War of the Five Kings]] up to his death "defending his queen."<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==Known entries==
===[[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]]'s entry===
''Called the Dragonknight after his noble heritage. Second son to [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys II Targaryen]] and brother to King [[Aegon IV Targaryen| Aegon IV]] and Queen [[Naerys Targaryen]]. Raised to the Kingsguard in his seventeenth year and after rose to Lord Commander. Wielded the [[Valyrian steel|Valyrian]] blade [[Dark Sister]], previously the sword of [[Visenya Targaryen]], sister and wife to [[Aegon I Targaryen| Aegon I]]. Rescued from a snakepit by his cousin [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor I the Blessed]], whom the vipers refused to bite. Fought [[Cregan Stark]], barely defeating him. Won the tourney of [[Riverrun]] in his 21st year, unseating Ser [[Terrence Toyne]] in the final joust. (...)''

===[[Duncan the Tall]]'s entry===
====First appearance====
''(...) [[Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion|Blackfyre Rebellion]]. Raised to Lord Commander of the Kingsguard by King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V]], his former squire. Led the honor guard that escorted [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]], formerly of House Targaryen and the King's uncle, to the [[Wall]]. Defeated all challengers at the tourney of [[Pennytree]], which Aegon V held in his honor and named a commoner as the [[Queen of love and beauty|Queen of Love and Beauty]]. Rescued the daughter of Lord [[Damon Lannister]] from [[Pyke]], after her ship was taken by Greyjoy raiders. Perished in the mysterious [[fire of Summerhall]] with King Aegon and Prince [[Duncan Targaryen|Duncan]].''<ref>[[:File:Duncan the Tall entry.jpg]]</ref>

====Second appearance====
''Born in [[Flea Bottom]]. Family name unknown. Squire to Ser Arthur{{Sic|Arlan}} of [[Pennytree]] who knighted him in his sixteenth year. Defended a [[Tanselle|Dornish woman]] from Prince [[Aerion Targaryen]] at the tourney at [[Ashford]] and was [[Trial by seven of Duncan the Tall|judged]] in a [[trial by seven]].''

''Bested [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor Breakspear]] with the aid of Aerion Targaryen, who was mentally (…) Took Prince Aegon V Targaryen to squire. But he remained a hedge knight. Served [[Eustace Osgrey]] (…) his defence{{Sic|defense}} against the [[Rohanne Webber|Red Widow]] of [[Coldmoat]]. Defeated Ser [[Lucas Inchfield|Lucas Longinch]] in single combat (…) suffering grievous wounds. Uncovered a (…) of Lords to put [[Daemon Blackfyre (son of Daemon)|Daemon II Blackfyre]] on the (…), and defended Prince Aegon from (…)''

====Notes====
*When the first appearance of the entry refers to Aemon "and the King's uncle" (the King being Aemon's father Maekar) joining the Night's Watch at the Wall, the punctuation makes the meaning confusing: Aemon was Aegon V's brother, not his uncle. Aemon was, however, accompanied to the Wall by [[Brynden Rivers|Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers]], who was King Maekar's uncle (specifically, he was the bastard half-brother of Maekar's father Daeron II). A more explicit punctuation would be "...that escorted Maester Aemon, formerly of House Targaryen''',''' (as well as) the King (Maekar)'s uncle (Brynden) to the Wall". Another point of confusion is that the entry begins by referring to Aegon V as the current king, then without signalling shifts tense to refer to Aegon V's father Maekar as "the King".
*In the second appearance of the entry, "[[Arlan of Pennytree]]" is misspelled as "Arthur of Pennytree". The circumstances surrounding the death of [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor Breakspear]] are wrong, with the book claiming Duncan bested him. In "[[Justice of the Seven Kingdoms]]", it is mentioned that Baelor died fighting for Duncan at his trial by seven.

===[[Gerold Hightower]]'s entry===
''(...) while defending the honor and property of the Dornish princess, [[Elia Martell]]. Handed command to Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] due to sustained injuries the same year. Broke three lances against [[Oswell Whent]] at the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal|tourney]] at [[Harrenhal]] and fought with great distinction in the mêlée. Dispatched by King [[Aerys II Targaryen| Aerys]] to locate the crown Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] in the wake of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s [[Robert's Rebellion|Rebellion]]. Died in the Red Mountains of Dorne alongside his sworn brothers Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Oswell Whent after refusing to bend the knee to the new king Robert Baratheon. All were defeated by a small force led by Lord [[Eddard Stark]] of Winterfell.''

===[[Arthur Dayne]]'s entry===
====First appearance====

Won many tourneys and broke twelve lances against [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], Prince of [[Dragonstone]], at the Tourney of Storm's End. In the [[Year of the False Spring]], at the Great Tourney at Harrenhal, he stood against all but the prince once more.''

''Beloved by the people, he acted as their voice in the reign of Aerys II, gathering their concerns and bringing them before the king. Brought in laws for the royal forces to repay the smallfolk for their goods and turned the tide of support against the criminal scourge of the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]]. Led the Kingsguard to victory (...)''

====Second appearance====
''Thirdborn son of Lord Symon of [[House Gaunt]]. Unseated all challengers at tourney of [[Brightwater Keep]], and crowned Lady [[Alys Reyne]] as Queen of Love and Beauty. Unmasked the Mystery Knight of (…)bridge as Ser [[Harlan Grandison]] of the Kingsguard. Appointed to the Kingsuard by King Aerys II Targaryen in his 20th year.

Defended the honour{{Sic|honor}} of Lady (...) against the advances of Lord [[Steffon Baratheon]], but spared him on account of drunkenness.''

''Beloved by the people, he acted as their voice in the reign of Aerys II, gathering their concerns and bringing them before the king.

He allowed said Knight to call for a second blade after the first one was sheared in two, then brought death upon him by delivering the Knight's greatest wish - the Dawn Blade.''

''Knighted Ser Jaime on the field of battle; in his fifteenth year.''

''Killed at the conclusion of Robert Bara's{{Sic|Robert Baratheon's}} rebellion, alongside his sworn brothers in the [[Red Mountains]] of [[Dorne]], presumably by Lord Eddard Stark of [[Winterfell]]. Second son of Beric Dayne of the House Starfall. Named Sword of the Morning and wielder of the great white blade Daww,{{Sic|Dawn}} forged from a fallen star. Won many battles and broke many [-] twelve lances against Rhaegar Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, at the Tourney of Storm's End.

''Beloved by the people, he acted as their voice in the reign of Aerys II, gathering their concerns and bringing them before the king. Brought in laws for the royal forces to repay the smallfolk for their goods and turned the tide of support against the criminal scourge of the Kingswood Brotherhood.''

====Notes====
*The second appearance of the entry in the episode "[[The Iron Throne]]" is different. It erroneously opens with a paragraph that was apparently meant for Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]]'s entry. The rest of the entry (from "''Beloved by the people''" onwards) is about Arthur Dayne.

===[[Barristan Selmy]]'s entry===
''Firstborn son of Ser [[Lyonel Selmy]] of [[Harvest Hall]]: Named "the Bold" in his 15th tourney, where he was defeated and unmasked by [[Duncan Targaryen|Duncan, Prince of Dragonflies]].

Escaped imprisonment and rode south in an attempt to save the [[King's Landing|capital]] from [[Battle of King's Landing|destruction]].''

''Died protecting his [[Cersei Lannister|queen]].''

====Notes====
*In Season 2's episode "[[The Prince of Winterfell]]" it has been said that Jaime was named to the Kingsguard when he was seventeen, not sixteen; according to Season 4's episodes "[[Two Swords]]" and "[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]", he was sixteen. The aforementioned entry on Arthur Dayne in "[[The Iron Throne]]" makes another contradiction, claiming he was knighted at fifteen, which is also the number according to "[[Robert's Rebellion - Jaime Lannister]]" and the novels (see below).
*The two versions of Jaime's entry, as seen in "Two Swords" and "The Iron Throne", are conspicuously different by several aspects: the color of pages, the length of lines, the separation to paragraphs, the spelling of the word "valor", and the most obvious difference - the sentence "''Thereafter known as the Kingslayer''" is written in different handwritings.
*It makes no sense that the first two paragraphs are written in the same handwriting: the first paragraph (at least till the word "field") was presumably written by Gerold Hightower (who was the Lord Commander at that time), but he could not have possibly written the rest of the paragraph about killing Aerys because he was elsewhere, and definitely not the next paragraph about the pardon, because he was killed before it was granted; it was presumably written by Barristan Selmy, thus it should have been different handwriting (the books make a point that Selmy's handwriting is smaller and more elegant than Hightower's).

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the White Book is described as being two feet tall, a foot and a half wide, and a thousand pages thick. In the TV series it is considerably smaller.

The novels reveal the contents of only two of the entries, of Barristan Selmy and Jaime.

===Barristan Selmy's entry===
''Ser Barristan of [[House Selmy]]. Firstborn son of Ser Lyonel Selmy of Harvest Hall. Served as squire to Ser Manfred Swann. Named "the Bold" in his 10th year, when he donned borrowed armor to appear as a mystery knight in the tourney at [[Blackhaven]], where he was defeated and unmasked by Duncan, Prince of Dragonflies. Knighted in his 16th year by King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V Targaryen]], after performing great feats of prowess as a mystery knight in the winter tourney at King's Landing, defeating Prince Duncan the Small and Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Slew Maelys the Monstrous, last of the Blackfyre Pretenders, in single combat during the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. Defeated Lormelle Long Lance and Cedrik Storm, the Bastard of Bronzegate. Named to the Kingsguard in his 23rd year, by Lord Commander Ser [[Gerold Hightower]]. Defended the passage against all challengers in the tourney of the Silver Bridge. Victor in the mêlée at [[Maidenpool]]. Brought King Aerys II to safety during the [[Defiance of Duskendale]], despite an arrow wound in the chest. Avenged the murder of his Sworn Brother, Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]]. Rescued Lady Jeyne Swann and her septa from the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]], defeating [[Simon Toyne]] and the [[Smiling Knight]], and slaying the former. In the [[Oldtown]] tourney, defeated and unmasked the mystery knight Blackshield, revealing him as the Bastard of Uplands. Sole champion of Lord Steffon's tourney at [[Storm's End]], whereat he unhorsed Lord [[Robert Baratheon]], Prince [[Oberyn Martell]], Lord Leyton Hightower, Lord [[Jon Connington]], Lord [[Jason Mallister]], and Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. Wounded by arrow, spear, and sword at the [[Battle of the Trident]] while fighting beside his Sworn Brothers and Rhaegar Prince of [[Dragonstone]]. Pardoned, and named Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, by King Robert I Baratheon. Served in the honor guard that brought Lady [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] of House Lannister to King's Landing to wed King Robert. Led the attack on Old Wyk during [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s [[Greyjoy Rebellion|Rebellion]]. Champion of the tourney at King's Landing, in his 57th year. Dismissed from service by King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey I Baratheon]] in his 61st year, for reasons of advanced age.''{{Bookref|ASOS|67}}

The earlier part of Selmy's career had been entered by the former Lord Commander, Gerold Hightower, in a big forceful hand. Selmy's own smaller and more elegant writing took over with the account of his wounding on the Trident; he returned to the White Sword Tower after his dismissal by Joffrey to write his final entry in the book.

===Jaime Lannister's entry===
Jaime's entry was written by the former Lord Commanders of the Kingsguard, Gerold Hightower and Barristan Selmy. It is slightly different than in the show:

''Ser Jaime of [[House Lannister]]. Firstborn son of Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] and Lady [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. Served against the Kingswood Brotherhood as squire to Lord Sumner Crakehall. Knighted in his 15th year by Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] of the Kingsguard, for valor in the field. Chosen for the Kingsguard in his 15th year by King Aerys II Targaryen. During the Sack of King's Landing, slew King Aerys II at the foot of the Iron Throne. Thereafter known as the "Kingslayer". Pardoned for his crime by King Robert I Baratheon. Served in the honor guard that brought his sister the Lady [[Cersei Lannister]] to [[King's Landing]] to wed King Robert. Champion in the tourney held at King's Landing on the occasion of their wedding.''{{Bookref|ASOS|67}}

Jaime is disappointed to see how scant his entry is in comparison to Barristan Selmy's; he muses that Barristan could have recorded a few of his other tourney victories, and Gerold might have written a few more words about the deeds he had performed when Arthur Dayne broke the Kingswood Brotherhood. Later, he adds the following lines to his entry:

''[[Battle of Whispering Wood|Defeated]] in the [[Whispering Wood]] by the Young Wolf [[Robb Stark]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Held captive at [[Riverrun]] and ransomed for a promise unfulfilled. Captured again by the Brave Companions, and maimed at the word of [[Locke|Vargo Hoat]] their captain, losing his sword hand to the blade of Zollo the Fat. Returned safely to [[King's Landing]] by [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], the Maid of Tarth.''{{Bookref|ASOS|72}}

After adding the above paragraph, Jaime muses that more than three-quarters of his page still remains to be filled. Ser Gerold Hightower had begun his history, and Ser Barristan Selmy had continued it, but the rest Jaime needs to write for himself. He can write whatever he chooses, henceforth.
