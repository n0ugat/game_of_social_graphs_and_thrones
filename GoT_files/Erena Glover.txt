In ''A Feast of Crows'', Erena and her family are taken by Asha to the [[Ten Towers]] in [[Harlaw]]; one of the [[Iron Islands]]. Along the way, they stop at the [[Stony Shore]] to search for a wet nurse for Erena. Instead, they are forced to make do with a goat. After arriving at the Ten Towers, Asha gives orders for the Glovers to be well treated and housed in a tower instead of a dungeon.

Erena and Gawen are left in the care of Asha's aunt Gwynesse Harlaw while Asha and Sybelle return to Deepwood Motte, since Asha fears Erena is too unhealthy for a second sea voyage.
