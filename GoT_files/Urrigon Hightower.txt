{{Quote|Even without records, we have more than enough reason to believe that the Citadel began as a court of scholars and priests. Assembled by a second son of House Hightower. When he died, his elder brother raised the Citadel so that wise men would always have a home in Westeros and could continue the enquiries and debates that had given such joy to his younger brother.|[[Pycelle]]|Oldtown (short)}}
King '''Urrigon Hightower'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was a [[King of the High Tower]] and the founder of the [[Citadel]].

==Biography==
When Urrigon's brother [[Peremore Hightower|Peremore]] died, Urrigon supposedly granted the area that would become the [[Citadel]] to serve as a home to the scholars and priests that Peremore had surrounded himself with. It is believed that the learned men were precursors of the [[Order of Maesters]].{{Ref|H&L612}}{{Ref|H&L702}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Urrigon was the son of Uthor of the High Tower and Maris the Maid, a daughter of [[Garth the Gardener#In the books|Garth Greenhand]].
