The '''basilisk'''{{Ref|GOT406}} is a species of carnivorous reptile, native to the jungles in the southern regions of far eastern [[Essos]]. Basilisks are venomous, and basilisk venom is a notable [[poison]] used in assassinations. Even [[basilisk blood]] is poisonous.{{Ref|H&L404}} The species probably give the name to the [[Basilisk Isles]], where they can be found in.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, basilisks are large, roughly dog-sized venomous reptiles that live in the jungles of [[Yi Ti]], far to the southeast of the [[Dothraki Sea]], across the Bone Mountains. They may also infest the tropical Basilisk Isles off the northern coast of [[Sothoryos]], and also on tropical islands of the [[Jade Sea]] (which Yi Ti is on the northwest coast of), the same islands where poisonous [[Manticore]] insects are also found.

While wild basilisks originated in Yi Ti (and possibly other regions around the Jade Sea), they became a very popular animal for use in [[Fighting pit]]s throughout Essos, made to fight other animals as entertainment. Thus they have been imported into many animal menageries across Essos. When [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] passes through [[Qarth]] she sees a basilisk tearing apart a dog in a fighting pit; they are probably also found in the popular fighting pits in [[Slaver's Bay]].

Exactly what a basilisk looks like is unclear, or if it is even meant to be analogous to a specific kind of real-life reptile. Because basilisks have been seen set against dogs in fighting pits they would seem to be roughly dog-sized, and therefore smaller than the massive [[lizard-lion]]s founds in the swamps of the [[Neck]] in [[Westeros]]. Due to their relative size and possession of venom, they may be somewhat like [[Wikipedia:Komodo dragon|Komodo dragons]] (which in real life are larger than all but the most enormous dogs). For all we know, however, they could be much more like snakes (as the mythological basilisk was often depicted).

The novels have at different points said that both "basilisk venom" and "basilisk blood" are poisonous: they might simply both be toxic.
