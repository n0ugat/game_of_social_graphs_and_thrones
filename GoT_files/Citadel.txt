The '''Citadel''' is the headquarters of the [[Order of Maesters]], scholars who advise the lords of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] on matters scientific, medical, and historical.

The Citadel was granted to the Maesters in the [[Age of Heroes]] by King [[Urrigon Hightower]], whose recently-deceased brother [[Peremore Hightower|Peremore]] was a patron to the learned men. It is administered by the [[Conclave]], the ruling council of [[archmaester]]s. The Citadel is also where young men from the entire continent are trained to become Maesters.

One of the titles held by the head of [[House Hightower]] is "[[Defender of the Citadel]]."{{Ref|HOTD101}}

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
At [[Castle Black]], Maester [[Aemon]] notes to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that the current summer has lasted nine years, and that reports from the Citadel say the days are growing shorter, indicating that its end is soon at hand.<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref> When Aemon later reveals his past to [[Jon Snow|Jon]], the surprised Jon says "You're Aemon Targaryen!". However, Aemon corrects him by stating that he is "a Maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the [[Night's Watch]]", stressing to Jon that a sworn brother of the Night's Watch abandons all previous family ties.<ref>"[[Baelor]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
A special white messenger-[[raven]] arrives at the [[Red Keep]] in [[King's Landing]] from the Citadel. [[Pycelle]] presents it before [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and the [[Small Council]], explaining that it signifies that the conclave of the Citadel has met, considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms and officially declared the ten year long summer to have finally ended, and autumn has arrived in Westeros.<ref>"[[The North Remembers]]"</ref>

After the [[capture of Winterfell]], [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] convinces Maester [[Luwin]] to obey him by pointing out he is a Maester of the Citadel sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell, a title that now belongs to him, as he has forced [[Bran Stark|Bran]] to claim publicly.<ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
When [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is being treated by [[Qyburn]] at [[Harrenhal]] after losing his hand, he notes that Qyburn is not a maester, as he isn't wearing a maester's chain of office. Qyburn explains that the Citadel stripped him of his chain, expelling him from the Order of Maesters, because they found some of his experiments "too bold".<ref>"[[Kissed by Fire]]"</ref> Later, [[Roose Bolton]] points out to Jaime that by treating him and accompanying him back to King's Landing Qyburn hopes [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] will reward him by forcing the Citadel to give him back his chain. During their journey to the capital, Jaime asks Qyburn why exactly the Citadel took his chains, and Qyburn explains he experimented on living men, as ''"the only way to treat disease is to understand disease, and the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted."''<ref>"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
When Cersei recommends the services of Qyburn to a young Lady, Pycelle is infuriated, as he believes Qyburn brought shame on the Citadel with his experiments.<ref>"[[The Lion and the Rose]]"</ref>

After the [[Purple Wedding|poisoning]] of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], Tywin questions [[Oberyn Martell]] about the assassination, as it is well known that he hates the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and he studied poisons at the Citadel.<ref>"[[Breaker of Chains]]"</ref>

In the [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] championed by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and Oberyn Martell, the former for the Crown and the latter for the [[Purple Wedding|accused]] Tyrion, Oberyn dies but he first poisons Clegane grievously with his spear, which was coated with [[manticore]] [[Poison#Known poisons|venom]]. Cersei calls for Pycelle and Qyburn and, though Pycelle insists there is nothing to be done for him, Qyburn claims he can save Clegane. Pycelle protests, as Qyburn is not even a Maester, to which Qyburn replies that is for the best, as no maester knows how to save him. Pycelle exclaims that is the kind of arrogance that had him expelled from the Citadel, which considered Qyburn's experiments dangerous and unnatural, an opinion with which he agrees.<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Cersei appoints Qyburn the new [[Master of Whisperers]] in the name of King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], a decision Pycelle finds bewildering, as he is considered an embarassment to the Citadel.<ref>"[[The House of Black and White]]"</ref>

[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] explains to [[Gilly]] that the Citadel, which harbors the largest library in the world, is located in Oldtown and it's where the maesters are trained. He then tells her about his wish to go to the Citadel and train to become a Maester before he was sent to the Night’s Watch.<ref>"[[Kill the Boy]]"</ref>

Maester Aemon dies of old age and Sam eulogizes him as a ''"maester of the Citadel, chained and sworn, and sworn brother of the Night's Watch, ever faithful."''<ref>"[[The Gift]]"</ref>

After Jon returns from [[Hardhome]], Sam tells him that he wants to go to Oldtown to train at the Citadel to be a maester, so he can return and take the deceased Aemon's place as maester of Castle Black. Jon agrees.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:Sam_in_tower_library.png|thumb|Sam enters the citadel's library in awe. ]]
Sam and Gilly arrive at the Citadel. They enter a spacious chamber and Sam speaks to a [[Citadel maester|maester]] seated at a large counter, writing. The maester listens to Sam's introduction and reads a letter written by Jon while he was [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] of the Night's Watch and checks his records, which still list [[Jeor Mormont]] as Lord Commander and Aemon as maester. He tells Sam that he'll have to speak with an [[Archmaester]] and can wait in the library. He bars Gilly from joining Sam by sharply stating that no women or children are permitted. He then leads Sam into the extraordinary library, which stretches above and below for a number of floors, leaving an amazed Sam to gaze at all the levels and books.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Sam begins to fall into a pattern of servitude at the Citadel, under the tutorial of [[Archmaester]] [[Ebrose]], but keeps more vigorously occupied with the healing of [[greyscale]] of [[Jorah Mormont]] and the discovery of [[dragonglass]] on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone island]].<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref><ref>"[[Stormborn]]"</ref><ref>"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref>

Reading through several of the books Sam retrieves, Gilly is intrigued by various obscure bits of knowledge. She remarks on one page which records that the Citadel has 15,782 steps in it.<ref>"[[Eastwatch]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Samwell, feeling guilty, tells [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and Jorah Mormont that he "borrowed" some books from the Citadel and asks forgiveness for his crimes.<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Citadel is described as a university-like complex of buildings extending along both banks of the River Honeywine in Oldtown, linked by graceful bridges. The Isle of Ravens is the oldest part of the Citadel and the site of the ravenry, from where the maesters send messenger [[raven]]s out to all parts of the Seven Kingdoms. Other locations of note in the Citadel include the Seneschal's Court, Weeping Dock, and Scribe's Hearth.
