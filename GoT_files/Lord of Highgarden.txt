The '''Lord of Highgarden'''{{Ref|GOT302}} is the ruler of the stronghold of [[Highgarden]], the capital of the [[Reach]]. The Lord of Highgarden usually holds the additional titles [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]] and [[Warden of the South]].

The Reach was originally a sovereign nation known as the [[Reach|Kingdom of the Reach]] until [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] arrived in [[Westeros]] and united the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. [[House Tyrell]] were the stewards of Highgarden, swearing fealty to [[House Gardener]] before the latter house was eradicated in the [[Field of Fire]]. After that, Aegon named [[Harlen Tyrell]] as the first Lord Paramount of the Reach.

[[Olenna Tyrell]] was the penultimate ruling Lady of Highgarden of House Tyrell, assuming the title after her son [[Mace Tyrell]] died in the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]] during [[Loras Tyrell]]'s trial. She was later assassinated via [[poison]] by [[Jaime Lannister]] on the orders of [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]].

After the extinction of House Tyrell, Ser [[Bronn]] of the Blackwater, who had been dispatched by [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] to assassinate her brothers [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]], agreed to spare them should he be named the Lord of Higharden after [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] overthrows Cersei.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref> This wish was granted after the [[Battle of King's Landing]] by the newly crowned [[Bran Stark|Brandon Stark]], who additionally named Lord Bronn the [[Master of Coin]] on his [[Small Council]].<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>
