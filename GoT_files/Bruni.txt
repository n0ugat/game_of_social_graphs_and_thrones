==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[File:Osha talking about bruni.png|thumb|220x220px|Osha tells Hodor, Meera, Jojen, Rickon, and [[Bran Stark|Bran]] about the death of her husband, Bruni.]]
Osha tells the story of Bruni to [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and the [[Jojen Reed|Reed]] [[Meera Reed|siblings]] after they consider going [[beyond the Wall]] to prepare for the [[Great War]]: he was a good man who loved her. One day he disappeared, and everyone said he'd simply left her, but she knew him better than that. One night he did return as a [[wight]], and tried to kill her; Osha stabbed him in the heart, but it didn't stop him. Osha ultimately managed to get away by burning down their hut with Bruni inside it.{{Ref|GOT307}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Bruni. On one occasion, Osha mentions that she has a brother, but does not mention any spouse or lover.
