'''Syrax'''{{Guideref|Syrax}}{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Syraks''}} is a goddess of the [[Old Gods of Valyria|Valyrian religion]]. She was worshiped in the the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s [[dragon]] [[Syrax]] is named after her.{{Guideref|Syrax}}

Syrax is represented by the [[Nekesse Valyrio|Valyrian glyph]] for ''sȳz'', meaning "good."<ref name="Glyphs" />

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Syrax and all other Valyrian deities are described as "gods" with no mention of goddesses. This may be because the [[High Valyrian]] language does not have gendered words, and so the word describing her can only be accurately translated as either "god" or "deity."
