'''House Lannister'''{{Ref|GOT105}} of [[Casterly Rock]] is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]], one of its richest and most powerful families and one of its oldest dynasties. They rule over the [[Westerlands]].

==History==
===Background===
House Lannister is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is [[Casterly Rock]], a castle on a rocky promontory overlooking the [[Sunset Sea]]. It overlooks the thriving city of [[Lannisport]] and sits atop the most productive gold mine in the Westerlands. They are the wealthiest family in the realm. 

Fair-haired, tall and handsome, the modern Lannisters are the blood of [[Andals|Andal]] adventurers who carved out a mighty kingdom in the western hills and valleys. Through the female line, they boast of descent from [[Lann the Clever]], the legendary trickster of the [[Age of Heroes]] who swindled Casterly Rock from [[House Casterly]]. They once possessed a Valyrian steel sword called [[Brightroar]], which was lost by King [[Tommen II Lannister]]. With the great riches of Casterly Rock, the Lannisters became [[King of the Rock|Kings of the Rock]] for thousands of years and had opposed the [[Ironborn]] raiders, with King [[Gerold Lannister]] raided the [[Iron Islands]] and took a hundred hostages. During the [[coming of the Andals]], House Lannister initially opposed Andal incursions but later took Andal sons and daughters as [[Ward|wards]] and fosterlings. 

During [[Aegon's Conquest]], as Aegon began defeating the [[Seven Kingdoms]] into compliance, King [[Loren I Lannister|Loren Lannister]] allied with [[King of the Reach|King]] [[Mern IX Gardener]] of the [[Reach]] to defeat [[Aegon I Targaryen]], forming an army of fifty five thousand men and charged the Targaryen host of ten thousand men. As the Targaryen host began splintering, Aegon, [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] unleashed their three dragons for the first and only time, killing over four thousand men, including House Gardener in the decisive [[Field of Fire]]. King Loren was captured and he bent the knee becoming the first Warden of the West. Queen Visenya is said to have been grateful that Loren rode to war instead of seeking refuge in his castle, as Casterly Rock may have withstood even dragonflame.
