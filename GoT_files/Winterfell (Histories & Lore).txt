==Narration==
'''Roose Bolton''': ''[[Brandon the Builder]], founder of [[House Stark]], raised [[Winterfell]] with [[giants]] over eight thousand years ago. Or so nursemaids tell all the children of the [[North]].''

''The children nod, wide-eyed, unaware of the lesson forced on them. That if even giants obeyed a Stark, so too should they.''

''But like every other castle, Winterfell was built in pieces over thousands of years.''

''The [[First Men]] settled there because of the hot springs that bubbled through the ground. The water and the heat helped them survive the Northern winters, and they built defenses to keep it for themselves.''

''Nobody raised the castle all at once, probably nobody meant to raise a castle at all.''

''In those days, the Starks were not the greatest house in the North, and Winterfell was not the greatest castle. [[Barrowton]] was the oldest, dating to the [[First King]], and the Starks [[Thousand Years War|fought]] the [[Barrow King]]s for a thousand years.''

''[[Greywater Watch]] was, like the [[crannogmen]] themselves, the strangest. Only [[marriage]] subdued its [[Marsh King]]s.''

''But the greatest rival to Winterfell was always the [[Dreadfort]], and my ancestors, the [[Red King]]s of [[House Bolton]]. If tales can be believed, we fought from the [[Long Night]] until the [[Andals]] came.''

''Because of us, Winterfell raised its first walls, but we took and burned that castle anyway. Winterfell built more keeps, more walls, more guard towers. They expanded the granaries and larders to survive our sieges.''

''They tended the [[godswood]] to win favor with the [[Old Gods]] against us. As the castle grew, more farmers and villagers flocked every winter from across the North to huddle under its walls, raising the [[winter town]].''

''In the spring these villagers would find themselves marching in the Stark armies to fight against us. The greatness of Winterfell is as much our doing as the Starks.''

''But in the end, neither its stone walls nor its tall keeps and iron gates could save Winterfell. At its height, it could have lasted a year under heavy siege.''

''But a handful of [[Ironborn]] [[Capture of Winterfell|seized it in the night]], while [[Robb Stark|its lord]], the [[King in the North]], was [[War of the Five Kings|playing in the south]]. My dagger [[Red Wedding|ended his reign]] and now House Bolton holds the castle of our ancient enemies. The [[direwolf]] no longer flies from the battlements above me nor guards the doors and cornices of Winterfell against me.''

''Below me, miles of long-dead Starks fade into darkness and obscurity until even their faces are lost. Some Northerners whisper that they wait for the day their house will rise again. They will wait forever.''
