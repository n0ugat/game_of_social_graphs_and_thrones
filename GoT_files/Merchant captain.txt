{{Dialogue a-b|Jaime Lannister|Is that Estermont?|Merchant captain|Tarth, Ser Jaime. The Sapphire Isle.|The captain to [[Jaime Lannister]]|Sons of the Harpy (episode)}}
A '''merchant captain''' is from [[Pentos]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
While sailing to [[Oldtown]], the captain is bribed by [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to smuggle him and [[Bronn]] into [[Dorne]] and keep it a secret.{{Ref|GOT504}}

After dropping off Jaime and Bronn on a Dornish beach, the captain tries to sell this information to [[Obara Sand]] in [[Planky Town]]. Unfortunately for him, she is insulted that he does not offer up such a vital warning for free, and tortures him. The [[Sand Snakes]] bury him up to his neck in the sand, gagged, and covered by a bucket filled with scorpions. Later, Obara kills the captain by impaling him with a spear.{{Ref|GOT504}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no parallel character. Jaime and Bronn never travel to Dorne; instead, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] sends there Ser [[Balon Swann]] on an official mission to take Myrcella back, so he does not need to smuggle himself into the country.
