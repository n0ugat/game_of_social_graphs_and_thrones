'''New Ghis'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a city in the [[Gulf of Grief]], in [[Essos]]. It is located on a small island south of [[Ghiscar]] and separated from the continent by the [[Ghiscari Strait]], putting it to the south of [[Astapor]] and the rest of [[Slaver's Bay]]. It is named after the [[Old Ghis|ruined capital]] of the fallen [[Ghiscari Empire]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, New Ghis is located near the larger island of Ghaen. Much like [[Volantis]] once tried to do with the [[Valyrian Freehold]], New Ghis seeks to rebuild the Ghiscari Empire under its leadership.

New Ghis has a powerful army and fleet, and uses elephants in battle. Its legions draw inspiration from the [[Unsullied]] warrior-eunuchs, but while the Unsullied are slaves the troops of New Ghis are free men who serve for three-year terms.

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', New Ghis joins the coalition of [[Yunkai]] and other cities against [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], sending six legions, a total of 36,000 soldiers.
