'''Anguy''' is a skilled archer hailing from the [[Stormlands]] and a member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Anguy is among the company of [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]] when they come across [[Arya Stark]], [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] and [[Hot Pie]]. He coerces an unwilling Hot Pie into following them to a nearby [[Inn at the Crossroads|inn]] by making an impressive trick-shot. Later on, he presents a captured [[Sandor Clegane]] to his companions and is met with a roar of approval, and is present when Sandor reveals Arya's identity.{{Ref|GOT302}}
[[File:Arya the climb.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Anguy teaches Arya archery.]]
After bringing his captive before [[Beric Dondarrion]], he voices his disgust over the atrocities committed by the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] forces at the [[Mummer's Ford]].{{Ref|GOT304}} Later he is present during the trial by combat which the Hound kills Lord Beric and is freed from his accusations.{{Ref|GOT305}}

Anguy teaches Arya how to shoot a bow properly, when confronted by [[Melisandre]], who has come to claim [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] for the [[Lord of Light]]. He does nothing to stop her, earning himself the wrath of Arya.{{Ref|GOT306}}

When Arya runs away from the Brotherhood, Anguy is sent to bring her back. He is unsuccessful when she is captured by the Hound instead and taken away.{{Ref|GOT307}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Anguy is a superb archer from the [[Dornish Marches]], the mountainous southern region of the [[stormlands]] which borders [[Dorne]]. He won the archery competition during the [[Tournament|Hand's tourney]] and was approached by Alyn, a guardsman on orders from [[Eddard Stark]] to offer him a place on the Stark household guard, but Anguy drunkenly declined. Anguy is part of the [[Iron Throne]] host assembled by [[Eddard Stark]] to execute Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and becomes one of the founders of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|brotherhood without banners]] after the [[battle at the Mummer's Ford]].

Many characters who later formed the brotherhood were introduced at the Hand's tourney in the first novel. This tourney did occur in [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] of the TV series, but the characters were not introduced, because they would not make a significant appearance until Season 3 - they are briefly mentioned in the first novel but only reappear as "the brotherhood" in the third novel (though as in Season 2 of the TV series, in the second novel characters do mention that something called "the brotherhood" is harassing Lannister supply lines).

After the [[Red Wedding]], the brotherhood finds [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]'s body. Despite Thoros's objection, Beric passes her his flame of life; he dies, and Catelyn is reanimated as the monstrous Lady Stoneheart. Under the leadership of Lady Stoneheart, the brotherhood falls low, and currently it is no longer different than any outlaw band; as a result, Anguy and many others abandon the brotherhood.
