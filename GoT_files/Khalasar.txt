A '''''khalasar'''''{{Ref|GOT103}} is a [[Dothraki]] clan or tribe. ''Khalasari'' can be quite small but can expand to encompass tens of thousands of mounted warriors and many more than that number in women and children. ''Khalasari'' are spread across the [[Dothraki Sea]] and frequently raid surrounding regions. ''Khalasari'' which meet on the plains usually engage in battle, except at [[Vaes Dothrak]] where no weaponry is permitted due to the illegality of bloodshed within the city. However, that does not mean that violence in the city is unheard of, with Dothraki devising cunning means to kill without the use of steel or shedding of blood.

''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]]'s ''khalasar'' numbered about 40,000 riders, but was considered unusually large compared to others. ''Khalasari'' sometimes differentiate themselves by decorating their bodies and their horses with different colors of paint. For example, ''Khal'' [[Drogo]]'s ''khalasar'' used blue paint, while Khal [[Jhaqo]]'s ''khalasar'' uses red paint. Such dyes are expensive so they tend to only use them for special occasions.<ref>[http://www.dothraki.com/2012/04/rhaeshi-ajjalani/ David J. Peterson's blog], Dothraki.com</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, a ''khalasar'' is a tribe of horse riders led by a [[Khal]] (warlord). They contain thousands of mounted Dothraki warriors, the largest containing tens of thousands.

''Khalasars'' are subdivided into ''khas'', each of which is commanded by a captain known as a ''ko'' (plural, ''kos'').

Leadership of a ''khalasar'' is not strictly hereditary. Often when a ''khal'' dies his ''khalasar'' will break up into new smaller ones led by his surviving ''kos''. The Dothraki follow strength, so if the son of the current ''khal'' is weak or underaged, they have no reason to follow him (i.e. Daenerys carrying Drogo's unborn son was no reason for his ''khalasar'' to continue to follow her). This way the Dothraki never have a weak child leader inherit rule, which might imperil their survival (such as when the eight year old [[Tommen Baratheon]] inherited the [[Iron Throne]] in Westeros). Other times, however, the son and heir of an older and successful ''khal'' may have himself grown to young adulthood and become a strong and revered warrior in his own right - in which case leadership of the entire ''khalasar'' will indeed pass to the son of the ''khal'', instead of breaking up upon his death. In such cases, the adult son and heir of the current ''khal'' is known as a ''khalakka'': [[Drogo]] was ''khalakka'' to his father [[Bharbo]] and directly succeeded him upon his death, given that by that time Drogo was already a skilled and respected warrior.

Dothraki ''khalasars'' have no names, nor do any have particularly long-lasting or deep histories and affiliations. ''Khalasars'' frequently dissolve on the death of their khal into new, smaller ''khalasars''. On the other extreme, when one ''khalasar'' conquers another ''khalasar'', if often absorbs the remaining forces of the defeated ''khalasar'' instead of simply massacring them. In this fashion, one ''khalasar'' numbering only a few thousand riders can rapidly aggregate more and more lesser ''khalasars'' into itself until it is a single large ''khalasar'' numbering in the tens of thousands. The actual number of riders in any one ''khalasar'' is therefore fluid, as they are frequently dissolving, coalescing into different groups, dissolving again, then re-combining with entirely different groups, etc.

Generally, the ''khalasars'' considered a large number to be in the low tens of thousands (the adult male mounted warriors - the women, children, elderly, and slaves moving with the entire ''khalasar'' will number more than that). Several ''khalasars'' of this size seem to be active at any given time. Khal Drogo's ''khalasar'' contained about 40,000 mounted riders, which was considered unusually large. Back during the great wave of Dothraki expansion in the [[Century of Blood]] following the fall of Valyria, a few ''khalasars'' reached even larger sizes. Khal [[Temmo]]'s horde at the [[Battle of Qohor]] was said to number 50,000. The largest battle of the Dothraki in the Century of Blood was the "Field of Crows," the climactic battle in their campaign against Sarnor, the coalition of city-states at the western end of the Dothraki Sea. Hoping to finally stop the advance of the Dothraki, the Sarnori fielded an allied army of 26,000 horse and 100,000 infantry. To face this force, four separate Dothraki khals allied their four ''khalasars'' into a massive force of 80,000 mounted warriors - apparently an unprecedented number, and they succeeded in crushing the Sarnori. The Dothraki politically fragmented after the first few generations of the Century of Blood, however, so that in subsequent centuries Drogo's ''khalasar'' of 40,000 was considered atypically large.

After [[Drogo]] was rendered catatonic (and soon died), his ''khalasar'' broke up into several smaller ''khalasars'' led by his former ''kos''. [[Pono]] was the first to leave, with 10,000 riders, and he was followed by [[Jhaqo]] who left with 20,000 riders (fully half of Drogo's original ''khalasar''). Jorah explains that over the next few days several smaller bands from the remaining 10,000 riders split off and left as well: Jorah doesn't give the names of their leaders or exactly how many follow each of them, but he does say that (together with Pono and Jhaqo) about a "dozen" new ''khalasars'' formed out of the breakup of Drogo's old one. Given that the remaining 10,000 riders divided up into ten or so smaller groups, however - admittedly of greater and lesser sizes - these smaller bands probably didn't number more than around one or two thousand each.

On the other hand, in the years since Drogo's death, another round of warring between different ''khalasars'' across the Dothraki Sea has led to some being destroyed and others agglomerating into much larger sizes by absorbing defeated ones. By the fifth novel, Khal Jhaqo's force was again in the east near Lhazar and Meereen, and his ''khalasar'' encounters Daenerys when she flies back there on her dragon. Khal Pono, meanwhile, is said to now have a ''khalasar'' of 30,000 mounted warriors - meaning he apparently absorbed several defeated ''khalasars''. Pono's force, however, is now said to be at the western end of the Dothraki Sea, near the headwaters of the Selhoryu River (a tributary of the [[Rhoyne]]) - south of [[Qohor]] and northeast of [[Volantis]]. It is feared that Pono's ''khalasar'' will soon menace Volantis, though many anticipate that he will simply leave again after being given customary tribute.

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Khalasar" is pronounced "KHAL-uh-ssar".
