The '''dusk rose'''{{Ref|GOT401}} is a type of vegetation that exists in the region of [[Slaver's Bay]] on the continent of [[Essos]].

Dusk rose tea eases fever and is a commonly known local remedy around [[Meereen]] - particularly for the [[Slavery|slaves]] who have to make the tea.{{Ref|GOT401}}

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Daario Naharis]] gives [[Daenerys Targaryen]] a dusk rose in a handful of flowers he has picked for her, ostensibly to show her the lay of the land around Meereen, but truly a thinly veiled attempt to woo her.{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daario does present Daenerys with some local flowers as they approach Meereen, but this occurs "off screen" between Daenerys's POV chapters: she recalls it as happening recently in her next chapter. One of these was a "dusky rose".

On-screen, the only rose-shaped plant in Daario's bouquet is a vivid blue, closer to the color one might expect from a [[winter rose]].
