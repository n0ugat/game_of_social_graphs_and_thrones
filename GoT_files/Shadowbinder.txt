A '''shadowbinder'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a practitioner of [[magic]] capable of manipulating [[shadow|shadows]] to do their will. They seemingly hail from [[Asshai]], one of the easternmost cities of the [[known world]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, shadowbinders are mentioned in passing, usually when characters refer to Quaithe or Melisandre. Mentions of Asshai usually follow, suggesting that this form of magic is closely associated with that infamous city. ''The World of Ice & Fire'' elaborates that of the many magic-users who find sanctuary in Asshai, the shadowbinders are the most respected and feared. Shadowbinding is native to Asshai, said to be "by the Shadow," and shadowbinders are the only ones who dare to eat the flesh of the strange fish found in the river Ash, or to leave the city and explore the [[Shadow Lands]] between Asshai and the Mountains of the Morn. Even shadowbinders, however, fear to enter the gates of Stygai, the dread corpse city at the heart of the Shadow Lands.
