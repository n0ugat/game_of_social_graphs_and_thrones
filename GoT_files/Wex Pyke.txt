'''Wex Pyke''' was an [[Ironborn]] raider and a member of the ''[[Sea Bitch]]'' crew.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Wex is present when [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] gives a speech encouraging his crew to resist the [[Northmen]] led by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] and to die a glorious death.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] learn that the Ironborn captured at Winterfell were all [[Flaying|flayed]] alive on Ramsay's orders, despite being promised mercy if they surrendered.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the only character named Wex is Wex Pyke, the bastard son of Lord Sargon Botley of [[Lordsport]]. He is twelve years old and born mute.

Wex has a tangle of dark brown hair, an almost feral face, a wide mouth, a sharp nose and a pointed chin. Like most of the ironborn, he is illiterate, but he is very perceptive.

Wex becomes Theon's squire as part of Theon's deal with Lord Botley to buy a horse from him. He goes with Theon on the raid of the [[Stony Shore]], the [[capture of Winterfell]], and the hunt for [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]]. He is the first to realize that they were tricked, pointing that there are only prints of wolf paws in the ground, but no prints of [[Hodor]].

As Theon's position becomes hopeless, he tells the ironborn they can leave and join [[Yara Greyjoy|his sister]]'s troops at [[Deepwood Motte]] or stay and fight with him against the Northmen who will arrive soon to retake Winterfell. Wex is the first to stand with him, shaming sixteen other ironborn (among them [[Black Lorren]] and [[Harrag#In the books|Harrag]]) into agreeing to stay as well. 

During the [[sack of Winterfell]], Wex climbs a heart tree in the godswood, thus he is neither killed nor captured by Ramsay's men. He witnesses the atrocities that Ramsay commits. After a while, he falls asleep, too scared to climb down. He is awakened by the voices of the Stark boys and their companions. He follows Rickon, [[Osha]] and [[Shaggydog]], staying downwind to avoid detection.

Wex arrives at the [[White Harbor]] (it is not mentioned whether he went there on his own or was captured). By drawing images and answering yes/no questions, he informs Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] what he has seen. He is taught to read and write, and progresses well. That way, Lord Manderly learns to know who really destroyed Winterfell, and more importantly - that Bran and Rickon are alive. Since he is loyal to the Starks, Lord Manderly sees a chance to restore their house.

Some time later, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] arrives at the White Harbor in order to obtain Lord Manderly's support. Lord Manderly treats him with open hostility and has him imprisoned - in order to make the Freys and Lannisters believe that he is loyal to the Iron Throne.

Davos is imprisoned for days, till [[Robett Glover]] takes him to a secret meeting with Lord Manderly. They introduce Wex to Davos, and tell him everything they learned from the youth. Lord Manderly tells Davos he is willing to join [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], on condition that Davos rescues Rickon. Wex shows Davos on a map where Osha and Rickon headed - the island of [[Skagos]].
