{{Quote|I am no one, but she is the Mother of Dragons. She needs true protectors, now more than ever. They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again.

'''Quaithe''', sometimes called '''Quaithe of the Shadow''', is a mysterious woman encountered by [[Jorah Mormont]] in [[Qarth]]. Like [[Melisandre]], Quaithe is a [[shadowbinder]] from the fabled city of [[Asshai]] in the far east of Essos, and seems to wield magical powers of prophecy and clairvoyance.

==Biography==
===Background===
Quaithe is a mysterious woman hailing from the [[Shadow Lands]] beyond [[Asshai]] in the far east.{{Ref|GOT207}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Quaithe is present in [[Qarth]] after the arrival of [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and her ''[[khalasar]]''. After the young [[Khaleesi]] witnesses a feat of [[magic]] performed by the [[Warlocks|warlock]] [[Pyat Pree]] and is taken away by [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]], Quaithe approaches [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] and warns him of the men that might covet Daenerys's [[dragon]]s.{{Ref|GOT205}}

[[File:Quaithe painting.jpg|thumb|Quaithe paints designs of protection on a sailor.]]

Following the theft of the dragons, Jorah seeks out Quaithe. He finds her painting a sailor to protect him while passing across the [[Smoking Sea|shattered]] [[Valyrian peninsula]], where [[Doom of Valyria|the Doom]] is said to still hold sway. She tells Jorah that Daenerys is with the person that stole her dragons while she is meeting with the [[Thirteen]]. During the meeting Pyat Pree reveals himself as the thief. He pronounces Xaro the [[King of Qarth]] and murders the other members of the council using his magic before repeating an invitation to visit the [[House of the Undying]].{{Ref|GOT207}}

==Behind the scenes==
According to costume designer [[Michele Clapton]], Quaithe's mask was designed to display a stylistic link to [[Melisandre]], because both of them are from the region of [[Asshai]]. Melisandre wears an ornate neck piece featuring a repeated design motif of elongated hexagons. Quaithe's mask was constructed using the same hexagonal shapes as links, though filled in with metal. Further, the dresses of both Melisandre and Quaithe have the same hexagonal design motif (elongated so they are taller than they are wide), though the pattern on Melisandre's dress is solid red on black and more difficult to see.<ref>"A Man Without Honor" HBO featurette</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Quaithe is an enigmatic [[shadowbinder]], preferring to speak in riddles and prophecies. She hides her true features behind a dark red, [[Wikipedia:Lacquer|lacquered]] mask of wood, as do many people from the [[Shadow Lands]].

In the books, Quaithe first meets [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] in the [[Red Waste]]. When Daenerys's scout [[Rakharo|Jhogo]] returns from [[Qarth]], Quaithe, [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]], and [[Pyat Pree]] accompany him to meet Daenerys, and invite her to the city.{{Bookref|ACOK|12}} Quaithe then continues with Daenerys's group to Qarth itself.{{Bookref|ACOK|27}} The TV series simplifies this so Daenerys simply meets Quaithe when she actually arrives at Qarth. Daenerys encounters Quaithe several more times during her stay in Qarth, during which the shadowbinder explains that [[magic]] has made an unexpected return in the weeks since the [[dragon]]s' birth. Quaithe also urges Daenerys to leave Qarth as soon as possible and visit [[Asshai]], saying cryptically: ''"To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow"''.{{Bookref|ACOK|40}} Daenerys is reluctant to trust her, however, recalling her unpleasant experience with [[Mirri Maz Duur]].

When Daenerys is in [[Astapor]], Quaithe appears in her cabin seemingly in a dream, repeats her mysterious words, then disappears.{{Bookref|ASOS|27}}

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Quaithe appears once more before Daenerys, delivering another cryptic warning: "''The [[Glass candle]]s are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame,  lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal''".{{Bookref|ADWD|11}} As the plot progresses, most of the items in the warning are revealed to the readers:
*The "pale mare" is another name for the fatal disease known as the bloody flux, carried to [[Meereen]] by refugees from Astapor.
*The [[House Greyjoy|kraken]] and [[Lord of Light|dark flame]] are Victarion Greyjoy and the [[red priest]] Moqorro (whose role is generally taken by [[Kinvara]]), who are sailing to Meereen.
*The [[House Lannister|lion]] is [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], who currently is at the [[Yunkai]] camp surrounding Meereen.
*The [[House Martell|sun's son]] is Quentyn Martell (omitted from the show), who arrives at Meereen before Daenerys departs.
*The [[House Connington|griffin]] and mummer's [[House Targaryen|dragon]] are the presumed-dead [[Jon Connington]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)]] (both are considered dead in the show); they first appear in the fifth novel, and do not get involved in the current events at the [[Slaver's Bay]], but instead come to Westeros with the [[Golden Company]]. Quaithe's warning about them seems to be more long-ranged than the other items.
*It is uncertain who or what "the perfumed seneschal" is. There are various fan speculations about the phrase, among them: [[Varys]], Reznak mo Reznak, the ship ''Selaesori Qhoran'' (meaning "fragrant steward").

At the end of the fifth novel, Daenerys is wandering lost, starving, and alone in the Dothraki Sea. She slips into a restless sleep and hears Quaithe's original instructions again. She then sees Quaithe, whose mask is made of starlight, and the stars whisper in a woman's voice: ''"Remember who you are, Daenerys. The dragons know. Do you?"''{{Bookref|ADWD|71}}
