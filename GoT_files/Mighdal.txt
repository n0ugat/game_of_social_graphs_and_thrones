{{Quote|Before you freed me I belonged to Master Mighdal.|[[Fennesz]] to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]|The Children}}
Master '''Mighdal''' is one of the former [[Great Masters]] of the city of [[Meereen]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Mighdal owned a slave named [[Fennesz]], who was tasked with educating the children of the household. After [[Daenerys Targaryen]] took the city and freed all the slaves, Fennesz asked her to be allowed to re-sell himself into slavery, as Mighdal and his family had treated him well. The queen allowed for Fennesz and Mighdal to sign a contract of employment, but only for a period of one year at a time.{{Ref|GOT410}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Mighdal. His name was chosen by [[D.B. Weiss]] in honor of his beloved childhood friend David Migdal.

The characters of Mighdal and Fennesz were invented to present a problem alluded to in the books, the plight of slaves whose lives actually worsened with freedom.
