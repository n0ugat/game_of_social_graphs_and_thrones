Lady '''Talla Tarly''' is the only daughter of late [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Randyll Tarly]] of [[Horn Hill]] and the middle child between [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] and [[Dickon Tarly]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Talla was born at Horn Hill to Randyll and [[Melessa Tarly]]. She is the sister of Sam and Dickon.{{Ref|GOT606}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Sam is en route to the [[Citadel]] to study about the [[White Walkers]]. Since the Citadel does not accept women and children, he plans to send [[Gilly]] and her baby [[Sam]] to live with his family at Horn Hill. While he does not get on with his father, he gets on with Talla and their mother Melessa.{{Ref|GOT603}}

Talla eagerly greets Sam as he arrives with Gilly and her baby, complaining about her arranged marriage to the old, yellow-toothed [[Symun Fossoway]]. Talla takes Gilly under her wing and starts musing on what color she would look best in. She also offers to put Gilly up in one of her bedrooms.{{Ref|GOT606}}

At dinner, Talla makes small talk with Gilly, and is impressed that Gilly can hunt for herself, as Randyll never saw the need for her to learn. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a [[Free Folk|wildling]], Melessa listens to his rant before giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow.{{Ref|GOT606}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
With the deaths of her father and Dickon in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], and with Sam unable to inherit as both a man of the [[Night's Watch]] and a [[Order of Maesters|maester]]-in-training, Talla becomes the Lady of Horn Hill and head of House Tarly.{{Ref|GOT705}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Talla has been briefly mentioned as Sam's sister but otherwise not described in detail and has not yet appeared. She has not been betrothed to anyone.

Randyll has five children: his eldest child Sam, then three daughters, and finally his second son Dickon. After he became dissatisfied with the bookish Sam as a child, he kept having more children with his wife, until they produced another son to replace him. Talla is the eldest of Sam's three sisters (the other two haven't been named).
