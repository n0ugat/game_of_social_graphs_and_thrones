{{Quote|I wish to spill blood, not ink.|Aegon II Targaryen|Rhaenyra the Cruel}}
King '''Aegon II Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Āegon II Targārien''}} is the sixth [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]] and [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms]]. His rule is disputed by his older half-sister, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. He is the firstborn son of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and his second wife, Queen [[Alicent Hightower]], and a member of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]]. He is the [[Dragonrider|rider]] of the [[dragon]] [[Sunfyre]].{{Guideref|Sunfyre}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Aegon was born in [[113 AC]],{{Dateref|Aegon II Targaryen}} roughly a year after his parents' marriage in King's Landing and the tenth year of his father's rule. He has an elder half-sister, Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], the daughter of King Viserys's first wife, Queen [[Aemma Arryn]], and three younger full siblings through his mother Alicent: Princess [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]], Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], and Prince [[Daeron Targaryen]].{{Guideref|Character Guide}}

Until his sudden ascension to the throne orchestrated by the [[Green Council]], Aegon was seventh-in-line to succeed to the [[Iron Throne]], after Rhaenyra and her five children and his half-nephews, Princes [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], and [[Joffrey Velaryon]], and Princes [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon Targaryen the Younger]] and Prince [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys Targaryen]].{{Guideref|Character Guide}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:SOHN Aegon and Viserys.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon on his second nameday.]]
The realm celebrates Aegon's second [[nameday]] with a royal hunt in the [[Kingswood]]. During a gathering shortly before the hunt, [[Hobert Hightower]] pressures his brother [[Otto Hightower|Otto]]—who serves as the [[Hand of the King]]—to convince Viserys to name Aegon his heir. Hobert later openly hails the prince as "Aegon the Conqueror-Babe, Second of His Name."{{Ref|HOTD103}}

During the outing, the [[Royal Huntsman]] tracks a [[white hart]], considered a [[magic]]al creature and a symbol of royalty, contributing to Viserys's doubts about previously naming Rhaenyra his heir in a very public ceremony. To the king's relief, however, the stag that they finally catch is not a white one.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

When Otto proposes a marriage between Aegon and Rhaenyra, this at first amuses then angers the king, who is already exhausted with the constant politicking by his [[Small Council]] and the other lords present, including [[Jason Lannister]] who brazenly declares his assumption that Aegon will soon be named heir.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

The day after the hunt, Otto pressures Alicent to discuss the succession with Viserys. She does not bring up the subject in her next conversation with him, however.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

[[File:KOTNS Mummer's Farce Still.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mummers spread the sentiment that Aegon is the rightful heir.]]
The following year, Rhaenyra and her uncle [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] watch a [[Mummers|mummer's farce]] about the succession performed on the [[Street of Silk]] in [[King's Landing]]. The majority of the spectators appear to favor Aegon as heir, echoing the lead mummer's question that Rhaenyra would be a feeble queen.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

After being dismissed as [[Hand of the King]], Otto bluntly tells Alicent that if Rhaenyra inherits the throne, war will follow and Alicent and her children will be put to the sword. He urges her to prepare Aegon to rule.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Ten years later, a now teenaged Aegon accompanies his brother Aemond and Rhaenyra's sons Jacaerys and Lucerys Velaryon to the [[Dragonpit]], and watches as Jace is trained by the [[Dragonkeepers]] to command his young dragon [[Vermax]]. Aegon, Jace, and Luke tell Aemond, the only boy yet without a [[dragon]], that they found one for him. The three boys then bring out a pig that they have decorated with wings and make fun of Aemond with squealing noises. Aegon is later scolded in private by his mother, who tells him that he must treat his brother respectfully in public, for one day he will be king. When Aegon claims that he has no plans to challenge Rhaenyra's succession, Alicent rebukes him, telling her son that he himself already is the challenge, and that Rhaenyra will have to kill him and his brother to secure her claim.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

[[File:TPATQ Aegon and Jacaerys.png|thumb|250px|left|Aegon fights Jace.]]
Aegon later trains in the courtyard of the [[Red Keep]] alongside Aemond, Jace, and Luke under Ser [[Criston Cole]]. Aegon demonstrates proficiency with a sword against a strawman, but he and Aemond are easily bested by Criston. Criston later has Aegon knock Jace to the ground and relentlessly attack him, but Ser [[Harwin Strong]] intervenes, grabbing Aegon and pushing him aside, angering the young [[prince]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

[[File:Aegon and Aemond Driftmark.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aegon laments his betrothal to his sister, Helaena.]]
Aegon is present alongside Viserys, Alicent, Helaena, Aemond, and the rest of the royal family for the funeral of his aunt, [[Laena Velaryon]], at [[Driftmark]]. During the funeral reception after, Aegon and his brother watch their sister Helaena study a spider, and they argue over Aegon's betrothal to and dislike of their sister, with him stating Helaena is an idiot and that they have nothing in common. Aemond defends Helaena by reminding Aegon that she is their sister and his future queen. When Aegon suggests Aemond should marry Helaena if he is willing to defend her, Aemond says that if he were betrothed to Helaena, he would do his duty to keep their Valyrian blood pure. Aegon finishes the argument by quipping that he and Helaena do share at least an attraction to things with long legs, before grabbing more wine and leaving to flirt with a servant.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Aegon continues to get drunk on wine through the funeral reception into the evening. He is eventually found by his grandfather, Ser Otto Hightower, inebriated on a flight of steps near the reception area. Exasperated at his behavior, Otto roughly grabs Aegon, who in his drunken confusion believes him to be his brother. Otto then drags Aegon back to the reception area and sends him to bed, while his brother Aemond and the assembled court look on.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

[[File:DM Aegon and Viserys I Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon confesses to his father that everyone knows about the illegitimacy of Rhaenyra's children.]]
Later that evening, Aegon is present in the [[Hall of Nine]] with his mother and sister, as Aemond's eye injury is tended to by [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Kelvyn]], while Viserys angrily questions his [[Kingsguard]] how they allowed the fight between his son and his grandchildren and nieces to happen. Alicent then angrily confronts Aegon on where he was before slapping and reprimanding him for getting drunk while his brother was harmed. When calls on Aemond to tell him where he heard the rumors about Jace and Luke's parentage, Aemond reluctantly says Aegon told him, baffling Aegon. When Viserys questions Aegon on where he heard the rumors, Aegon's only defense to his father's questioning is that everyone knows based on Jace and Luke's non-Valyrian features.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

The following day, Aegon departs with his family from Driftmark, riding on his dragon Sunfyre, alongside Helaena on [[Dreamfyre]] and Aemond on [[Vhagar]] as they return home to King's Landing.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

At some point after this, Aegon and Helaena are wed to each other and have two children, [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Six years after Laena's funeral, Aegon rapes a household servant named [[Dyana]] as she is serving him wine. Furious, Alicent goes to see her son, who is lying in bed naked and heavily drunk. When Aegon says that he viewed it as "harmless fun" and that Dyana did not need to get upset, Alicent yells at him to stop with his raping and lude behaviour as he is shaming their family. Aegon accuses his mother of wanting too much from him, and that despite how much pressure she and his father put on him, it will never be enough for them.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[File:TLOTT Criston, Aegon, Aemond, Helaena, Alicent & Otto.png|thumb|250px|right|Aegon with his family in the Great Hall.]]
Later, Aegon and his family hear the petitions of [[Vaemond Velaryon]] and Rhaenyra, on behalf of Lucerys, over the succession to Driftmark. Aegon smiles when Viserys reaffirms Lucerys's right to Driftmark and is surprised when his uncle Daemon kills Vaemond for calling Rhaenyra's sons bastards.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[File:TLOTT Lucerys & Aegon.png|thumb|250px|left|Aegon drunkenly brawls with Luke.]]
Viserys gets the entire Targaryen family together for dinner that night. Fed up with Aegon, Alicent toasts Rhaenyra and says that she will be a fine queen. Aegon harasses Jace about his betrothal to their cousin [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]], joking that he can teach Jace about sex. When Aegon goes to flirt with Baela, Jace stands up but quickly calms himself and toasts his uncles. Helaena adds in, toasting Baela and Rhaena and indirectly taunting Aegon about their marriage. Aegon is further annoyed when Jace dances with Helaena. At the end of the feast, when a fight breaks out between Aemond and Jace, Aegon joins in by hitting Luke's head against the table before Alicent, Rhaenyra, and Daemon break the fight up.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

On his deathbed, Viserys, thinking he is talking to Rhaenyra, tells Alicent that [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]]'s [[The Song of Ice and Fire|prophetic dream]] is true and that she will be the one to save the realm. Believing that Viserys means their son, Alicent is reinvigorated in her goal to get Aegon on the throne.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

What Alicent does not know, however, is that members of the [[Small Council]], including her father, have been plotting to put Aegon on the throne for years despite Viserys's steadfast support of Rhaenyra. When their plans are complete, the king-to-be is nowhere to be found. Otto sends [[Arryk Cargyll|Arryk]] and [[Erryk Cargyll]] to find Aegon and bring the prince to him, while Alicent sends Criston Cole and Aemond to find him for the same purpose.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Aegon's bastard.png|thumb|250px|right|A bastard child fathered by Aegon.]]
While in a fighting pit that enslaves young children, Arryk and Erryk find a child who they believe is one of Aegon's bastards. Eventually, they are approached by [[Jayne]], a woman who claims to know where Aegon is, and they are taken to her employer [[Mysaria]], also known as the White Worm. She reveals to Otto that she orchestrated the kidnapping of Aegon the previous night, and tells the Cargylls where to find him in exchange for the Crown cracking down on the child fighting pits.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Aemond and Aegon Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon attempts to flee being crowned.]]
They travel to the [[Grand Sept]], where they find Aegon asleep underneath a shrine. When they go outside with the drunken prince to bring him to Otto, they are stopped by Criston and Aemond, who had picked up their trail. Aegon tries to escape, but Aemond tackles him. Aegon is shocked to learn from his brother that his mother and her allies have plotted to make him king, and expresses his wish to leave Westeros to stay out of everyone's political games. When Aemond puts him in a headlock, Aegon loudly pronounces that he is unfit to rule and he doesn't want the crown.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Aegon and Alicent Still.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aegon and Alicent on their way to the coronation.]]
Regardless of his wishes, Aegon's coronation takes place the next day in the Dragonpit. On the way there, he questions his mother on whether Viserys's alleged wish for Aegon to succeed him is genuine, as he had refused to name Aegon his heir for twenty years, even over the blood of his relatives. Alicent presents him with Viserys's [[Valyrian steel dagger]], but Aegon, after being told not to kill Rhaenyra as Otto wishes, asks if his mother truly loves him, to which she replies "you imbecile."{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Aegon II Coronation Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon relishes in the cheers of the smallfolk as he is crowned.]]
Aegon is anointed by [[Septon]] [[Eustace]] and crowned by Criston Cole with his ancestor Aegon the Conqueror's [[crown]] as King Aegon II, usurping Rhaenyra. He turns to see the crowd cheering for him. He draws [[Blackfyre]], the ancestral sword of House Targaryen, and starts to celebrate his new, previously unwanted, kingship. But at that point, Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] bursts through the floor astride her dragon [[Meleys]], and Alicent steps in front of Aegon to protect him, but Rhaenys spares Aegon and his family and flees to [[Dragonstone]] to warn Rhaenyra.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:ASFAS Aegon Small Council.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aegon attends the Small Council with Jaehaerys.]]
Aegon visits the royal chamber of his sister-wife [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]], looking for his young son, Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]]. Upon realizing the child present with Helaena is his daughter, Princess [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]], Aegon asks Helaena where Jaehaerys is. When she asks why he needs him, Aegon announces his intention to take Jaehaerys with him to the [[Green Council|Small Council]], so he can learn, as the heir and future king, to rule. Helaena reacts awkwardly and says Jaehaerys might not want to be king one day, but reluctantly informs her brother-husband that Jaehaerys is in the castle library, as is his custom. As he leaves, Helaena says she is afraid: Aegon reassures her the [[Blacks]] would not dare attack the city with [[Vhagar]] present, but Helaena clarifies she's scared of the "rats." This confuses Aegon and her handmaids, as there are no rats around. Aegon jokes that his queen is "an enduring mystery" and departs.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Aegon finds and brings Jaehaerys with him to a following meeting of the Small Council. He is displeased when [[Otto Hightower]] informs him that the [[North]] and the [[Vale of Arryn]] have ignored his diplomatic embassies, insulting Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]] and Lord [[Cregan Stark]] as "c***s." Aegon pays little interest in the following proceedings, being more amused at watching Jaehaerys annoy Ser [[Tyland Lannister]] by stealing his marble of office. When Tyland begs someone to intercede, Aegon suggests Tyland should perhaps give Jaehaerys a pony ride. Dowager Queen Alicent intercedes, insisting there is important business to conduct, and Aegon grudgingly concedes, sending Jaehaerys off with one of his retainers.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Once Jaehaerys departs, the discussion turns to the [[Velaryon fleet]]'s [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]] of the [[Gullet]] and the strain it is putting on commerce in King's Landing. Aegon bitterly questions why they didn't just kill Rhaenyra when they had the chance; Otto, after briefly glaring at Alicent, who countermanded his plans to do just that, replies that the opportunity has been lost. The session is interrupted by the intrusion of [[Aemond]]; when Alicent asks what Aemond is doing, as he has no seat on the Council, Aegon clarifies that he invited Aemond to attend. When Aemond proposes seizing [[Harrenhal]] as a toehold for the Greens in the [[Riverlands]], Aegon suggests he and Aemond take Vhagar and [[Sunfyre]] to force Lord [[Grover Tully]] and the Riverlords into submission, and destroy the Velaryon blockade as an afterthought. Alicent and Ser [[Criston Cole]] both protest this plan; Criston citing Aegon would personally be exposing himself to the dangers of the battlefield, while Alicent insists Vhagar is needed to defend King's Landing from any retaliatory attack Rhaenyra might send to avenge her son [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]]'s death. Displeased, Aegon broods as Otto assures him their continuing diplomatic efforts will bear fruit, as tradition and historical precedent will bring more lords to his side.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

[[File:2x1 Aegon and Otto Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Aegon attends court with Otto Hightower.]]
Later that day, Aegon strides into the throne room, flanked by two knights of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] and his cronies [[Martyn Reyne]], [[Leon Estermont]] and [[Eddard Waters]] to preside over a session of court for the smallfolk. Reyne announces him as "Aegon the Magnanimous," baffling the King as to that particular word choice. The first petitioner is a shepherd called [[Jerard]], who is clearly nervous at being before the King, for which Aegon gently reassures him he has no need to be. Jerard explains that the crown has taken a tenth of his flock, but this is a hardship now that summer has just ended. Aegon is willing to give him back his sheep, but Otto interjects that they recently started a tithe on all flocks in the Crownlands because their dragons need to eat more when they are more active in wartime or on patrol, and if Aegon returns one shepherd's flock, the rest will all want the same. Aegon still meekly asks if they could just give this one shepherd his flock back, because he came all this way and Aegon would appear callous to deny him, but Otto insists he must. Annoyed, Aegon has Jerard removed.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

The next petitioner is a guildmaster, who explains the Velaryon fleet's blockade is disrupting shipments of salt from [[Essos]] needed to preserve food ahead of winter. Aegon dismisses the man by insisting he will soon send Vhagar to destroy the blockade. The third petitioner, a blacksmith named [[Hugh]], asks that the city's smiths be paid in advance for their work, as their time is being taken up building [[scorpion]]s to bolster the city's defenses, meaning they cannot take other work to support themselves. Aegon agrees, and overrides Otto's attempt to protest, insisting his cause's victory relies on the support of the smallfolk.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

On his way back to his chambers after the court session, Aegon is intercepted by Lord [[Larys Strong]]. Larys obsequiously flatters the king by comparing his dealings with the smallfolk to the deft touch of his father and great-grandfather King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]], and requests a private word. On a nearby balcony, Larys suggest Aegon might want to find a more forceful Hand than Otto, lest he is seen as his grandfather's puppet the same way Viserys was, giving Aegon pause.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

[[File:2x1 Aegon Ned and Leon Still.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Aegon drinks with Ned Waters and Leon Estermont.]]
Later that evening, Aegon lollops on the Iron Throne and drinks with his cronies, complaining that his grandfather and mother insist on smothering him, but praising Aemond's loyalty, as well as insisting he needs a new style, as none of the smallfolk know what "magnanimous" means, and he and his cronies bandy about potential new titles for him, oblivious to a [[Blood and Cheese|pair of rat catchers]] passing through the throne room.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Later that night, Aegon's son, Jaehaerys, is [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murdered]] in retaliation for Lucerys. Upon being informed, a furious, grief-stricken Aegon smashes his father's model of [[Old Valyria]] to pieces, swearing vengeance on his son's killers, despite Martyn and Eddard's best efforts to calm him down. At a hastily convened session of the Green Council, a furious Aegon demands to know where his councilors were while their king was being threatened; when Tyland Lannister blithely asks if the king himself actually had been threatened, Aegon roars that he could easily have been the assassins' target, smashing Tyland's wine cup from his hand, before berating Criston for failing in his duties as [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] to protect the royal family. Otto reassures Aegon they will find the person responsible, to which an astounded Aegon rages that Otto would consider the culprit is anyone other than Rhaenyra. He screams curses and insults at his half-sister, throwing a wine cup at the wall, before rounding on his mother, reminding Alicent she counseled him to spare Rhaenyra's life{{Ref|HOTD109}}.  When Larys interrupts to inform them that the City Watch have caught [[Blood|one]] of Jaehaerys's killers, Aegon declares he'll execute the man personally, but Otto countermands him and order Larys to interrogate the man further. Aegon is displeased, insisting they know their enemy, and when Lord [[Jasper Wylde]] insists they need to be sure Jaehaerys's murder was Rhaenyra's handiwork and not that of some unknown enemy, Aegon insinuates that any member of his council might be traitors.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

When Otto declares his intention to spread word of the Prince's death across the realm to blame Rhaenyra for his murder, Aegon outright refuses, wanting no word of his son's murder to leave the Red Keep, leest he be seen as weak. Otto counters that Aegon is already seen as weak, prompting a furious outburst directed at him from the King. Once Aegon has subsided, Otto explains that the [[Coup in King's Landing|haste of his coronation]] and the devastation [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and [[Meleys]] wrought at the event is being seen as some by an omen that Rhaenyra should have been Queen. [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] concludes that Otto intends to brand Rhaenyra a child-killer to counter such whispers on the streets. Otto continues that he intends to give Jaehaerys a public funeral progress, attended by his grieving mother and grandmother, so the smallfolk and the realm can see for themselves. Aegon flatly refuses, appalled at the idea of making a public spectacle of his son's death, but Otto insists it would be an honored procession for Jaehaerys, culminating with his cremation at the [[Dragonpit]] as befitting a Targaryen prince. Otto adds that the Great Houses who have declared for Rhaenyra might rethink their allegiances when they learn what she is capable of, assuring Aegon that allowing this will increase his support in the coming war. Aegon looks to his mother, who gently speaks in favor of the plan. Once Otto agrees the King should be spared attending such a spectacle, Aegon gives his consent.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Following Larys completing his interrogation of Blood, Aegon comes to Blood's cell and personally executes him with a mace.{{Ref|HOTD202}} Following Jaehaerys's funeral procession, Aegon encounters his sister-wife Helaena on the stairs; the pair exchange a look but Aegon, not knowing what to say to her in the wake of their son's death, walks past her in silence.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

At some point, Larys informs Aegon that Blood had an accomplice in killing his son [[Cheese|one of the Red Keep's rat catchers]]. Unable to identify the guilty individual, Aegon orders every one of the castle's rat catchers executed and their bodies hanged from the city walls as a warning. An appalled Otto, upon learning of this, storms into Aegon's personal chambers and demands an explanation. When Aegon blithely admits to ordering the executions, Otto berates him as an idiot. Ser [[Criston Cole]] rebukes Otto for his disrespectful tone, but Otto stands by his denunciation of his grandson, as Aegon's brutal action has destroyed any goodwill and sympathy the Greens gained from the smallfolk following Jaehaerys's murder (along with Otto's hard work to win it), and ensured the Great Houses backing Rhaenyra who might have wavered will stand firm with her now they've seen Aegon is just as cruel and vindictive. Aegon, announcing his desire to "''spill blood, not ink''," fires back that at least he and Criston have acted in response to his son's murder, as opposed to Otto's "''wailing and currying favor with the fishwives''", to which a wary Otto asks what Criston has done. Aegon replies that Criston has dispatched Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]] to [[Dragonstone]], disguised as [[Erryk Cargyll|his twin]], to infiltrate the castle and assassinate Rhaenyra. An appalled Otto castigates them both for not bothering to consult him or the Small Council with this ill-considered plan, which will only make them look like fools in their [[Blacks|enemy's]] eyes. Otto rebukes Aegon for not being more judicious, forbearing and dignified like his [[Viserys I Targaryen|late father]].{{Ref|HOTD202}}

"''Fuck dignity! I want revenge!''" Aegon insists, reminding Otto his father is dead. Otto agrees, noting that they are all poorer for the loss, and bitterly notes Viserys was right in believing Aegon unfit to be King. Angered, Aegon reminds Otto his father named him heir on his deathbed. Otto scoffs and sneers at his grandson, "''Is that what you think?''"{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Outraged, Aegon orders Otto to resign his position as [[Hand of the King]] and hand his badge of office over to Criston Cole. Otto scoffs that Aegon wouldn't dare replace him, but a smirking Aegon makes it clear he is being serious; Otto was his father's Hand and an old man besides, whereas his new Hand "will be a steel fist". Otto warns Aegon he will regret this hasty decision, throws his badge at Criston's feet and storms out.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Aegon appoints [[Martyn Reyne]], [[Leon Estermont]] and [[Eddard Waters]] to the Kingsguard to replace its lost members, chiefly Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]]. During a Small Council meeting, Aegon reacts approvingly to the [[Battle at the Burning Mill|recent confrontation]] between [[House Bracken]] and [[House Blackwood]], although [[Tyland Lannister]] doubts whether the battle was a true victory since both sides took heavy losses. When [[Jasper Wylde]] notes that the Blackwoods and the Brackens have always feuded for centuries, Aegon insists that they are truly in a war and that the [[Blacks]] will also consider it so. After asking what their next move would be, Cole proposes taking [[Harrenhal]], since it is the key to controlling the [[Riverlands]]. After some bickering, Aegon suggests [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] to take [[Vhagar]] to Harrenhal, an idea which Cole shoots down. Aegon proclaims "''to war, then''" and suggests to come along atop [[Sunfyre]]. Cole disapproves, not wanting to draw attention, while Aegon points out the danger if Rhaenyra's dragons were to show up at Harrenhal. Cole reacts by stating that they would be more likely to encounter one of the dragons if they bring one of their own. Aemond suggests Aegon to stay in [[King's Landing]], remarking that they cannot risk his loss. Aegon insists he is as fearsome as his enemies.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Later, Aegon is being fitted with the [[Valyrian steel]] armor of his namesake, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], preparing to fly out with Sunfyre. [[Larys  Strong]] enters, wishing to prevent Aegon from going into battle. Larys compliments the armor, to which Aegon replies that since he was given the Conqueror's name and crown, it is only right to wear his armor to war. Larys privately reveals certain rumors that have been spreading about Aegon; one being that he is out to fly to war, while another that he has been outwitted by his counselors and persuaded to fly to war with Cole so that Alicent and Aemond can reign in his absence. Unsettled by these supposed rumors, Aegon orders Larys to suppress them. He then names him [[Master of Whisperers]], a title that has been vacant during the reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]. Dejected, Aegon decides not to fly after all. After Ser Eddard Waters remarks that Ser Martyn has a new [[squire]] that needs "bedding in". Aegon remarks that, as Kingsguard, they are sworn to chastity, which they laughingly brush off. Aegon stares solemnly at them, putting them into silence.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

That night, Aegon accompanies Martyn's squire, as well as Ser Leon, Ser Eddard and Ser Martyn himself, to the [[Street of Silk]], hailed by [[Ulf]] and his friends. He announces drinks to all present at the pleasure of the Crown. He then drunkenly proceeds to a [[Sylvi's brothel|brothel]] looking for [[Sylvi]], where he happens upon Aemond lying with her. He laughs at his brother, proclaiming him "Aemond the Fierce" and mocking how, despite having come so far, he still prefers to lie with the first woman he has ever slept with. He continues to make ribald jokes at his expense. Aemond then leaves.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Aegon is angry after learning that [[Daemon Targaryen]] has [[Taking of Harrenhal|taken]] [[Harrenhal]], claiming that it proved his point right about not sending any [[dragon]]s there. He chastises Larys for his supposed failure, stating that it is his castle after all. Larys points out that Harrenhal is a crippled ruin of little value, penniless since Larys still controls all of its lands' gold. He suggests letting Daemon hold Harrenhal while they continue campaigning in the [[Crownlands]], cutting Rhaenyra's influence from the mainland. Aegon demands to be informed of the decisions made by his Small Council, refusing to be seen as a fool by his allies. Aemond echoes Larys's statements, revealing that Cole is marching towards [[Rook's Rest]], the seat of [[House Staunton]], whose lord [[Simon Staunton]] is a member of Rhaenyra's [[Black Council]], explaining it so after Aegon claims that Rook's Rest is pointless to capture. Aegon rejects Aemond's plan, preferring to retake Harrenhal instead. Aemond ignores him, as Cole is already preparing his [[Battle at Rook's Rest|attack]]. Aegon is aggrieved when he learns that Aemond and Cole had been plotting without his knowledge or consent. Aemond responds in [[High Valyrian]], mockingly chiding Aegon's preferred interest in cavorting [[Martyn Reyne|with]] [[Leon Estermont|his]] [[Eddard Waters|friends]]. He asks whether Aegon has a wiser strategy to voice to the council. Aegon, in his broken High Valyrian, wants to make war. Aegon is dejected when Aemond proceeds with his own plan.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

At the next Small Council meeting, Aegon's counselors discuss the dwindling resources to keep [[Vhagar]] fed, while remarking how they have become a formidable opponent with Cole and his men ensuring victories such as the [[Sack of Duskendale|taking]] of [[Duskendale]]. Aegon angrily slams his marble of office and proclaims that they all bore him. He promptly leaves.{{Ref|HOTD204}}
[[File:Aegon II flying Sunfyre.jpg|thumb|250px|Aegon II flying [[Sunfyre]]. ]]
He returns to his chambers where he meets Alicent, looking for Viserys's books. Aegon explains he had them removed, to which Alicent chides him for throwing away potentially useful knowledge. Aegon rebukes that he merely removed them from his chambers, not burnt them. Aegon confides in his mother that his counselors do not care about his input or thoughts. Alicent, slightly annoyed, wonders what thoughts Aegon could have, to which he replies that he is the king. Alicent rebuffs that simply wearing a crown does not grant Aegon wisdom. She points out that the members of his Small Council earned their seats through experience and knowledge. She hoped that Aegon, upon his coronation, would honor the burden of his office in silence and strive to learn from the more studied minds around him, in the hope that he could be half the king his father was. Aegon warns his mother to tread carefully, a threat which she rebukes, mocking his decision to hang the ratcatchers and banishing [[Otto Hightower]]. Alicent demands Aegon to listen to the advice of his counselors, claiming she had to make sacrifices to put him on the throne. Aegon asks his mother what he should do, to which Alicent answers that he should simply do what is needed of him: nothing. Aegon is clearly hurt by his mother's comments.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

[[File:Sunfyre and Meleys fight.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Aegon atop Sunfyre during the battle]]
As the battle of Rook's Rest draws nearer, Aegon angrily decides to fly out after all. He dons the Conqueror's armor and mounts Sunfyre. His presence forces Aemond to lay low with Vhagar after Cole lights the signal arrows for him to attack. Aegon attacks [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] atop [[Meleys]]. Rhaenys's dragon tears into Sunfyre's belly with her talons, causing him to fall from the sky and nearly crash nearly forces him to crash. Aegon flies back up but is attacked yet again by Meleys, who clamps her jaws around Sunfyre's right wing, forcing Aegon to hold on for dear life as the two dragons battle. Vhagar eventually appears from the forest, flying towards the two battling dragons. Sunfyre breaks off one of Meleys's horns, and Aegon is relieved to see Vhagar seemingly coming to his aid. Aemond, instead, orders Vhagar to fire upon the two; Aegon, realizing his brother's intention, can only scream in denial as Vhagar's fiery breath engulfs him and Sunfyre, sending them both plummeting down to crash-land in the forests surrounding Rook's Rest.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

After Rhaenys's death and the [[Greens]]' victory, the wounded Cole makes his way to where Aegon crashed, seeing Aemond sheathing his blade near a critically-injured Sunfyre, who has encircled himself around the unconscious Aegon.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

[[File:Aegon lies injured.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aegon lies grievously injured after the Battle of Rook's Rest.]]
Aegon is placed inside a wooden casket covered with blankets as the head of [[Meleys]] is paraded through the streets of [[King's Landing]]. He is returned to his chambers where [[Orwyle]] and several other maesters attend to his wounds. They remove his armor plate by plate, which had been melted onto his skin and fix his broken bones. Alicent enters and expresses her concern for Aegon's injuries. Orwyle is unsure whether he will survive, and that the next hours are most critical.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

During Aegon's incapacitation, the Small Council elects [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] to act as [[Regent]] and [[Protector of the Realm]] in his absence. Orwyle notes that it is likely Aegon will never wake again. Later, Alicent sits with Aegon but leaves as Aegon softly calls out to her.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Orwyle announces to the Small Council that Aegon has regained consciousness. He is convinced that Aegon will survive. Aemond visits him while the maesters are cleaning his bandages, dismissing everyone present. Aemond questions Aegon about his memory of the events at [[Battle at Rook's Rest|Rook's Rest]], to which Aegon replies that he remembers nothing. Aemond presses the glass sphere of his office on Aegon's fresh wounds, causing him considerable pain. Aemond insists that Aegon foolishly tried to challenge [[Meleys]], yet Aegon still asserts that he remembers nothing. Aemond kisses his brother on the head and leaves when Orwyle enters, suggesting that Aegon still has a long recovery ahead of him, and that he needs to rest comfortably.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Alicent sits with a dazed Aegon in his chambers. Orwyle arrives, and when Alicent questions him on her son's recovery, Orwyle notes that Aegon sleeps nine of every ten hours, but he can still briefly open his eyes and speak. He believes his recovery will be long and painful, but that he will live nonetheless. Alicent asks him what Aegon will become if he lives, but Orwyle does not answer. After Orwyle leaves, Alicent whispers "I'm sorry" to her son.{{Ref|HOTD206}}
[[File:2x8 Aegon and Larys Still.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aegon and [[Larys Strong|Larys]] at his bed.]]When Aegon is offered [[milk of the poppy]] by a maidservant, [[Larys Strong]] objects, ordering her to give the king his draught in an hour. He says to Aegon that while the milk takes his pain away, it also dulls his mind. He assures Aegon that he has been written into legend because he survived dragonfire, but he also relents that Aegon will never again be whole despite Orwyle's abilities, much to the king's grief. He insists that Aegon's mind is all that will remain to him. Larys recounts to Aegon the circumstances of his birth defect, and tearfully tells Aegon that people will pity him and stare at him behind his back, or turn away in disgust altogether. However, Larys also advises that people will underestimate Aegon, and that this could become his advantage. As he prepares to leave, Aegon pleads to him. Larys tells the king that his life is in danger since Aemond now rules in his place. Aegon asks Larys to help him.{{Ref|HOTD206}}
[[File:Larys and Aegon flee.40.png|thumb|right|250px|Aegon and Larys flee the city.]]
Larys tells him about Rhaenyra's new dragonriders and Aemond's [[Burning of Sharp Point|decimating]] Sharp Point. He also warns that Aemond's rage is an even greater threat to Aegon's life. Aegon wants Aemond imprisoned, but Larys argues Aemond and Vhagar are essential assets to fighting the [[Dance of the Dragons|war]]. Aegon starts ranting about his dragon's death and his ruined body. Having moved the bulk of Harrenhal's gold to the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]], Larys proposes that he and Aegon hide in [[Essos]] and return and reclaim the throne after Aemond and Rhaenyra have destroyed each other.<ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 8: "[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]" (2024).</ref>

Later, Aegon and Larys secretly depart the city in a covered wagon.<ref name=":0" />

==Personality==
Unlike his namesake, Aegon is arrogant, hedonistic, lazy and impatient. He is shown to be a heavy drinker, and known to harass the serving women of the Red Keep for his own entertainment. As a teenager, he refused to behave as a prince is expected to, chasing after scullery maids and seeking pleasure, instead of learning about the kingdoms and how to fight.{{Guideref|Aegon II Targaryen}} He also resents his mother's efforts to control his behaviour, and feels that no matter what he does in his life, his mother will never be happy or proud of him, though he refuses to acknowledge his own faults.{{Ref|HOTD108}} Going so far as to ask his mother directly if she truly loves him.{{Ref|HOTD109}} He was known to bully his younger brother [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] even in his youth, and would also bully his nephews when the mood struck him.{{Ref|HOTD106}} He has a close bond with his dragon, [[Sunfyre]], having even taught the dragon most commands in the common tongue, though he lacks the ability to command well.{{Ref|HOTD204}} 

As king, he is eager to prove himself as a strong and decisive ruler, however this also makes him brash and impulsive.{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }} Instead of tempering his emotions he succumbs to them like a teenager and makes poor decisions that can backfire easily, such as hanging all the Red Keep's ratcatchers in order to kill one of the men responsible for his son's death. When confronted with his recklessness and shortcomings, he refuses to heed council and sees defiance against his power, leading him to remove Otto Hightower as his hand after Otto berated his poor choices.{{Ref|HOTD202}} Despite seemingly having no regard for the [[bastard]]s he fathered, Aegon loved his son [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] dearly, becoming devastated after [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|his death]], driving him to commit fully to [[Dance of the Dragons|war]] with [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. In his quest for war, he named [[Criston Cole]] as his new hand, wishing for a steel fist in place of his grandsire.{{Ref|HOTD202}}  

However, Aegon's drive masks deep insecurity and doubt in his ability to perform as a King. During moments on the throne, he seeks to earn the praise and goodwill of his subjects, but fails to see the tradeoffs a ruler has to make, making him appear dishonest and unwise.  He is hungry for approval in his subordinates and his mother, often chiding the [[Green Council]] when they make decisions without him such as planning to take [[Rook's Rest]].

==In the books==
[[File:Roman Papsuev - Aegon II Targaryen.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Aegon II Targaryen by Roman "Amok" Papsuev.©]]
[[File:Aegon II Targaryen H&L.svg|thumb|300px|right|Aegon's personal arms in the books has a black field, rather than green.]]
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Aegon II Targaryen was the first child of [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and [[Alicent Hightower]]. He had an older half-sister, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], and three younger full-siblings: [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]], [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], and [[Daeron Targaryen|Daeron]]. He was known to have a short temper and was slow to forgive perceived slights or failures.

Aegon, named after [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], was born in 106 AC in [[King's Landing]]. He resembled his father in appearance and was considered handsome, though his eyes had a sullen look and his mouth was pouty. Like his father he had a mustache, though his was wispy, while Viserys's was bushy.

From the moment of Aegon's birth, tensions began to fester in court and realm, as King Viserys was determined that his eldest daughter Rhaenyra would succeed him. [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]], Aegon's uncle, was cool towards him and his brother Aemond, supposedly because their births had pushed him further down the line of succession, though he would later become Rhaenyra's staunchest supporter. Alicent and her father [[Otto Hightower]] were the loudest voices in favor of Aegon being the king's heir. Otto pestered Viserys about the issue so much that the king stripped him of his office as [[Hand of the King]] and named [[Lyonel Strong]] in his stead. When Alicent proposed a marriage between Rhaenyra and Aegon, Viserys, knowing the motive behind the suggestion, had Rhaenyra married to [[Laenor Velaryon]] instead. The respective supporters of Aegon and Rhaenyra became known as the "queen's party" and the "party of the princess."

At Viserys and Alicent's fifth wedding anniversary, the queen's party and party of the princess became known as the [[greens]] and the [[blacks]] for the dresses that Alicent and Rhaenyra wore to the opening feast.

Alicent's sons and Rhaenyra's sons were forced to spend time together and bond, but they did not get along well due to the sentiment that [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], and [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] had stolen their birthright, and the rumors that the three boys were [[bastard]]s fathered by [[Harwin Strong]].

Aegon claimed [[Sunfyre]] by the age of 13, and at some point took a three-headed dragon gold on black as his personal sigil in his dragon's honor. In 120 AC, Rhaenyra and Daemon had a son they named [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]], which was perceived as a slight against the elder Prince Aegon intended to lessen the significance of his name and imply that he was less worthy of the Conqueror's name.

By the age of 15 he was a heavy drinker and a glutton, lazy and somewhat sulky. He was known to pinch and fondle any serving girl who strayed within his reach. At the same age he was married to his younger sister [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]], who gave birth to the twins [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]] a year later. Aegon also fathered numerous bastards during his marriage.

At a feast on the first day of 127 AC, Aegon took offense at Jacaerys asking Helaena for a dance. They argued and might have fought if the [[Kingsguard]] had not intervened. The same year Aegon and Helaena had another son named [[Maelor Targaryen|Maelor]]. 

A week after Viserys's death, who had secretly been left to rot in his room during that time while the Greens prepared for Aegon's coronation, Aegon was summoned to the [[Small Council|small council]]. However, he could not be found in his chambers. According to [[Munkun]]'s [[The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling|''True Telling'']], the prince was "at his revels." According to the testimony of the [[fool]] Mushroom, he was found drunk and naked in a [[Flea Bottom]] rat pit where feral children fought for his amusement, while he was being pleasured by a young girl. [[Septon]] [[Eustace]], known to portray Aegon in a more favorable light, claimed that Aegon was found abed with a well-kept [[paramour]], a wealthy trader's daughter. He initially refused the crown, but [[Criston Cole]] convinced him that he and his brothers would be executed if Rhaenyra should take the throne. According to Eustace this is the only reason Aegon agreed to be crowned.

Weary of the Greens' secrecy, Aegon demanded to be crowned immediately. He was anointed with the holy oils by Septon Eustace and crowned with Aegon the Conqueror's crown by Criston Cole in the [[Dragonpit]] on the tenth day of the third moon of 129 AC. 

Upon hearing of Rhaenyra's rival coronation at [[Dragonstone]], Aegon demanded her head as well as Daemon's. [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] offered to go to Dragonstone and offer peace terms to Rhaenyra; Aegon initially accused Orwyle of disloyalty and threatened the Grand Maester with imprisonment in the [[Black Cells]], but grudgingly conceded to Orwyle's proposal when Alicent and Helaena spoke in favor of it. Rhaenyra refused the greens' terms, and the war of succession that followed would later become known as the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

After Jaehaerys was murdered by [[Blood and Cheese]] in revenge for the death of Luke Velaryon, Aegon II was left furious and heartbroken over the loss of his eldest son and heir. Having learned that one of the assassins is a ratcatcher, he has all of the ratcatchers in the Red Keep's employ hanged, forcing Otto to bring in a hundred cats as replacements.

During the Dance of the Dragons, while the Blacks achieved a series of victories in the Riverlands, Otto tried to win allies with letters and hiring sellswords, only for Aegon to mistake his efforts as inaction and cowardly. Upon learning that Rhaenyra has secured the support of Houses Stark and Arryn and much of the Riverlands (the latter thanks to Daemon), Aegon would indulge himself in heavy drinking so as to drown his fears. Because his grandfather's ways of gaining allies is only delaying the Greens' chances of waging war, this was the last straw for Aegon, as he immediately stripped Otto of his title as Hand before giving it to Criston Cole.

As Aegon sought revenge on Rhaenyra for his son's death, he initially wanted to attack Dragonstone, Rhaenyra's base of operations, on his dragon Sunfyre, but was dissuaded by the Green council. He and Aemond participated in the Siege on Rook's Rest, in which they fought and killed Rhaenys and her dragon Meleys. However, this victory came at a cost for both King Aegon and Sunfyre; While the dragon was badly maimed and was left with a half-torn wing, half of Aegon's body is covered in burns and he was left with a broken hip and numerous broken ribs. The injury on his left arm was the most grievous, as his armor had melted into the skin.

Due to how grievous Aegon's injuries are, it would take a year for him to recover and he would remain bent and twisted for the rest of his life. During his recovery, Aegon began taking milk of the poppy daily, which clouded his mind, causing him to sleep nine hours out of every ten. Only Alicent and Aemond were allowed to disturb his rest. Because of his brother's current condition, Aemond began ruling the Seven Kingdoms as Prince Regent until Aegon is able to make a full recovery.
