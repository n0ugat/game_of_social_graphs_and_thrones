A '''dragon dream'''{{Webref|name=Condal |author=Elio Garcia |date=June 22, 2024 |url=https://www.westeros.org/News/Entry/New_Interview_with_Ryan_Condal |title=New Interview with Ryan Condal |website=Westeros.org |access-date=June 23, 2024}} is a type of [[Dreams and prophecies|prophetic dream or vision]] experienced by some individuals of [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] descent, who are called '''dreamers'''.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

==Known cases==
===Daenys Targaryen===
[[Daenys Targaryen]], known as "the Dreamer," was the daughter of the [[dragonlord]] [[Aenar Targaryen]] of the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. She is remembered for having foreseen the [[Doom of Valyria]] in a dream twelve years before it happened, causing her father to relocate the family and its [[dragon]]s to [[Dragonstone]], thus securing [[House Targaryen]]'s future as the last known dragonlord family in the world and the rulers of the [[Seven Kingdoms]].{{Ref|H&L706}}{{Ref|C&R01}}

===Aegon I Targaryen===
{{Main|The Song of Ice and Fire}}
[[Aegon I Targaryen]] experienced a dream he called "[[The Song of Ice and Fire]]." In it, he predicted the return of the [[White Walkers]], and that the [[Prince That Was Promised]] would be born from his line. After this dream, Aegon started [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]] to unify the Seven Kingdoms and prepare for the coming [[Great War]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===Viserys I Targaryen===
[[Viserys I Targaryen]], the fifth [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]], dreamt of his son being born wearing the iron crown of Aegon the Conqueror, amidst the clashing of swords, charging of cavalry, and roaring of dragons.{{Ref|HOTD101}} This prophecy comes true when his son [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] is crowned with the Conqueror's crown at the beginning of the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

This was the only dragon dream Viserys ever saw; he tried night after night to see it again, to no avail.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

===Helaena Targaryen===
[[Helaena Targaryen]], Viserys I's younger daughter, is constantly plagued by prophetic visions.

While overhearing a conversation between [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], in which Alicent assures Aemond that he will have a dragon one day, Helaena mutters to herself: "He'll have to close an eye."{{Ref|HOTD106}} Aemond loses an eye after claiming [[Vhagar]] mere days later.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Helaena prophesies "Hand turns loom; spool of [[Greens|green]], spool of [[Blacks|black]]; dragons of flesh weaving dragons of thread."{{Ref|HOTD107}} "Hand turns loom" may refer to [[Otto Hightower]], the King's Hand, seizing power and setting the [[Dance of the Dragons]] into motion six years later.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

In another instance, Helaena warns her family repeatedly to "beware the beast beneath the boards." A short time later, the dragon [[Meleys]] bursts out of the boards covering the stairs of the [[Dragonpit]] and almost kills Helaena, Aegon, Alicent, Aemond, and Otto.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Before the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|assassination]] of her son [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] at the hands of [[Blood]] and [[Cheese]], Helaena whispers to herself "They only want the boy," and tells [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] that she is afraid of "the rats."{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Helaena reveals to Aemond that she saw him burn Aegon at the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]]. She also tells him that Aegon will outlive him, sitting on a wooden throne (a wheelchair) after Aemond dies in the [[Gods Eye]].{{Ref|HOTD208}}

===Daenerys Targaryen===
[[Daenerys Targaryen]] dreamt that her dragon eggs would hatch if she carried them into a great fire.{{Ref|GOT206}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has frequent dragon dreams, at first predicting the hatching of [[Drogon]]: on two occasions she dreams of a black dragon who covers her in fire, making her feel reborn. She stops having dreams about this dragon once Drogon, [[Rhaegal]], and [[Viserion]] are hatched. She later has a dream of an [[White Walkers|army armored in ice]] that she melts with dragonflame. After she chains Rhaegal and Viserion, her dreams no longer seem to predict victories: she has a nightmare of [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] kissing her with blue and bruised lips, and having sex with her with a manhood as cold as ice.

Maester [[Aemon]] dreams of the [[red comet]], and tells [[Samwell Tarly]] that his brothers, Daeron, [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion]], and Aegon, all died as a result of their own dragon dreams. On his deathbed, Aemon disjointedly speaks of dreams and prophecies, though Sam is unable to make sense of any of it. He vaguely recalls "the prophecy" and his "brother's dream," possibly referring to Daeron Targaryen's dream of the dragons returning and [[Aerys Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Aerys I]] reading the same in a prophecy.

It is never mentioned that Viserys I or Helaena had dragon dreams. In 2020, [[George R.R. Martin]] discussed a fan theory that Aegon I conquered Westeros because of a dragon dream involving the Others, though he did not confirm whether it was true.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Phh5AS3uMY&t=152s</ref> However, [[Ryan Condal]] confirmed after the premiere of "[[The Heirs of the Dragon]]" that the inclusion of Aegon's prophecy in ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' was suggested by Martin himself.<ref>https://www.insider.com/house-of-the-dragon-asoiaf-prophecy-reveal-came-from-george-rr-martin-2022-8</ref>
