The '''Winter Wolves'''{{Ref|HOTDITE201}} are a force of 2,000 [[Northmen]] fighting for [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Lord [[Cregan Stark]] promises [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] 2,000 "greybeards who have already seen to many winters." Though they are old, Cregan assures Jace that they are well-honed and will fight hard.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Jace secures the allegiance of [[House Frey]], so that the Northern army can make use of the crossing at the [[Twins]] into the western [[Riverlands]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the agreement that included the pledge of 2,000 men to the [[Blacks]] was known as the Pact of Ice and Fire. The Winter Wolves were led by Lord Roderick Dustin, the Lord of [[Barrowton]].

The Winter Wolves were grizzled greybeards who wore old mail and ragged skins, wielded axes, mauls, spiked maces, and ancient iron swords, and rode shaggy northern [[horse]]s. These soldiers expected to die marching for glory, adventure, and plunder, as it was a long tradition in the North for old men to leave their homes in the winter to save supplies for their younger kin.
