[[File:House Targaryen banner.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The banner of House Targaryen, the royal house of [[Westeros]].]]
'''House Targaryen'''{{Ref|GOT101}}{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Targārio Lentrot''}} of [[Dragonstone]], known poetically as the '''House of the Dragon''',{{Ref|HOTD101}} is an exiled [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]] and the former royal house of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. House Targaryen [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered and unified]] the realm before it was deposed during [[Robert's Rebellion]], where [[House Baratheon]] replaced it as the new royal house. The two surviving Targaryens, [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], fled into [[exile]] to the [[Free Cities]] of [[Essos]] across the [[Narrow Sea]]. 

[[House Lannister]] replaced House Baratheon as the royal house in the aftermath of the [[War of the Five Kings]], but they were defeated in the [[Last War]]. After Daenerys [[Battle of King's Landing|burnt King's Landing]], she was [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassinated]] by her nephew [[Jon Snow]] to prevent further destruction. Jon is the last known Targaryen, but his identity as the son of [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] is kept a secret, and he was exiled to the [[Night's Watch]] for the assassination of Daenerys, effectively ending House Targaryen. However, the bloodline of House Targaryen still exists in various houses, such as House Baratheon, [[House Velaryon]], and [[House Martell]].

House Targaryen's [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a three-headed red dragon on a black background, and their [[house words]] are "Fire and Blood."<ref>"[[House Targaryen (short)|House Targaryen]]"</ref>{{Note|name=Words}} The head of House Targaryen is referred to as "the dragon."<ref name="Golden Crown">"[[A Golden Crown]]"</ref><ref>"[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]"</ref>

==History==
===Background===
House Targaryen was one of the forty [[dragonlord]] families of the [[Valyrian Freehold]], an empire that rose in [[Essos]] and dominated much of the [[known world]]. Due to their mastery of [[dragon]]s, and thus sorcery, they had no real opposition to contend with. Using dragonfire and magic, they built their grand capital city of [[Old Valyria|Valyria]], which was unmatched in quality in the east. 

The Valyrian Freehold's reign would continue until the [[Doom of Valyria]], a cataclysmic event that ultimately fractured the mighty empire and left the Targaryens as the last surviving dragonlords, due to [[Daenys Targaryen|Daenys the Dreamer]] having foreseen the disaster and convincing her father to leave their capital and take their family to Dragonstone, in spite of their rivals' sneers (another reason could be that Aenar met with some mishap at court and chose exile over execution).<ref>"[[Valyria's Last Scion: House Targaryen]]"</ref> [[Dragonstone]] would become the seat of their power, due to its importance in their survival, and [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] would end the [[Century of Blood]] after Valyria's fall by joining the [[Free Cities]]' side against [[Volantis]].<ref>"[[The Princess and the Queen]]"</ref> 

After a century of isolation, Aegon, disinterested in the eastern lands of his ancestors, which he saw as old and withered, looked west to the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]], which he sought to [[Aegon's Conquest|conquer]] and unify into [[Iron Throne|one realm]], with the aid of his dragons and his sister-wives [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]]. 

In the Targaryen era there were periods of peace and prosperity during the reign of benevolent kings like [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys the Conciliator]], but also periods of terror and distress when evil tyrants like [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] ruled. The civil population of Westeros suffered a lot especially during the bloody conflicts between opposing branches of House Targaryen, like the [[Dance of the Dragons]] and the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]s.

During the increasingly erratic reign of King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]], his son [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] was said to have [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapped]] [[Lyanna Stark]] for unknown reasons; this led to a [[Robert's Rebellion|massive uprising]] led by [[Eddard Stark]], [[Robert Baratheon]], and [[Jon Arryn]]. At the end of this war, Aerys and Rhaegar were dead and the Targaryen power-base in Westeros destroyed. Aerys's youngest children, [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], were taken by Targaryen loyalists into exile in the [[Free Cities]] of the East. Unknown to most, however, Rhaegar had his marriage with [[Elia Martell]] annulled and remarried Lyanna, with whom he also had a son, [[Jon Snow]]. As Lyanna lay dying after giving birth to her son, she pleaded with her brother Eddard to keep her baby safe from Robert, who surely would want her baby dead due to Robert's immense hatred for Rhaegar and promise to wipe out the Targaryen bloodline. She reveals her son's name is 'Aegon Targaryen'.<ref>"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref> To protect his sister's son from Robert, Eddard takes his infant nephew back with him to [[Winterfell]], names him 'Jon',<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/1202/ So Spake Martin, February 28, 2002]</ref> and claims him as his illegitimate son, raising Jon as his own child alongside his trueborn children.<ref name="Viewers Guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen entry]</ref> The child would become Jon Snow and grows up with the maternal side of his family. 

Generations of compound inbreeding have preserved in the Targaryen bloodline the classic Valyrian features of silver-white (platinum blonde) hair, and very fair, pale skin. Allegedly, this also preserved in their bloodline the ability to successfully bond with and ride dragons. They also seem to be somewhat more tolerant of extreme heat and high temperatures than other people, though they are by no means invulnerable to fire – or at least, not all of them. Unfortunately, some believe that this practice of inbreeding has also caused the trait of insanity to plague House Targaryen; though some members are known to be perfectly normal psychologically-speaking, other Targaryens throughout history have displayed bizarre, erratic and sometimes violent behavior, succumbing to the so-called '[[Targaryen madness]]'.

Daenerys later talks to Jorah after he helps her in taking control of the Dothraki where she commands him to cure himself of greyscale and return to her, which he has now done.

==Military strength==
===Essos===
House Targaryen's military strength has fluctuated over the last few years under Daenerys Targaryen's leadership. Since the death of her husband ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]], Daenerys has commanded a khalasar containing only a few dozen riders, less than half of whom are warriors, as well as a single trained [[Knighthood|knight]], [[Jorah Mormont]]. During her time in the Red Waste and Qarth, Daenerys's dragons were not large enough to provide combat assistance.

By the time Daenerys reached [[Astapor]] in [[Slaver's Bay]], her dragons had grown enough to provide limited air support in certain engagements, and she had gained the loyalty of an additional knight, Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. It should be pointed out that although limited, the dragons at this time are capable of providing the only air support in the known world.

Following the [[fall of Astapor]], Daenerys gained an army of 8,000 fully trained [[Unsullied]], elite warrior-eunuchs who fight in large, disciplined phalanx formations, as well as several hundred Unsullied-in-training who serve as auxiliaries.<ref>"[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"</ref>

Shortly after arriving at [[Yunkai]], Daenerys is able to secure the affection of [[Daario Naharis]], a lieutenant in the [[Second Sons]]. During a [[parley]] between Daenerys and the captains of the Second Sons, Daario points out that Daenerys's Unsullied are impressive infantry, but she still possesses no cavalry, siege weapons, or ships. Later that night, Daario slays the captains of the Second Sons, makes himself captain, and pledges the company to Daenerys. The Second Sons add 2,000 armored cavalry to the growing Targaryen army.<ref>"[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"</ref>

During Daenerys's rule of [[Meereen]], the Unsullied and the Second Sons take light, but constant losses, most of them [[Shadow war|assassinated]] by the [[Sons of the Harpy]]. The greatest losses of this time were both of her knights: Daenerys banished Ser Jorah upon learning that he had once spied on her for [[Robert Baratheon]], and Ser Barristan was killed by the Sons of the Harpy. During her time in Meereen, her forces took control of the Meereenese Navy that consisted of 93 ships, although the fleet was later destroyed in the harbor.

After burning the Dothraki khals in [[Vaes Dothrak]], Daenerys emerges unburnt from the flames, and all the people in the city bow down to her. In perhaps her greatest turnaround yet, Daenerys secured the loyalty of the roughly 100,000 Dothraki assembled at the time,<ref>"[[Book of the Stranger]]"</ref> finally gaining the numbers – though not the means – to retake Westeros.

By this point, all three dragons had grown significantly larger, with Drogon, in particular, becoming larger than a carriage due to his continued freedom. He is now large enough for Daenerys to sit comfortably across his back, and has begun to obey her commands while riding. Should they be tamed and ridden, all three dragons are now large enough to coordinate aerial assaults should the need arise. During the [[second siege of Meereen]], all three dragons were deployed to devastating effect, even though Drogon was the only one being ridden.

Upon breaking the Second Siege, Daenerys took possession of the remains of their armada, roughly 200 ships. Shortly after, she was visited by [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]], who offered their ships – the better part of the formidable [[Iron Fleet]] – to her in exchange for supporting Yara's claim to the Salt Throne, to which Daenerys agreed, on the condition that the ironborn change their ways forever.

===Westeros===
There are no official allies or vassals of House Targaryen left in Westeros. In truth, [[Varys]] is a Targaryen loyalist and possesses a vast spy network, but by himself, Varys commands no military forces and cannot be considered a military asset. He eventually relocated to Meereen and began openly serving Daenerys, again mostly through coordinating his spy network.

King Robert Baratheon expressed fear that even after all these years, there are still a sizable number of noble Houses in Westeros who are either secret Targaryen loyalists or who later developed some grievance with Robert's rule, and would flock to the Targaryen banner if they attempted to retake the Iron Throne in open war. It is not clear what influence his opinions since Ser Jorah stressed to Dany that the number of Targaryen loyalists remaining in Westeros is far lower than Viserys liked to believe. Viserys believed that because House Tyrell of the Reach and House Martell of Dorne fought on the Targaryen side during Robert's Rebellion, the prospects were good that they'd be willing to join his cause and rebel against Robert. Nonetheless, for much of Robert's reign, and most of the [[War of the Five Kings]] that followed, it is unknown that dissatisfied Houses would support a Targaryen return, while House Tyrell had become closely aligned with the Lannister-backed House Baratheon.

However, following the [[Assassination of Balon Greyjoy]], the [[Coup in Dorne]] and the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]], the attitudes of several major factions changed dramatically. Fleeing their uncle upon his success at the [[kingsmoot on Old Wyk]], Yara and Theon Greyjoy made for Meereen, where they agreed to support Daenerys's claim and provide transport for Daenerys's army, as well as support at sea, in exchange for Yara's accession to the Salt Throne, independent of the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys accepted the independence of the Iron Islands, provided that the independent Ironborn give up all reaving, raping and pillaging, to which Yara reluctantly acquiesced. Meanwhile, Ellaria, in desperate need of allies, agreed to support Daenerys's invasion. At Varys's urging, she also reached out to [[Olenna Tyrell]], who was out for revenge against [[Cersei Lannister]].

As a result, House Targaryen gained the support of the largely intact forces of the [[Reach]], [[Dorne]], and the [[Iron Islands]]. After the recent events of her invasion of Westeros, Daenerys's army had already taken several heavy blows. Yara's Ironborn fleet was destroyed by her uncle, [[Euron Greyjoy]]. The Sand Snakes, along with Yara, were captured by Euron, effectively knocking Dorne out of the war. Jaime Lannister then led an army into the Reach to [[Sack of Highgarden|sack Highgarden]], also knocking House Tyrell out of the war. The Unsullied took moderate casualties at the [[Fall of Casterly Rock]], which was likewise the case with the Dothraki at the [[Battle of the Goldroad]]. When [[Jon Snow]], King in the North, sought an alliance with Daenerys for her help in defeating the [[Wight|Army of the Dead]] threatening all of humanity, he initially refused her condition that he bend the knee as he did not know her yet. However, when Daenerys came to rescue Jon's party [[Beyond the Wall]] and the [[Night King]] managed to kill [[Viserion]] with an ice spear, upon which Daenerys vowed to fight the Night King at Jon's side, Jon bent the knee to Daenerys as queen and agreed to pledge his Northern forces to her. The Night King reanimated Viserion as a [[wight]], leaving Drogon and Rhaegal as Daenerys's living dragons.

Half of the Dothraki and Unsullied troops were killed during the Great War. The remainder were forced to scatter and retreat behind the walls of Winterfell. Although both Drogon and Rhaegal survived, they were injured during the battle against the dead. After the Great War, Targaryen forces still maintained roughly a dozen ships in the royal fleet and a contingent of Unsullied forces. After Euron shot down and killed Rhaegal with scorpion bolts, Drogon became Daenerys’s only living dragon.

Daenerys had Varys burned alive by Drogon for treason shortly before the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. The Targaryen-Northern forces suffered light casualties in the battle, but they emerged victorious when the city surrendered to Daenerys, allowing her to take the Iron Throne. However, Daenerys laid waste to a surrendered King's Landing, killing thousands of civilians in the process. She declared to her assembled Dothraki and Unsullied forces that they "liberated" the people of King's Landing and will do so all over the world. Daenerys had Tyrion Lannister arrested for treason upon finding out Tyrion tried to save his brother Jaime. Jon pleaded with Daenerys to stop this path of destruction but Daenerys believed her actions were necessary to build her ideal world. Unable to dissuade her, an agonized Jon [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassinated]] her to prevent more carnage upon the world. Drogon was anguished to discover his mother’s lifeless body, but he did not blame Jon for her death. Instead, he used his fiery breath to melt the Iron Throne before carrying Daenerys across the Narrow Sea.

After Daenerys’s death, Grey Worm and the Unsullied sailed to [[Naath]] to protect its people as Grey Worm had promised Missandei. Meanwhile, the Dothraki either returned to Essos or integrated themselves into Westerosi society.

==Family tree==
{{Targaryen tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Targaryen family (they were not a formal House, as this was a Westerosi concept not found in the Freehold) moved from Valyria to Dragonstone, then the most far-flung outpost of the Valyrian Freehold, apparently in fear of a prophecy predicting the destruction of Valyria a century before it happened. Both before and after their relocation, the Targaryens were counted among the dragonlords, the forty or so powerful families who bred, raised and rode their own dragons and thus dominated Valyrian politics and culture. They were, however, never among the most powerful of those families. After the fall of Valyria, the Targaryens stayed on Dragonstone for a hundred years, apparently hoarding the strength of their dragons and debating whether to invade Westeros or to attempt to seize control of the Valyrian colony-states which later became known as the Free Cities. When the time came, the Targaryens ultimately assisted the Free Cities in asserting their continued independence and then proceeded to invade Westeros.

House Targaryen ruled Westeros for 283 years, during which time they survived substantial civil wars (including the Dance of Dragons and no fewer than five Blackfyre Rebellions), plague (the Great Spring Sickness), and an attempted foreign invasion (in the War of the Ninepenny Kings). They were brought down when the Mad King's insanity became too dangerous to be ignored.

The Targaryens adopted the religion and many of the customs of Westeros, but they clung to two old Valyrian customs in defiance of public disapproval: Targaryen princes and kings were allowed to have multiple wives, and Targaryens were allowed to marry brother to sister, something considered taboo elsewhere in Westeros. The former custom was apparently considered outdated in Valyria itself, but the latter was fairly common.

The generations of Targaryen inbreeding produced a distinctive set of physical features shared by all of their members during the House's three centuries of rule. This includes a generally pale appearance with silver-white (platinum blonde) hair and purple irises. While pale, they are not albinos, although their eyebrows are white. The actors playing Daenerys and Viserys are actually both dark-haired, so they had to wear wigs, although the production team decided not to dye their eyebrows to match. The TV series opted not to portray the Targaryens with purple eyes, partially due to the logistical difficulty of matching purple contact lenses for actors in every shot. The TV series originally filmed Viserys and Daenerys wearing violet contact lenses, but show creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss quickly abandoned their use. As they explained in the Season 1 Blu-ray episode commentaries, "actors act with their eyes, and [the lenses] really hurt the emotion."<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays Den of Geek]</ref>

By the point the novels reached, there are two living descendants of the house: Daenerys and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia who is revealed to be alive in ''A Dance with Dragons''. Since Jon Snow's parantage has yet to be confirmed in the books, Aegon has the strongest claim to the Iron Throne, ahead of Daenerys, although his legitimacy is questioned by Tommen's small council. A popular fan theory states that Aegon is really the son of Illyrio Mopatis and his late wife Serra, a possible member of House Blackfyre.

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Targaryen" is pronounced "Tar-GAIR-ee-in".
