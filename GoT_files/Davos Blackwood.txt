'''Davos Blackwood''' is a member of [[House Blackwood]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Davos, along with other members of his house, confront Ser [[Aeron Bracken]], accusing the latter of moving the boundary stones separating the [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]]-[[House Bracken|Bracken]] border near the [[Burning Mill]]. The fight between the two eventually escalates into a full-scale battle, thus kicking off the events of the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]]; with the Blackwoods supporting [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s claim to the [[Iron Throne]] and the Brackens in support of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}
