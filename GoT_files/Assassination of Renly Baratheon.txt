{{Dialogue a-b|Brienne of Tarth|I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face. You murdered him with blood magic?|Stannis Baratheon|I did.|[[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]]|Mother's Mercy}}
The '''assassination of Renly Baratheon''' was an event during the [[War of the Five Kings]]. It was the direct result of the failed parley between claimants to the [[Iron Throne]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]].

==History==
===Background===
Following [[assassination of Robert Baratheon|Robert's death]], his brothers Stannis and Renly claim the Iron Throne for themselves. They both know Robert's official heir [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is not actually Robert's son, but a [[bastard]] born of incest between [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]].

Stannis, from his seat on the island of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], claims the throne as Robert's legitimate heir by right of birth, with the sole support of the lords of the Narrow Sea, houses sworn to Dragonstone. Renly, from the ancestral seat of [[House Baratheon]], [[Storm's End]], also declares himself [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]] with the support of [[House Tyrell]], as well as the Stormlords, vassals to House Baratheon.<ref>"[[The North Remembers]]"</ref>

===The parley===
Knowing his numbers were vastly inferior, Stannis sets sail to Storm's End to demand the allegiance of his younger brother and the Stormlords. Renly, however, refuses to [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]], citing the vastly superior numbers of his army and the fact that no lord wants Stannis as King.

[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], who had been sent by [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to discuss an alliance between Houses [[House Stark|Stark]] and Baratheon against [[House Lannister]], attempts to make peace between the brothers and reminds them of their common foe, but is unheeded by both would-be kings. Stannis coldly reminds Catelyn that [[Eddard Stark|her husband]] supported his claim to the throne, even at the cost of his own life.

Stannis offers to make Renly his heir and reinstate him as Master of Laws in the [[Small Council]]. Stannis gives him until the night to consider his decision, adding that if Renly does not come to him by sunrise, he will be destroyed.<ref name=":0">"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref>

===Smuggling the Red Woman===
Stannis orders [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] to smuggle [[Melisandre]] to a seaside cove nearby Renly's camp. Despite his misgivings, Davos does as ordered and smuggles Melisandre aboard a small rowboat.

The pair finds the cove to be barred by a metal gate. However, Melisandre is not cowed by the obstacle and merely removes her robe to reveal her pregnant belly to a horrified Davos. She quickly gives birth to a shadowy, human-like immaterial creature with an appearance similar to that of Stannis, that vanishes soon after leaving Melisandre's womb.<ref name=":0" />

===Renly's death===
That same night, as Renly's men prepared for the inevitable battle, he holds another meeting with Catelyn to discuss the terms of his alliance with Robb inside his tent. Renly offers to accept Robb styling himself King in the North, ruling over all lands north of the [[Neck]], as long as he swears loyalty to him. Catelyn tries again to convince Renly of making peace with Stannis, only for Renly to retort that treating with Stannis will be like treating with the wind.

After Renly removes his crown and breastplate before a mirror and gives them to [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], the [[shadow]] born from Melisandre materialized behind Renly, quickly stabs him through the back with one of its talons. Renly falls, dead, and the shadow vanishes before the eyes of the horrified Brienne and Catelyn.

Hearing Brienne's scream, two of Renly's Kingsguard, [[Emmon Cuy]] and [[Robar Royce]], enter the tent. Believing Brienne to be the culprit, they attack her, but she kills her two sworn brothers.<ref name=":1">"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"</ref>

===Aftermath===
The Stormlords largely swears fealty to Stannis when he arrives the following day. House Tyrell, however, leads the forces of the [[Reach]] back to [[Highgarden]], and later forms an alliance with House Lannister. A few noble houses of the Reach, such as the [[House Florent|Florents]] and [[House Fossoway|Fossoways]], however, bend the knee to Stannis. Brienne is blamed for the murder by many and flees the camp with Catelyn, who accepts Brienne's oath of service.

While [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] grieves over Renly's death, [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] states that Brienne murdered him. Loras disagrees, correctly pointing out that someone else gained the most from Renly's death, and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] says "Stannis".<ref name=":1" />

On several occasions, Brienne is accused of Renly's murder, which she firmly denies.<ref>"[[The Lion and the Rose]]"</ref><ref>"[[The House of Black and White]]"</ref>

Although Renly's murder initially benefits Stannis, who has obtained the strength of the Stormlords and a handful of the Reach lords, it backfires on him during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], as the forces commanded by [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] are bolstered by the Tyrells, led by "[[Loras Tyrell|Renly's ghost]]", and turn the tide against Stannis.<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

After his defeat, Stannis expresses some regret for the death of his younger brother, as he is now a [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]] with nothing to show for it.<ref>"[[Valar Morghulis]]"</ref>

Renly's murder also ultimately results in Stannis's doom, as Brienne eventually avenges Renly by tracking Stannis down after [[Battle in the ice|his failed attack on Winterfell]]. Once she finds Stannis in the forest, wounded and exhausted from the battle, she confronts him with Renly's murder, which Stannis admits to. Thus, she sentences Stannis to death in Renly's name, and even by addressing Renly as '''Renly of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm'''.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
In a deleted scene from Season 2, some time after Renly's death, Loras is looking over his armor (which he presumably took from Renly's body) while talking to Margaery; he asks her if she has any idea how hard it is to drive a sword through two steel plates. It is unclear whether Renly was still wearing another piece of armor under his clothes when the shadow killed him, or this scene is a relic from an earlier draft of the script, which more closely matches Renly's death in the books.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are two separate assassinations and two shadows carrying them out.

The first one is born in an unknown location; Davos does not witness its creation. It reaches Renly's tent in a similar way, though it slits Renly's throat - while he wears him armor - beneath his metal gorget instead of stabbing him. Also, Brienne apparently kills one of the two guards who enter the tent with Ser [[Robar Royce]] and Ser [[Emmon Cuy]], but doesn't kill any of Renly's Rainbow Guard, since Catelyn convinces Ser Robar of Brienne's innocence, and then uses iron brazier to knock Ser Emmon unconscious. Nevertheless, both Emmon and Robar are killed by Loras in a fit of rage, with Loras also believing Brienne to be the culprit. Neither Margaery nor Littlefinger are present at Renly's camp during the events; Margaery is at Bitterbridge with the full strength of House Tyrell, while Littlefinger is still at [[King's Landing]].

Another notable change is that in the books Stannis never admits he had anything to do with Renly's death, though it is doubtful Melisandre would have sent the shadow to kill Renly without direct order from Stannis.

When Davos asks Stannis about Renly's death, Stannis answers ambiguously: "''I dream of it sometimes. Of Renly's dying. A green tent, candles, a woman screaming. And blood. I was still abed when he died. Your Devan will tell you. He tried to wake me... Devan says I thrashed and cried out, but what does it matter? It was a dream. I was in my tent when Renly died, and when I woke my hands were clean''."{{Bookref|ACOK|42}} Stannis's words can be interpreted as a statement that a guilty person may say in attempt to convince himself that his hands are clean, but it is uncertain.

In the third novel, after Davos is released from jail, he tells Stannis that he sought to kill Melisandre because she murdered [[Cressen]], Ser Cortnay Penrose (see below), and Renly. Stannis answers "''She saw Renly's end in the flames, yes, but she had no more part in it than I did''."{{Bookref|ASOS|36}} Again, those words can be interpreted either way.

Following Renly's death, [[Varys]] reports to the [[Small Council]] that there are many rumors about the identity of the murderer: a groom said that Renly was slain by a knight of his own Rainbow Guard; a washerwoman claimed Stannis stole through the heart of his brother's army with [[Lightbringer|his magic sword]]; several men-at-arms believed a woman did the fell deed, but could not agree on which woman: either a maid that Renly had spurned or a [[Prostitution|camp follower]] or Catelyn. Although Varys does not specifically mention Brienne's name, she is commonly rumored to be the murderer.

At the beginning of the journey to King's Landing, Jaime tells Brienne "We're both kingslayers here, if what I've heard is true". Brienne denies killing Renly, and tells about the shadow. Jaime laughs and says that he should have thought of such tale when he was found standing over [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]]'s body. He nastily teases Brienne "did the Starks pay you to slit his throat, or was it Stannis? Had Renly spurned you, was that the way of it? Or perhaps your moon's blood was on you". Brienne is greatly offended, but controls her temper.

When Jaime and Brienne enter King's Landing, Loras confronts Brienne, accusing her of Renly's death and challenging her. Brienne tries to explain what really happened, but Loras does not believe. Jaime intervenes, commands Loras to sheathe his sword, and claims that Brienne is not a liar. Later, Jaime makes Loras understand that Brienne is innocent, based on two facts: First, Renly's armor was made of the finest steel, and no human being - not even someone as strong as [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] - could have sliced through it ''cleanly''; second, if Brienne intended to kill Renly, why armor him first? Loras admits that perhaps Brienne speaks the truth after all.{{Bookref|ASOS|72}}

Before Brienne leaves the capital to search for [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], she asks Jaime whether he truly meant what he had told Loras during the near-bloody confrontation - that her story about the shadow was true. Jaime shrugs and answers "I would have killed Renly myself if we'd met in battle, what do I care who cut his throat?". 

Throughout the fourth novel, Brienne encounters people, among them Ser Hyle Hunt and [[Randyll Tarly]], who accuse her of Renly's death. Brienne keeps denying that, but no one really cares about Renly's death. Randyll, who has always treated Brienne hostilely, seems to take her word that she did not kill Renly, but comments offensively "you only let him die"."{{Bookref|AFFC|14}}

The second assassination is carried out by a second shadow born after Davos smuggles Melisandre beneath the walls of Storm's End, and is sent after Ser Cortnay Penrose, the castellan of Storm's End, who refused to yield the castle to Stannis even after Renly's death."{{Bookref|ACOK|42}} The circumstances of this assassination were transferred to Renly's death in the TV series adaptation. The second assassination takes place off-screen, and is revealed when Varys reports [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that it was said Ser Penrose threw himself from a tower. Neither Varys nor Tyrion believe that, figuring Stannis was responsible. Varys points out the strange connection between the two murders of Renly and Ser Penrose, and speculates (correctly) it was witchcraft. Tyrion is skeptical, believing (incorrectly) that Stannis has hired a skilled assassin from the [[Free Cities]].{{Bookref|ACOK|42}}

Similarly to Renly's death, Ser Cortnay's death initially seems to benefit Stannis, but eventually backfires at him at the battle: the delay at Storm's End for one day, against Davos's advice to leave for King's Landing immediately, enables Tywin and the Tyrells' reinforcements arrive at the critical moment, just when Stannis's troops start invading the city.

Renly's death has been prophesied by an old [[woods witch]] known as the Ghost of High Heart: "''I dreamt I saw a [[shadow]] with [[Lord of Light|a burning heart]] butchering a golden [[House Baratheon|stag]]''."{{Bookref|ASOS|22}}
