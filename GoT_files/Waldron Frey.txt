==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
When [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] negotiates with [[Walder Frey]] to gain permission for [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and his army to pass the [[Twins]], Walder demands that [[Arya Stark|Arya]] will marry his son Waldron. Catelyn and Robb accept his terms.{{Ref|GOT109}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Arya is betrothed to Elmar Frey. The character has been renamed for the television series. Elmar is the twenty-second son of Lord Walder Frey and the fourth born to Lord Walder's seventh wife, Annara Farring. Elmar is the older brother of [[Shirei Frey]], the youngest child that Lord Walder had with Annara Farring. He is nine years old.

Elmar encounters Arya several times in [[Harrenhal]] and tries to boss her around, while mentioning proudly that he is trueborn son of lord Frey and is going to marry a princess - both of them are unaware that Arya is that princess. Arya is unimpressed and does not comply to him. After being informed that Robb breached the pact with the Freys, Elmar tells Arya whiningly that his father told him he had to marry someone else, or to become a [[septon]]. Arya has no sympathy to him.

Elmar appears briefly in the third novel, serving as the [[cupbearer]] when [[Roose Bolton]] hosts [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] at Harrenhal. Roose tells them that Elmar was to wed Arya Stark, but Lord Frey had no choice but to break the betrothal when Robb betrayed him.

Elmar does not appear in the novels afterwards.

In the German dub of the TV series the name Elmar was used instead of Waldron.
