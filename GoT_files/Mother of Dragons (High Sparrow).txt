The '''Mother of Dragons''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] at a [[Pleasure house|brothel]] on the [[Long Bridge]] of [[Volantis]].

==Biography==
===Background===
She is a [[Slavery|slave]] forced into [[Prostitution|prostitution]] at a [[Pleasure house|brothel]] on the [[Long Bridge]] of [[Volantis]]. Like all bedslaves in Volantis, she was branded with a slave tattoo shaped like a tear on her cheek. As word of Daenerys Targaryen's exploits spread, the prostitute started dressing like her to entice customers.{{Ref|GOT503}} Exposed buttocks aside, the costume is actually rather accurate, being the exact shade of blue and almost the same style that Daenerys favored during the [[Liberation of Slaver's Bay]].{{Ref|GOT301}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Varys]] encounter her in a brothel in [[Volantis]] and deduce that her she has taken inspiration from [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in crafting her appearance when a couple of patrons refer to her as "the Mother of Dragons". As she flirts with the customers, [[Jorah Mormont]] looks upon her and is painfully reminded of Daenerys, who has exiled him for spying for her enemies. [[Clea]] informs Tyrion that she is very popular, as all who enter the brothel want to fuck a queen.{{Ref|GOT503}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[Samantha McEwan|Samantha Bentley]] played two other prostitutes in Season 4 and Season 5, but they are not the same characters. Indeed, within a single episode ("High Sparrow") she played both a whore dressed up as the [[Stranger]] in [[King's Landing]], and hundreds of miles away, a whore dressed up as Daenerys Targaryen in [[Volantis]] - her face was obscured by her hair when she played the Stranger, so it was easy to have her appear twice without anyone noticing.

Costume designer [[Michele Clapton]] explained how the idea to have a prostitute in a Volantis brothel cosplaying as Daenerys, wearing an assless-cutout imitation of Daenerys's costume: she came up with the design as a joke, a good laugh was had by all, and then they decided it was so funny that they should put the joke costume into the actual TV show. As Clapton said:

:"I wanted to shock [showrunners] David [Benioff] and Dan [Weiss], because they always ask me to do outrageous things. I just thought, 'Fine, I'm going to do a costume with no ass! And they were like, 'What were you thinking, Clapton?'" - but ultimately the costume made it into the show, and - "The whole essence of Dany is there...[there] are always circles cut in and bits missing in her dress, so I thought it would be really funny. Some people said, 'Well, how would they know what she looked like?' - She's this iconic woman so of course people talk and gossip and know what people look like! It was meant to be amusing."<ref>[http://fashionista.com/2015/06/game-of-thrones-season-5-costume-designer-interview Michele Clapton ''Fashionista'' interview], June 2015.</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tyrion is captured by Jorah at a brothel in [[Selhorys]] instead of Volantis. When they encounter each other, Jorah has hired a beautiful prostitute with silver hair, implying that she has Valyrian ancestry and resembles Daenerys.
