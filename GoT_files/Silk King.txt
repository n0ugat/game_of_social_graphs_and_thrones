The '''Silk King''' is a member of the [[Thirteen]]. He is killed by [[Pyat Pree]] when [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] proclaims himself [[King of Qarth]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
He receives [[Daenerys Targaryen]] outside the gates of the city with the rest of the [[Thirteen]]. They refuse to admit her without seeing her [[dragon]]s. She is defiant and is eventually admitted under the protection of [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]].{{Ref|GOT204}}

He's present at a gathering of Qartheen dignitaries attended by Daenerys, accompanied by her protectors, and Xaro Xhoan Daxos.{{Ref|GOT205}} He, along with the [[Spice King]] and the [[Copper King]], turns Dany down when she requests boats. The Silk King will not help her because of his business with [[House Lannister]], as he doesn't want to offend his best customers.{{Ref|GOT206}}

He's present at a session of the Thirteen in which Daenerys accuses the Spice King of stealing her dragons. He's murdered by one of the doubles of [[Pyat Pree]] along with the rest of the Qartheen merchant lords after the [[Warlocks|warlock]] reveals he stole the dragons and declares Xaro Xhoan Daxos King of Qarth.{{Ref|GOT207}}
