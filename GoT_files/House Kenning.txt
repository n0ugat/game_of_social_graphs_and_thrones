In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Kenning of Harlaw is a noble house who were once bitter foes of House Harlaw, but were defeated and are now their vassals. Their sigil is the [[Storm God]]'s cloudy hand, pale grey, yellow lightning flashing from the fingertips, on black.

There's also a House Kenning in the [[Westerlands]], seated at the castle of Kayce, located in a peninsula south of [[Fair Isle]] and northwest of [[Casterly Rock]]. House Kenning of Kayce is a [[cadet branch]] born in the days the [[ironborn]] held much of the Western coast of [[Westeros]], from [[Bear Island]] to the [[Arbor]]. It was founded by Herrock Kenning who's warhorn (called the Horn of Herrock) has been passed down by his descendants. Eventually the Lannisters drove the ironborn completely out of the mainland (of the Westerlands), while House Kenning of Kayce stayed and accepted Lannister rule.

In real life, a "[[Wikipedia:Kenning|kenning]]" is a type of figurative device used in Old Norse poetry.
