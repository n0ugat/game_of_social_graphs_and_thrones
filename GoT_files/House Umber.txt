'''House Umber'''{{Guideref|Viewer's Guide}} of [[Last Hearth]] is an extinct<ref name="E69">"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"</ref> vassal house that held fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. Their lands were in the far north of the Stark territories, just south of the [[Wall]] and the lands held by the [[Night's Watch]]. Following the [[fall of Last Hearth]], an early event of the [[Great War]], House Umber is extinct in the male line. It is unknown whether any female members of the house survived the conflict.

House Umber's sigil is four chains linked by a central ring on a dark red field. Their motto is not known at present.

== History ==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
House Umber rallies behind [[House Stark]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]], with [[Greatjon Umber]] being the first to suggest crowning [[Robb Stark]] [[King in the North]] and knelt before him.<ref>"[[Fire and Blood]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Bran Stark]] sends his brother [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], [[Osha]], and [[Shaggydog]] to seek shelter at the [[Last Hearth]] because the Umbers are loyal bannermen of the Starks.<ref>"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Although refusing to pledge fealty to [[House Bolton]], [[Smalljon Umber]] asks [[Ramsay Bolton]] to join forces with him to fight the [[Free Folk]] that have been let into the realm by [[Jon Snow]], who pose a threat to the Umbers given Last Hearth's proximity to the [[Wall]]. To seal their alliance, Smalljon hands over Rickon and Osha as captives he had betrayed to Ramsay and presents the head of Shaggydog as proof of his master's identity. Smalljon also claims that his father Greatjon is dead.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref>

When news of Smalljon's betrayal reaches Jon and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at [[Castle Black]], the latter declares that the Umbers "can hang."<ref>"[[The Door]]"</ref>

[[Melessa Tarly]] tells [[Gilly]] that she and [[Randyll Tarly]] met a Lord Umber (presumably the Greatjon) who taught his daughters how to hunt.<ref>"[[Blood of My Blood]]"</ref>

Smalljon is killed by [[Tormund]] during the [[Battle of the Bastards]].<ref>"[[Battle of the Bastards]]"</ref>

=== [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]] ===
[[Ned Umber]], Smalljon's young son, became the Lord of Last Hearth after the Smalljon's death during the [[Battle of the Bastards]]. Ned is present during a meeting of the Northern Lords at [[Winterfell]] where his father's actions are discussed and what the consequences should be. Lord [[Yohn Royce]] and Lady Sansa Stark voice their opinions that the Umbers and the similarly treacherous [[House Karstark]] should be punished, tearing down their castles or gifting them to more loyal families, but King Jon Snow refuses to punish the new generations for their fathers' crimes. Ned is called forwards alongside [[Alys Karstark]] and reaffirms his house's loyalty to House Stark, allowing him to keep his title and home.<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

=== [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]] ===
Ned Umber and his household are slaughtered by the [[Night King]], the [[White Walkers]], and the [[Wight|army of the dead]] at Last Hearth. Ned's body is left behind in Last Hearth as a message, while those who were slaughtered were nowhere to be found, likely having been reanimated as wights.<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

[[Beric Dondarrion]] deduces the deaths of all members of House Umber. Though nearly impossible to confirm this, Tormund states that anyone who is currently north of Winterfell is most likely dead, supporting Beric's assumption.<ref name="E69"/>

== Past members ==
* Lord {[[Greatjon Umber]]}, former head of House Umber. Died during the [[War of the Five Kings]].
** Lord {[[Smalljon Umber]]}, his son and successor. Killed by [[Tormund]] during the [[Battle of the Bastards]].
*** Lord {[[Ned Umber]]}, his son and successor. Becomes the Lord of Last Hearth after his father's death. Killed by the [[Night King]] during the [[Fall of Last Hearth]] and reanimated as a [[wight]]. Destroyed by [[Beric Dondarrion]].
** {Unidentified daughters}. Likely perished during or shortly after the Fall of Last Hearth.

{{Umber tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Umbers are staunch supporters of the Starks, but truly respect strength alone, and were once petty kings. The Umbers are strong, formidable warriors who enjoy life to the full, although some of the family members are less reputable, with some Umber lords said to still practice the banned tradition of First Night. Their lands are close to the Wall and they are bitterly opposed to the [[Free Folk|wildlings]], as sometimes small wildling bands who evade the Watch raid their lands.

The Umbers are the northernmost noble House in Westeros, and may be named after the real English county of Northumberland or the medieval Anglian kingdom of Northumbria.

House Umber's [[heraldry]] in the books is different to the TV show. In the books, the sigil is a roaring giant in chains, but in the TV show it is just the chains. Coincidentally, this makes House Umber's sigil in the TV series greatly resemble that of [http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Roxton House Roxton] in the novels: Four golden chains linked by a central ring on sky blue. There isn't much chance of overlap in the TV narrative, however: the Umbers appear very prominently in both the books and novels, while House Roxton (a family from the Reach) hasn't been established in the TV show at all, and has barely even been mentioned in the main novels. The only appearance that House Roxton actually made was in a listing of heraldry designs released by Martin (though characters from House Roxton appear in some of the prequel novellas).

When Greatjon joined Robb's army, he took most of the Umber troops, leaving behind the green boys and the old. Following the Red Wedding, in which the Greatjon is taken captive and the Smalljon (who has always been loyal to the Starks) is killed, Mors Umber and the green boys join Stannis in [[Battle in the ice|his campaign against the Boltons]], while Hother Umber and the greybeards reluctantly join the Boltons because Greatjon is held captive by the Freys. Hother is by no means loyal to the Boltons and the Lannisters, on the contrary: he is anxious to settle the score with those who are responsible for his great-nephew's death, and restrains himself only because he fears for his nephew's life.

===Known members===
* Lord [[Greatjon Umber]], the current head of the family. Grandson of Hoarfrost Umber, by Hoarfrost's eldest son. Taken captive by the Freys in the [[Red Wedding]].

* Hother "Whoresbane" Umber, the Greatjon's uncle, youngest son of Hoarfrost Umber. He swears fealty to the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] out of fear for his nephew's life.
