{{Quote|Vhagar was five times the size of Arrax and a hardened survivor of a hundred battles. Vhagar caught him above Shipbreaker Bay. Watchers on the castle walls saw distant blasts of flame and heard a shriek drown out the thunder. Prince Lucerys fell, broken, to be swallowed by the waves.|[[Robert Baratheon]]|The Dance of Dragons}}
'''Arrax'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Arraks''}}{{Note|<small>ÄR</small>-aks}} was a [[dragon]] bred by [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]]. He was the mount of [[Lucerys Velaryon]]. He was the first dragon to die in the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Arrax hatched in [[118 AC]], the same year as the birth of his master, Lucerys Velaryon.{{Dateref|Arrax}} He has white scales, purple wing membranes, orange eyes, and orange frills.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:TBQ Arrax & Lucerys 3.png|right|thumb|Flying to Storm's End.]]Arrax is flown by Lucerys to [[Storm's End]] in order to send a message to Lord [[Borros Baratheon]] regarding House Baratheon's loyalty to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s cause. Landing in the courtyard of the castle and dismounted by Lucerys, both are startled by the presence of [[Vhagar]], indicating that [[Aemond Targaryen]] is also at Storm's End. Later, as a storm begins to rage over the castle, Arrax grows wary but is calmed by his rider. They take off and attempt to fly back to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] but struggle to navigate through the savage rain and high winds.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

The two are then met by Aemond riding atop Vhagar, who seeks retribution for his lost eye and [[Fight above Shipbreaker Bay|chases]] them over [[Shipbreaker Bay]]. As Aemond repeatedly menaces Lucerys, Arrax flies down into a canyon along the coast, forcing Vhagar to fly up and abandon the pursuit. However, Arrax suddenly ambushes Vhagar and blasts the ancient dragon with his flame. Lucerys regains control and commands him to fly over the storm clouds. Seemingly safe in the clear skies, an enraged Vhagar attacks them from the side, biting Arrax to pieces and eating Lucerys whole.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:S1 Dragon Sizes Concept Art.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Concept art comparing dragon sizes features an infant Arrax as he would have appeared in "The Princess and the Queen."]]
Arrax was originally written to appear in "[[The Princess and the Queen]]." The scene in which he was supposed to appear instead featured [[Vermax]].<ref name="archiveofourown">https://archiveofourown.org/works/41199249/chapters/105375081#workskin</ref>

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] and her children spread an accusation that the three sons of her stepdaughter [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] were not the sons of Rhaenyra's husband [[Laenor Velaryon]], but [[bastard]]s fathered by Ser [[Harwin Strong]]. To show that he considered Rhaenyra and her sons to be the true heirs to the [[Iron Throne]], King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] had a [[dragon]] egg placed in the cradle of each boy during their infancy. People who doubted the boys' paternity did not expect the eggs to ever hatch and were disappointed when each of the eggs hatched, with Arrax being the counterpart of Lucerys Velaryon, Rhaenyra's second son.

Arrax's color isn't stated in text, but the artist commissioned for the 2021 ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' Calendar, [https://www.artstation.com/samhogg Sam Hogg], asked for clarification from [[George R.R. Martin]]'s team and was told that Arrax's coloration was "pearlescent white with yellow flame, golden eyes and a golden chest."<ref>[https://twitter.com/Zephyri/status/1350476186141544453 Sam Hogg, Arrax Color]</ref>
