{{Dialogue a-b|Slaver|It will be a dwarf-sized cock!|Tyrion|Guess again!|The slaver to [[Tyrion Lannister]]|Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken}}
A '''slaver''' is one of the slavers accompanying [[Malko]].

==Biography==
===Background===
He is one of the slavers accompanying [[Malko]].{{Ref|GOT506}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
When [[Tyrion Lannister]] and his captor, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], are captured by [[Malko]] and his slavers, he orders his men to cut Tyrion's throat and remove his penis, as they believe that a [[dwarf]]'s penis contains magical powers. When Tyrion pleads for the slavers not to cut off his penis, he says that when they find a cock merchant, he needs to see Tyrion for himself or else he cannot believe the penis to actually be his. The slaver claims Tyrion's penis to be the size of a dwarf, but Tyrion debunks this, as a dwarf's penis looks identical to that of any other normal adult man.{{Ref|GOT506}}
