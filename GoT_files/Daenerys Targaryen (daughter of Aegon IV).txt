{{Quote|Eventually, after centuries of courtship, House Martell got into bed with the Targaryens. We took King Daeron II and his sister for our own, before they could take each other, and six kingdoms became seven. Even now, I do not blame my ancestors. One look at those long, silver locks. It is not every day a man gets to ride a dragon.|[[Oberyn Martell]]|House Martell (short)}}
Princess '''Daenerys Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Daenerys Targārien''}} was a princess of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty and the namesake of the later [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen]] [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys I]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Daenerys was the daughter of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]] and his sister-wife [[Naerys Targaryen]]. She was born in the year 182 AC.{{Ref|GOT106}} The sister of King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]], she also had numerous bastard half-brothers: [[Daemon Blackfyre]], [[Aegor Rivers]], [[Brynden Rivers]], and [[Shiera Seastar]] included.{{Cite}}

At 17 years old, Daenerys married the Prince of [[Dorne]], [[Maron Martell|Maron]] of [[House Martell]] at [[Dragonstone]].{{Ref|GOT106}} Their marriage helped solve the long question of Dornish independence by allowing for their unification into the realm.{{Cite}}

Daenerys died in childbirth three years later, at the age of 20. The child was stillborn.{{Ref|GOT106}} Maron and Daenerys had at least one child who survived beyond infancy, a crippled son who at one point was given a wheelchair as a present by Daenerys's brother Daeron II.{{Ref|GOT804}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Daenerys, along with her family, is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.{{Ref|GOT106}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Princess Daenerys was born well after her older brother, Daeron II, to the point that Daeron had already married and had a son, [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor Breakspear]]. Her betrothal to the Prince of Dorne, Maron Martell, was brokered by her brother Daeron as part of the treaty bringing Dorne under the authority of the [[Iron Throne]]. Daenerys supposedly loved her bastard half-brother, [[Daemon Blackfyre]]. It was said the main reason Daemon rose in [[Blackfyre Rebellion|rebellion]] against Daeron was that Daenerys was denied to him. A year after the rebellion concluded, in 197 AC, the marriage between Daenerys and Maron was carried out and Dorne formally joined to the rest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]].

After Daemon's death, Prince Maron built his new bride the [[Water Gardens]], a place of beauty made of colored marble with pools and trees. Her children played in the pools along with the children of other highborn lords. One day when the sun was particularly hot, she took pity on the children of the servants and guards and allowed them to play in the pools with the highborn children, starting a tradition that is still practiced in Dorne to this day.

While her brother's descendant Daenerys Stormborn is the third member of the Targaryen family to be named "Daenerys", Daenerys Stormborn is ''not'' called "Daenerys III", because the daughter of Aegon IV and the first Daenerys (the [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Jaehaerys I)|daughter of Jaehaerys I]], according to ''Fire & Blood'') never ruled as queens. In fact, there has never been a ruling Targaryen queen before. When Daenerys Stormborn proclaims herself the rightful heir of the Targaryen dynasty (after her [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|brother]] dies), she is officially styled as "Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of Her Name". This has been confirmed to be the same in the TV series continuity, as [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos|Xaro]] refers to her as "Daenerys, First of Her Name" in Season 2's episode "[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]", and this is also how she is formally introduced throughout the following seasons.
