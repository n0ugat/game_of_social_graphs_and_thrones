{{Quote|<u>The Lives of Four Kings</u>. Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read.|[[Tyrion Lannister]]|The Lion and the Rose}}
'''Kaeth''' was a [[Grand Maester]], and the author of the book ''[[The Lives of Four Kings]]''.{{Ref|GOT402}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Kaeth was made Grand Maester at the age of eighty, and sent to the court of King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V Targaryen]]. He died within a year of his appointment and was succeeded by Grand Maester Ellendor.

Kaeth's ''Lives of Four Kings'' is considered a literary classic, despite scanting [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys II Targaryen]], and his hand-drawn illuminations to be a masterpiece; only four original copies of his book survived, until [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] senselessly destroyed one at [[Purple Wedding|his wedding feast]].
