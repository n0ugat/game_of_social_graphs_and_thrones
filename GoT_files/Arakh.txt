The '''''arakh'''''{{Ref|GOT103}} is the standard weapon used by [[Dothraki]] warriors. It has a crescent moon-shaped, curved blade about two and a half feet long and a thick handle almost the same length, making it half-sword and half-scythe. Although unable to penetrate armor, the ''arakh'' gives the wielder tremendous maneuverability of wrists.[[File:Daario's weaponry.jpg|thumb|Daario's custom-made Dothraki ''arakh''.]] [[Jorah Mormont]] notes that while the sweeping blade is effective and indeed necessary for a warrior on horseback, the ''arakh'' pales in comparison to the [[Westeros]]i double-edged sword for battling without a mount or at penetrating armor.<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref>

Although a Dothraki weapon, it is occasionally employed by non-Dothraki, such as the [[Tyrosh]]i mercenary [[Daario Naharis]], captain of the [[Second Sons]].<ref>"[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"</ref>

==In the books==
The weapon overall is an original invention of [[George R.R. Martin]], but does bear some similarity to ancient "sickle-swords" such as the [[wikipedia:Khopesh|khopesh]], the [[wikipedia:tr:Orak|orak]], the [http://deadliestwarrior.wikia.com/wiki/Makraka makraka], and the [[wikipedia:Falx|falx]]. Martin's description of ''arakhs'' in the books (''A Game of Thrones'', Daenerys II) is: "...in the blink of an eye the ''arakhs'' were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe."

Martin's conception of ''arakhs'', however, actually differs from the ''arakhs'' produced for the TV series. When Martin described ''arakhs'' as "half-sword and half-scythe", he meant a curved blade similar to a [[wikipedia:Scimitar|scimitar]]. The TV series took his description literally, making a blade that starts out as a straight sword before turning into a circular, curved scythe-shape halfway through.

There are a very few arakhs made of [[Valyrian steel]]. Caggo, one of the captains of the [[Windblown]] sellsword company, carries one.

''Arakhs'' are best used in open spaces. In confined quarters, the ''arakh'''s length would become a serious drawback to its wielder, as happened to [[Hizdahr zo Loraq|Hizdahr]]'s bodyguard: while fighting against Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], the tip of his ''arakh'' grazed one of the wall hangings and hung, leaving him unprotected, then Selmy struck him down.

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "''Arakh''" is pronounced "Ah-rock", as opposed to "Ah-RACK".
