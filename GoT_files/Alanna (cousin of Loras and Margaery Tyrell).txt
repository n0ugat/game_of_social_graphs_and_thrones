'''Alanna''' is a cousin of [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] and [[Margaery Tyrell]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Alanna is mentioned by her cousin Margaery while chatting with [[Sansa Stark]]. According to Margaery, when she was 12, she was very clumsy and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture her. Alanna used to call Margaery "Pig-face," and whenever she passed Margaery in the halls, she would oink, so Margaery prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. Margaery tells Sansa that a week after that, Alanna came down with "porridge plague." Only when Margaery bursts out laughing, Sansa understands it is a joke. Sansa asks what has become of Alanna, and Margaery answers that she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. Margaery finds this very frustrating, but Sansa assures her that Alanna must be very jealous of her, now that she is going to become a queen.{{Ref|GOT304}}
