To meet the growing needs of the wiki, and in recognition of long and dedicated service, this page puts in motion the formal nomination process to promote [[User:Greater good]] from Administrator status to Bureaucrat status.

Greater Good has been a regular contributor to the wiki since February 2012 - before Season 2 - and worked here consistently for 6 years. He has made over 8,000 edits. He has gotten along well with everyone. Moreover, he's the only person who was already an Administrator by Season 4 who has not yet been promoted up to Bureaucrat status.

==Questions/Comments==

He's done several promotional things with Wikia too. On a private level, the other Bureaucrats live in the Americas, but Greater Good lives ''on'' the island of Ireland. I don't really travel, even to other cities within the US outside of New York. So hint hint, nudge nudge, I hope that in coming years of the prequel TV shows, Wikia can send him to local promotional events, conventions, etc. --[[User:The Dragon Demands|The Dragon Demands]] ([[User talk:The Dragon Demands|talk]]) 16:50, June 22, 2018 (UTC)

Then with unanimous support, including from two other Bureaucrats, it is done.

Let the word go forth throughout the land, that Greater good is now a Bureaucrat.--[[User:The Dragon Demands|The Dragon Demands]] ([[User talk:The Dragon Demands|talk]]) 16:12, August 2, 2018 (UTC)
