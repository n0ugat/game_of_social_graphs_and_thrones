{{Quote|[[Westeros]] has mighty rivers, but none of them compare to the [[Rhoyne]]. It is said that there is no stream or puddle in western [[Essos]], but drains to Mother Rhoyne.|[[Varys]]|The River Rhoyne}}
'''Mother Rhoyne'''{{Ref|H&L511}} is a deity associated with the [[Rhoyne]].

The [[Rhoynar]] were the greatest of Mother Rhoyne's children, and it is believed that she would whisper the secrets of their enemies to them, allowing the [[Rhoynish wizards]] to summon walls of water with which to defeat their foes.

Once the Rhoynar were defeated by the [[Valyrians]], Prince [[Garin the Great]] was captured, placed in a cage and forced to watch as the [[dragon]]s slaughtered his people and immolated his home city of [[Chroyane]]. Legend states that he called out to Mother Rhoyne to curse the Valyrians, and the city flooded with foul waters and a damp fog which caused their skin to harden and crack, giving birth to [[greyscale]].<ref>"[[The River Rhoyne]]"</ref><ref>"[[Greyscale and the Stone Men]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mother Rhoyne is the chief goddess of the [[Rhoynar]]. She is associated with the [[Rhoyne]], which is revered by the Rhoynar, and it is believed that her waters have nourished the Rhoynar since the dawn of days.
