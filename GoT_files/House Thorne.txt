'''House Thorne'''{{Ref|GOT104}}{{Note|Alliser's surname is Thorne.}} is a vassal house to [[House Targaryen]]. It is located within the [[Crownlands]] and holds fealty directly to the elected monarchs of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]].

==Members==

*Ser {[[Alliser Thorne]]}, a sworn brother of the [[Night's Watch]], former [[master-at-arms]] of [[Castle Black]] and [[First Ranger]]. Executed for mutinying against Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]].

==In the books==
As a vassal house sworn to [[King's Landing]], House Thorne contributed troops to the defense of the city during the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. Ser Alliser Thorne was on the walls when the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] troops stormed the [[Red Keep]]. He was wounded and captured; [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] gave him the choice between taking the black or being executed, and he chose the former.

Nothing else is known about the house, save its arms - a silver flail on a red background - and the fact that it still exists.

A historical member of the house is Ser Rickard Thorne, a [[Knighthood|knight]] of the [[Kingsguard]] who served during the reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]], and chose to side with King [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].
