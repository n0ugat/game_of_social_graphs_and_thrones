==Synopsis==
===At Harrenhal===
[[File:2x4 Daemon and Rhaenyra Still.jpg|thumb|Daemon dreams of a young Rhaenyra.]]
[[Daemon Targaryen]] dreams of the [[throne room]] and his wife [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] in her youth, who accuses him of wanting to destroy her, all because his brother, [[Viserys I Targaryen]], loved her more than he did Daemon. As Daemon beheads her with his sword, he's awakened by the Castellan of [[Harrenhal]], Ser [[Simon Strong]], who brings news of recent developments on the army of the [[Greens]]: [[House Stokeworth]] and [[House Rosby]] have both recanted their fealty to Rhaenyra and pledged their allegiance to King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] without a fight, citing the [[assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen]] as the reason for it.

Simon then announces the arrival of [[Oscar Tully]], grandson of Lord [[Grover Tully]] and heir to [[Riverrun]]. Daemon learns that Lord Grover is still alive, but incapable of doing much more than laying in his bed, posing a problem for the [[Blacks]], as the situation prevents the armies of [[House Tully]] from being raised in their name. Daemon bluntly suggests that Oscar kill his grandfather, but the latter is appalled at the suggestion, explaining that Lord Grover raised him as if he was his son, and the act would amount to [[kinslaying]]. Daemon retorts that he can now understand the state of disarray that the [[Riverlands]] are in, and since [[House Bracken]] has declared for the Greens, he will instead seek the aid of [[House Blackwood]].

[[File:2x4 Daemon and Alys Still.jpg|thumb|left|Daemon makes acquaintance with Alys Rivers.]]
At night time, Daemon imagines fighting noises coming from outside of his room, and goes to investigate them. He spots a figure who appears to be his nephew [[Aemond Targaryen]], and follows them in pursuit, but when he catches up to the figure, he sees that despite having Aemond's hair and eyepatch, their face is his own. Disturbed, he stumbles upon the quarters of [[Alys Rivers]], who introduces herself as a bastard and unofficial [[Order of Maesters|maester]] of Harrenhal, after the previous one fled in the night. Alys explains to Daemon that the castle is cursed, as [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] used [[weirwood]] trees in the castle's construction, and tensely prods him on his current predicament, musing how he must feel conflicted on serving a queen he doted on as a girl. Daemon grows angry, mocking Alys as a witch, but accepts her offer of a remedy to help him sleep better.

Daemon suddenly finds himself at the dining hall the next morning, in the company of Ser Simon and Ser [[Willem Blackwood]], the latter of who expresses his admiration for Rhaenyra and her spirit, recalling having attempted to propose to her in their youth. Daemon sees the image of his late wife [[Laena Velaryon]] in a servant as Ser Willem pledges the armies of his House, so long as House Bracken is made to answer for their treachery.

===On Driftmark===
[[File:2x4 Alyn and Rhaenys Still.jpg|thumb|Princess Rhaenys meets Alyn of Hull.]]
On the docks of [[Driftmark]], Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] goes to speak with [[Alyn of Hull]], the man who saved the life of her husband, Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]], at sea. Rhaenys observes his face and bitterly states his mother must have been very beautiful, a hint at Alyn's possible [[Bastard|bastardy]] from Corlys. The Lord of [[High Tide]] interrupts the conversation, but Rhaenys admits that the Captain's past is no fault of his own, and he should be celebrated for saving her husband's life, not hidden away.

Corlys pointedly asks if that's the reason why Rhaenys came to see him, but she explains that, in truth, she's received a summon from their granddaughter, [[Baela Targaryen]], requesting she return to [[Dragonstone]], as the recent absence of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] to seek peace with Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] in [[King's Landing]] has caused a power vacuum on the [[Black Council]], which Baela and her bethrothed, [[Jacaerys Velaryon]], find themselves struggling to manage on their own.

===In King's Landing===
Alicent is admiring a stone dragon figurine from her late husband's [[Old Valyria]] model set, when Grand Maester [[Orwyle]] knocks on the door, having brought [[Moon tea]], an abortifacient, as per her request, causing Alicent to drop the figurine, which shatters on the floor. Orwyle warns that the tea may have side effects (Alicent having told him it was for a girl in her service) for which Alicent thanks him for the warning.  As he moves to leave the room, she asks for his insight on who Viserys I wanted as his heir to the [[Iron Throne]], but Orwyle demurs, admitting Viserys never discussed the succession with him. Once Orwyle has departed, Alicent hastily drinks the moon tea, to avoid the possibility of falling pregnant following her trysts with Ser [[Criston Cole]].

[[File:2x4 Aegon II Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|left|Aegon struggles to keep his authority in the Green Council.]]
At a meeting of the [[Green Council]], Aegon angrily admonishes Lord [[Larys Strong]] for allowing Daemon to take over Harrenhal nearly unopposed, though Larys calmly states that the castle is in tatters and will likely drive Daemon to madness trying to repair it sufficiently to garrison an army, while all of the gold of [[House Strong]] lies safely within his hands. Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] suddenly interjects, announcing that Harrenhal will have to wait, because Ser Criston marches on [[Rook's Rest]], the seat of Black-aligned [[House Staunton]]. Aegon realizes his younger brother has been conducting war strategy without his authority, but is unable to provide a response when Aemond addresses him in [[High Valyrian]], as he struggles to form a sentence in the language. With the rest of the [[Small Council]] silently in agreement with Aemond, the course of the war is set.

[[File:2x4 Alicent Hightower Still.jpg|thumb|Alicent receives a visitor in her chambers.]]
Later the same day, Queen Alicent is visited by Larys, who noticed her absence from the Small Council meeting, and observes the cup of moon tea on Alicent's table. The [[Master of Whisperers]] stealthily implies he's aware of her relationship with Criston Cole, but chooses not to press the matter. The pair discuss Prince Daemon's capture of Harrenhal, Larys reiterating to Alicent he sees the castle's loss as a necessary sacrifice to keep the Blacks occupied, and Criston Cole's military successes in the Crownlands, before turning his attention to the books laid out open in front of Alicent (part of her effort to find any historical references to the dreams of [[Aegon I Targaryen]], spoken of by Viserys in his final hours). Larys prods Alicent when she claims to have shared her late husband's interest in history by asking if she believes Viserys looked to history when he chose to name Aegon his heir, noting that no matter how well suited he thought his eldest daughter for the crown, history would have told him how Westeros would react to Rhaenyra's succession. She concludes the conversation by somberly lamenting that her late husband's intentions are now meaningless; war is inevitable at this point, and Rhaenyra and Aegon's supporters will believe what they will to justify their actions in the coming conflict, to which Larys agrees.

[[File:2x4 Aegon and Alicent Still.jpg|thumb|left|Alicent coldly rebukes Aegon.]]
As the Green Council meets again on another morning, Aegon abruptly leaves when [[Jasper Wylde]] and [[Tyland Lannister]] heap praise upon Aemond and Ser Criston, declaring that they all bore him. He's surprised to find his mother in his private chambers, who scolds him for throwing away his late father's books. He responds that he simply had them removed, not burned, before confessing to feeling ignored by his Small Council and overshadowed by Aemond and Criston. Alicent is unsympathetic to his situation, mocking Aegon's belief that merely wearing the crown makes him wiser than men who studied and strove for years to earn their seats on the King's Council, and expressing her disappointment Aegon hasn't had the wit to silently learn from his more learned advisors so he might amount to even half the king his father was. Angered, Aegon rebukes her, but Alicent scoffs at his implied threat to either banish or execute her like his [[Otto Hightower|grandfather]] or the Red Keep's ratcatchers. Alicent reminds Aegon that, given she ruled in Viserys's stead during his illness and Otto Hightower's lengthy service as cunning statesman, he should be begging them for their opinions and counsel, rather than the other way around, bitterly adding Aegon has no idea what sacrifices were made to put him on the throne. When he earnestly asks for her wisdom, she sternly replies there is only one thing he should do: nothing.

[[File:S2 Sunfyre.png|thumb|Aegon meets with Sunfyre in preparation for battle.]]
Feeling despondent and with the need to prove himself as a ruler, Aegon heads to the [[Dragonpit]] to retrieve his dragon [[Sunfyre]], and together they fly off over King's Landing and towards Rook's Rest.

===On Dragonstone===
Baela Targaryen reports on her latest findings after riding [[Moondancer]]: the armies of Ser Criston, cautious of the threat of dragons, now mostly ride at night and under tree cover in the Riverlands, as they advance northwest towards an unknown destination. The lack of certainty irritates Ser [[Alfred Broome]], who grudgingly says she should've burned them earlier when she had the opportunity. Jacaerys defends Baela, as they only possess any information because of her efforts.

[[File:2x4 Corlys and Rhaenys Still.jpg|thumb|Corlys and Rhaenys with the Black Council.]]
The members of the [[Black Council]] bicker among themselves due to the lack of any word from Prince Daemon in recent days, the growing numbers of the Greens' army and the absence of Rhaenyra, until the arrival of Corlys Velaryon, who admonishes their disunity in the absence of their Queen, a sentiment shared by Rhaenys, who asserts Rhaenyra is doing everything she can to put an end to the conflict.

After many days of absence, Rhaenyra Targaryen returns to [[Dragonstone]], now with full certainty that Viserys wished for her to succeed him in the Iron Throne and aware peace with the Greens is no longer an option; she must fight or die. Jace briefly protests her journey to King's Landing as an unecessary risk, but assures everyone stands with her still. Rhaenyra is informed that Cole plans to march on Rook's Rest, as the keep of council member [[Simon Staunton]], and boldly states her intention to fly there on [[Syrax]] herself, but is convinced by Rhaenys that the best course of action is to send her and her mount [[Meleys]] there instead. Before the battle, as Jace protests she let him fight to secure her claim and his to the Iron Throne, she tells Jacaerys of Aegon the Conqueror's prophecy, the Song of Ice and Fire.

===At Duskendale and Rook's Rest===
[[File:S2 Darklyn Execution.jpg|thumb|Lord Darklyn is executed for treason to the Crown.]]
Ser Criston Cole and his army [[Sack of Duskendale|sack the town of Duskendale]], following numerous military successes of his campaign through the [[Crownlands]]. The Lord Commander promises mercy to any man who [[Bending the knee|bends the knee]] to King Aegon II and raises arms against Rhaenyra Targaryen. Lord [[Gunthor Darklyn]], loyal to the monarch who named his son, Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]] to her [[Queensguard]], refuses the terms of surrender and lambasts the "Kingmaker" for his dishonorable conduct, before being summarily [[Execution|executed]] by the latter for treason. Cole's squire brings him a message, prompting him to change course and order the army to go East, following the coastline, much to the confusion of Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]], who expected them to press towards Harrenhal.

Arriving at the vicinity of Rook's Rest, Ser Gwayne counsels that the best course of action is to rest up and wait until nightfall to conduct their attack on the castle, but Criston insists on pushing forward and striking at daylight. Gwayne reminds him of their recent encounter with Baela and Moondancer, and that the [[Blacks]] possess many dragons ready to strike at a moment's notice just from across the bay on Dragonstone. Ser Criston still remains confident in his plan.

[[File:OT2 Rook's Rest.png|thumb|left|The [[Battle at Rook's Rest]] about to begin.]]
The Green army begins marching out of their encampment in the nearby forest to assault Rook's Rest, deploying multiple siege weapons and hundreds of infantry. Ser Criston has the levies of Houses Rosby, Stokeworth, and Darklyn move forward while keeping the forces of [[House Targaryen]] and [[House Hightower]] in reserve. As they advance forward, Criston's army is met with heavy resistance from the Staunton garrison, who begin subjecting the attackers to multiple arrow volleys.

Their advance is halted when Meleys is spotted in the air, forcing the Greens to retreat back to the treeline. Gwayne admonishes Criston that this is the exact reason he opposed a daytime attack, but Criston reveals this is part of his plan, ordering two of his archers to launch signal arrows. This alerts a series of soldiers deeper in the forest to blow horns that finally reach Aemond, signaling for him and [[Vhagar]] to enter the battle. At that same moment, Aegon flies overhead atop Sunfyre, having departed King's Landing earlier to personally join the battle, much to Aemond's fury, who subsequently stalls his own entry into the fray.

[[File:2x4 Rhaenys Targaryen Still 2.jpg|thumb|Rhaenys on her mount in the battlefield.]]
With Aegon's unexpected entry into the engagement throwing his plan into disarray, Criston orders for more signal arrows to be fired as he rallies the Green army to join their king into battle, boosting their morale and reversing the retreat caused by the levies with sending the rest of his army in to battle. As Criston's army presses forward toward Rook's Rest, Rhaenys spots Aegon and Sunfyre and orders Meleys to attack. Aegon begins the battle with a blast of fire, but Meleys evades and then attacks from below. The battle-tested Meleys quickly gains the upper hand over her inexperienced opponent, slashing Sunfyre's belly with her talons and sending the smaller dragon plummeting towards the ground, drenching soldiers below in boiling blood from his wounds. Sunfyre manages to stay aloft, but Meleys attacks again as he climbs back into the sky, clamping her jaws around Sunfyre's right wing and ignoring his frantic bites at her head to dislodge her.

Suddenly, Lord Simon and the Staunton garrison see Vhagar's enormous body emerge from the treeline, much to the relief and awe of Criston and the Green army. As Meleys continues to assault Sunfyre, Rhaenys and Aegon both spot Aemond and Vhagar advancing on them. Initially relieved at his brother's intervention, Aegon becomes horrified as he realizes Aemond intends to attack both of them as Vhagar unleashes a blast of dragonfire. Rhaenys and Meleys manage to dodge the bulk of the blast, but Aegon and Sunfyre are struck head-on. Heavily injured, Sunfyre and Aegon freefall from a high-altitude, crashing into the nearby forest with great force, much to Criston's horror, who rides off to the impact site.

With Rhaenys and Meleys largely unharmed from Vhagar's attack and with Aegon and Sunfyre now incapacitated, the two fly seaward away from Rook's Rest. Despite being at a severe disadvantage against Aemond and the much larger Vhagar and with the opportunity to escape to safety, Rhaenys resolves to return to the battle instead. As Rhaenys circles back, Aemond spots Meleys as he flies over his brother's crash site and has Vhagar turn around to confront her. As the two dragons become entangled, both blasting one another with dragonfire, they also begin to fall out of the sky, sparking panic amongst the Green army on the ground. As Criston's army attempts to flee, Meleys breaks loose just above the ground and flies off, while Vhagar crashes into the battlefield violently, crushing dozens, if not, hundreds of men in the process, and knocking Criston unconscious from the impact.

Undeterred, Aemond and Vhagar swiftly recover, with Vhagar crushing more fleeing Green soldiers underfoot as she takes flight once again. Meanwhile, Rhaenys and Meleys, both exhausted and injured from the battle, prepare to depart back to Dragonstone. Rhaenys attempts to locate Vhagar both on the ground and in the air to no avail. As they fly over Rook's Rest, however, they are suddenly attacked from below by Vhagar, much in the same way as it was with Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon]] and [[Arrax]]. With Vhagar's massive jaws crushing down on Meleys's neck, both Rhaenys and Meleys struggle in vain to break free as Vhagar drags them skyward. Ultimately, Vhagar proves too strong, fatally crushing Meleys's neck in her jaws, with Meleys giving Rhaenys one last look before succumbing to her injuries. Vhagar then releases Meleys, with Rhaenys resigned to the same fate as her dragon as the two plummet from the sky, violently crashing into the walls of Rook's Rest as a blast of fire erupts from Meleys's body.

[[File:2x4 Aemond Targaryen Still 4.jpg|thumb|left|Aemond points Ser Criston to his brother's location.]]
Sometime after Rhaenys and Meleys's death, Criston rouses from unconsciousness to the horrid sight of his decimated army and the burnt-out battlefield. In the distance, he sees Ser Gwayne rallying what little remains of the Green army to push through the breach created by Meleys's body and capture Rook's Rest. Criston proceeds to make his way through the carnage towards Aegon's crash site, attempting to enlist the aid of a soldier, only to discover the man is merely an incinerated skeleton that disintegrates at his touch. Criston eventually arrives at Aegon's crash site in the forest, spotting both a severely injured Sunfyre and Aemond approaching with his sword unsheathed. As Criston inquires on Aegon's location, Aemond wordlessly points forward with Aegon's [[Valyrian steel dagger]], revealing his motionless, shattered body with Sunfyre curled around him. Speechless, Criston collapses to his knees in shock as Aemond departs.

==Behind the scenes==
*This episode premiered on July 7, 2024. In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] was born on the seventh day of the seventh moon of 74 AC.{{Bookref|F&B|11}} It is also a sacred day in the [[Faith of the Seven]] and the first episode of the ''[[World of Westeros]]'' to air on this date.
*The episode title derives from the chapter of ''Fire & Blood'' it is adapted from, "The Dying of the Dragons - The Red Dragon and the Gold." It also refers to the fight between [[Meleys]] and [[Sunfyre]], as well as the color of the Targaryen dragon on the respective banners of the [[Blacks]] and the [[Greens]].
**The working title of this episode was "A Dance of Dragons."{{Webref|name=Title |author=HeroOfRodden |date=August 27, 2023 |url=https://redanianintelligence.com/2023/08/27/episode-title-everything-we-know-about-house-of-the-dragon-big-battle/ |title=Episode Title & Everything We Know About House of the Dragon’s Next Big Battle |website=Redanian Intelligence |access-date=December 7, 2023 }}
*When [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] comments about [[Alyn of Hull|Alyn]]'s mother, her bitter tone implies she suspects that he is [[Corlys Velaryon|her husband]]'s bastard son. According to the book, [[Marilda of Hull|Marlida]] claimed that [[Laenor Velaryon]] was her children's father; the court fool Mushroom claimed they were fathered by Corlys.
*[[Meleys]] is the second dragon to die in the [[Dance of the Dragons]], following [[Arrax]] ("[[The Black Queen]]").
*[[Oscar Tully]]'s first name is a humorous reference to the ''Sesame Street'' character {{WPS|Oscar the Grouch}}, and so are the names of his great-grandfather (in the show - grandfather) [[Grover Tully|Grover]], his father Elmo, and his brother Kermit. The TV show condensed the characters of Elmo, Kermit, and Oscar into one character.
*It is the second time [[Grover Tully's son|Grover's unnamed son]] is mentioned in the show (following "[[The Princess and the Queen]]"). He is not mentioned at all in the book.
*Inciting Oscar to kill his grandfather is not out of character for Daemon, considering that he himself committed a [[kinslaying]] ("[[We Light the Way]]"). Yet the suggestion is rather ironic, in view of the words of House Tully - "Family, Duty, Honor."
