Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }} is a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Reyne]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]], who briefly served as a member of King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]'s [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]].

==Biography==
Martyn is a friend and flatterer of King [[Aegon II Targaryen]].<ref name="WBD" />

While in service to King Aegon, he greets his Lord Commander Ser Criston sitting on the steps of the Red Keep, without his sword fastened to his belt.  Criston asks Aegon if he appointed new knights to the Kingsguard, which he confirms, without the involvement of the Lord Commander as all previous members were.  During Small Council meetings, he is visibly bored holding his head up and slouching.  

He and Aegon’s other lickspittles are present as Aegon is beginning armored in Aegon the Conqueror’s Valyrian steel armor.  He and the others compliment his appearance and the armor them give him and Larys Strong space to speak.  Aegon decides to not fly that day and his friends suggest taking a squire out and Martyn adds that the squire is a virgin.  Aegon reminds them they swore on oath if celibacy which makes them all laugh, until he stares at them seriously, making him take Aegon  seriously.

The group then goes out with the new squire to the Cock in at King’s Landing where they pass by Ulf.  The group are all laughing at and teasing the timid squire so much, Aegon fails to notice their waitress is one of his sexual assault victims: Dyana. 

They move in to Sylvie’s brothel where they encounter Aemond after sleeping with Sylvi.  The very drunk Aegon begins to harass Aemond about this as the other watch silently, especially as Aemond leaves.

When Aegon storms off after being humiliated by Aemond in front of the Small Council, he follows Aegon to see his mother.  When Alicent orders them to leave they do so.

He and the other lickspittles watch in shock as the injured Aegon receives medical attention from Grand Maester Orwyle and other Maesters.

==Behind the scenes==
Martyn Reyne's character description reads as follows:
:''"A knight. Friend and flatterer of King Aegon II."''<ref name="WBD" />

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Martyn Reyne. House Reyne was still alive and active during the Dance of the Dragons, but no named members were described. There is only one line that briefly mentions "Lord Reyne" as one of the commanders in [[Jason Lannister]]'s army.
