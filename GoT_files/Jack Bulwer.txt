'''Jack Bulwer''',{{Con|ASOIAF}} nicknamed '''Black Jack''', was a [[ranger]] of the [[Night's Watch]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Along with [[Kegs]] and [[Mully]], he travels to the [[Prostitution|brothel]] in [[Mole's Town]]. They sit drinking and listening to a [[Mole's Town whore|whore]] belching out the melodies to popular songs. Jack correctly guesses that she is belching "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]." She compliments him on his hearing, but quips that it is a shame that he has a hangnail for a penis. They are later slaughtered when a group of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] led by [[Tormund]] and [[Styr]] [[Sack of Mole's Town|attack]] the village. News of their deaths soon reaches [[Castle Black]].{{Ref|GOT408}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jack Bulwer survives the [[battle for the Wall]]. At some point he's named [[First Ranger]]. Later, [[Jon Snow|Jon]] sends him and eight more rangers, among them [[Alliser Thorne]], to range beyond the Wall. Bulwer and two of the others (Garth Greyfeather and Hairy Hal) are killed by the wildling raider known as the Weeper, and their eyeless heads are brought to Castle Black.
