'''Whore's Gash'''{{Ref|H&L603}} is a major pirate den in the [[Basilisk Isles]], off the north coast of [[Sothoryos]].

In truth, there have actually been numerous towns named "Whore's Gash" over the centuries.  Every generation or so, the [[Free Cities]] send a fleet to scour the Basilisk Isles of pirates, burning their ramshackle settlements to the ground - such as [[Port Plunder]], [[Sty]], and Whore's Gash.  Within a year, however, a new settlement will pop up somewhere else to replace it, and the pirates will re-use the old names again.<ref>"[[The Summer Sea]]"</ref>

==In the books==
Whore's Gash is much the same.
