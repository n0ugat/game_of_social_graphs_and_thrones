A '''stableboy''' was a [[Smallfolk|lowborn]] servant attending the stables in the [[Red Keep]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Following the [[Massacre in the Red Keep|massacre of the Stark household]], he tries to stop [[Arya Stark|Arya]] as she retrieves [[Needle]] from a baggage cart in the Red Keep. Arya asks him to leave her alone, promising [[Eddard Stark|her father]] will reward him, but he exclaims that the [[Cersei Lannister|queen]] will reward him, and grabs her. Arya turns to him and unintentionally stabs him in the belly, killing him.{{Ref|GOT108}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the unnamed stableboy is the first person whom Arya kills.

The stableboy is armed with a pitchfork. Arya pleads him to help her saddle a horse, promising her father will reward him. He taunts Arya that her father is dead, and the queen will reward him. Arya grabs Needle and warns him to stay away, and when he grabs her, everything [[Syrio Forel]] has ever taught her vanishes in a heartbeat; caught in terror, the only lesson Arya can remember was the one [[Jon Snow|Jon]] has taught her - to stick with the pointy end.

Arya is shocked by the stableboy's death, although she acted in self-defence. She walks elsewhere, away from the stableboy's accusing eyes.{{Bookref|AGOT|50}}
