'''Dyana''' is a servant of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] and [[Helaena Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Dyana is raped by Aegon as she is serving him wine. Showing some sympathy, [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] subtly threatens and pays her to keep quiet about the incident, and gives her [[moon tea]] as a precaution. During Alicent's confrontation with her son regarding what he had done to Dyana, Helaena inquires about Dyana's absence from her and Aegon's apartments, as she is supposed to dress Aegon and Helaena's own children, [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Having left the service of the [[Red Keep]], Dyana is now working as a barmaid at a tavern in the city.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

[[Elinda Massey]] is sent by [[Mysaria]] to meet with Dyana. Dyana recognizes Elinda when she arrives at the door.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Dyana is serving thin broth to [[Ulf]] and other patrons in a tavern before she and Sylvi talk about how the royal family is feasting in the Red Keep instead of providing food for the starving commoners.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Dyana. It is mentioned, however, that Aegon II was a lecherous young man who frequently fondled the serving girls in the Red Keep, and it is said that he fathered a bastard on one of his sister-wife Helaena's handmaids. Alicent didn't give that handmaid moon tea in the book, but Alicent's dialogue to Aegon in the episode implies that this isn't the first time he has sexually assaulted one of the castle servants.
