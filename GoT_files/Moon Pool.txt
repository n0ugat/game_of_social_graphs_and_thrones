{{Quote|The greatest bravos call themselves water dancers after the custom of dueling upon the moon pool near the Sealord's Palace.|[[Tycho Nestoris]]|Braavos (short)}}
The '''Moon Pool'''{{Ref|H&L504}} is a fountain located near the [[Sealord's Palace]] in [[Braavos]], so named because the [[bravo]]s practice the swordsmanship upon it.<ref>"[[Braavos (short)|Braavos]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Moon Pool is located south of the [[Sealord's Palace]] and before the headquarters of the [[House of Black and White]]. It is situated near several of the city's best alehouses, inns and brothels, and the [[Sweetwater River]] ends at it. The [[bravo]]s often duel at it at night.

[[Arya Stark]] sometimes sells shellfish at the Moon Pool. [[Dareon]] sings at the fountain when he spends some time there with [[Samwell Tarly]] and [[Gilly]] on their voyage to [[Oldtown]], and earns a kiss from a courtesan called the Moonshadow.
