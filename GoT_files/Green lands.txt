'''Green lands'''{{Ref|GOT203}} is a term employed by the [[Ironborn]] to refer to the mainland of [[Westeros]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the term gives an insight on how the ironborn view the mainland of Westeros: fertile fields with soft, weak people, unlike the [[Iron Islands]], which have harsh, poor land that has bred hardy and fierce men.
