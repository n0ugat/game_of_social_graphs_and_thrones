{{Quote|In the far southwest of Westeros, at the mouth of the river Honeywine, lies the great stone city of Oldtown.

'''Oldtown'''{{Ref|GOT504}} is the second largest and most populated city in the [[Seven Kingdoms]], and by far the oldest major city in [[Westeros]], dating back to the time of the [[First Men]]. It is located in the far southwest of the continent, at the mouth of the River [[Honeywine]] where it opens into Whispering Sound and the [[Sunset Sea]] beyond.

The major highway known as the [[Roseroad]] begins at Oldtown, then runs northeast past [[Highgarden]] before finally reaching [[King's Landing]] on the east coast. The [[Searoad]] also forks off from the Roseroad at Highgarden, going northwest so travelers from Oldtown can reach [[Lannisport]].

Oldtown is the seat of [[House Hightower]], who hold fealty to [[Bronn's house]] of Highgarden, from the eponymous [[Hightower]]. The city is also notable as the site of the [[Citadel]], home of the [[Order of Maesters]], as well as the [[Starry Sept]], the former center of the [[Faith of the Seven]] in Westeros (it has since been supplanted by the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] in King's Landing).

==History==
[[File:The Conqueror marches on Oldtown.png|thumb|[[Aegon I Targaryen|The Conqueror]] marches on Oldtown.]]

=== Background ===
During the invasion of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], the [[High Septon]] of the time prayed and fasted for seven days and seven nights on whether the Hightowers should resist Aegon's army. He reportedly received a vision from the [[Crone]] showing Oldtown's destruction should they attempt this. At his recommendation, the then-Lord Hightower threw open the city gates and welcomed Aegon into the city with open arms. Aegon dated the first day of his reign to his welcome into Oldtown.

Oldtown officially supplants King's Landing as the most populated city, after the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. 

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Oldtown was the largest city in [[Westeros]] before [[Aegon's Conquest]]. It survived for so long through canny politicking by the ruling Hightowers, who trace their ancestry back to the First Men. In time, through patronage of local kings of the First Men, the [[Order of Maesters]] was founded in Oldtown, a guild of scholars and healers, with their headquarters located at the Citadel in the city.

When the [[Andals]] invaded, the Hightowers, then kings in their own right, welcomed them openly and swore fealty to them as [[King of the Reach|Kings of the Reach]]. Oldtown's pre-eminence was confirmed when the [[Faith of the Seven]] built the [[Starry Sept]] there.

During the invasion of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], the [[High Septon]] of the time prayed and fasted for seven days and seven nights on whether the Hightowers should resist Aegon's army. He reportedly received a vision from the [[Crone]] showing Oldtown's destruction should they attempt this. At his recommendation, the then-Lord Hightower threw open the city gates and welcomed Aegon into the city with open arms. Aegon dated the first day of his reign to his welcome into Oldtown.

Oldtown is almost as large and populous as King's Landing, but is far cleaner, more beautiful and more efficiently run. King's Landing was rapidly constructed within the first century of rule by the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]]. This rapid expansion didn't keep pace with organized "city-planning", resulting in numerous slums forming such as the district known as [[Flea Bottom]]. Many of these slum districts are poorly organized, ugly, and filthy because their placement wasn't thought out during the rush to slap down new buildings. By contrast, Oldtown is thousands of years old and grew only in incremental steps which were well planned out beforehand. The result is that Oldtown is a much better organized and beautiful city without the squalid slums of King's Landing, while being only slightly smaller than the capital itself. Oldtown also has its own City Watch, separate from the [[City Watch of King's Landing]].

Oldtown is famed for its meandering, cobbled streets and many fine inns and [[sept]]s. It has an immense port which plays host to ships from across the Seven Kingdoms, the [[Free Cities]], and even the distant [[Summer Isles]]. The port and the entire city is dominated by the Hightower, a massive, seven-sided, stepped lighthouse rising from Battle Island. More than 800 feet high, it is the tallest structure in Westeros, higher even than the [[Wall]]. It serves as House Hightower's keep, as well as a lighthouse.

Oldtown has had the misfortune, as a large city, of being struck twice by major plagues in the past century. In 209 AC, a great pandemic known as the [[Great Spring Sickness]] swept across all of the Seven Kingdoms. It killed tens of thousands, particularly in the major cities. It was bad in [[Lannisport]], worse in Oldtown, but worst of all in King's Landing, where two out of every five persons died. The death count wasn't quite as severe in Oldtown, but still high. Only one generation later, during [[Pycelle]]'s youth (220s to 230s AC), Oldtown itself was hit by an even worse disease, the "grey plague" (a more deadly cousin of [[Greyscale]]). According to Pycelle, the outbreak killed up to half of Oldtown's population, and three quarters of the maesters in the Citadel. The only reason it didn't become another, even more destructive pandemic is because Lord Quenton Hightower ordered the gates of the city sealed and all ships in the harbor burned to prevent the disease being spread further. While this did prevent another pandemic, many trapped inside the city's quarantine caught the disease from those who were already sick, and perished. After the quarantine ended, the survivors dragged Lord Quenton and his young son from their horses and slit their throats. By the time of the [[War of the Five Kings]], some seventy years later, Oldtown's population is slightly smaller than that of King's Landing, but it may have been larger over a century ago, before the double-blow of these two epidemics, and when King's Landing was smaller.

No one knows exactly how old the city really is, as it's true origins stretch back before history and into oral tradition. There was always a major settlement at the mouth of the Honeywine (though it did grow and expand considerably over the millennia). The First Men apparently founded the original town that later became a city relatively soon after they first began migrating into Westeros 12,000 years ago, across the nearby [[Arm of Dorne|land-bridge]] at the time linking [[Dorne]] and [[Essos]]. A few maesters argue that there may have been even earlier settlements at the mouth of the Honeywine that the First Men built over - perhaps a trading post maintained by anyone from the [[Valyrians]] to the [[Rhoynar]] to the Summer Islanders (or a combination of them), where their fishing fleets could take on fresh water and perhaps even trade with the non-human races that dominated Westeros's wild forests at the time (the [[Children of the Forest]] and the [[Giants]]). The base of the Hightower and underground levels seem to be the remnant of some ancient structure, made of an oily black stone found in a few other ruins across the world. The evidence, however, is very sketchy and inconclusive.

Oldtown remains aloof from the War of the Five Kings. In the fourth novel, [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]] launches a massive raid along the coast, conquering the [[Shield Islands]] and parts of the [[Arbor]], then trying to blockade the mouth of the [[Honeywine]]. An ironborn attack on the city's harbor is repulsed by the city's defenders, but Oldtown remains under threat from the ironborn.

===Inspiration===
Oldtown bears many similarities to real-life [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria Alexandria]. This Egyptian city - founded in the 4th Century BCE by Alexander the Great - was (and still is) a major port on the Mediterranean Sea, receiving ships and cargoes from all over the world. The Citadel of Oldtown, with its enormous library and status as a place of learning, is very similar to the famed Library of Alexandria, the preeminent educational center of its time. Perhaps most strongly, the Hightower of Oldtown is a clear parallel to Alexandria's famous lighthouse, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
