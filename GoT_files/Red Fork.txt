The '''Red Fork''',{{Ref|GOT110}} also known as the '''Red Fork River''',{{Ref|GOT302}} is one of the three main rivers of the [[Trident]]. The longest branch, it rises in the [[Westerlands]] and flows north to a confluence with its tributary, the [[Tumblestone]], which flows from the northwest. The [[House Tully]] castle of [[Riverrun]] is located where the two rivers meet. The Red Fork then flows east through the center of the [[Riverlands]] to where it joins the main body of the Trident. The lands along the Red Fork of the Trident are located in the very heart of the entire continent of [[Westeros]].
