'''Winterfell'''{{Ref|GOT101}} is the capital of the [[North|Kingdom of the North]] and the seat and the ancestral home of the royal [[House Stark]]. It is a very large castle located at the center of the North, from where the head of House Stark rules over his or her people. 

During the [[War of the Five Kings]], Winterfell is seized by the Starks' enemies, first [[Capture of Winterfell|by the Ironborn]], and later by the Boltons. Eventually the Starks liberate Winterfell. In the subsequent [[Great War]], Winterfell is the site of the [[Battle of Winterfell|great battle]] between the [[Wight|Army of the Dead]] and the Starks and their allies.

==History==
===Background===
According to legend, [[House Stark]] has held Winterfell for 8,000 years, though it has been considerably expanded upon over the centuries.<ref>"[[The Age of Heroes]]"</ref> It was said to have been built by House Stark's founder, [[Brandon the Builder|Bran the Builder]], during the [[Age of Heroes]], who was also said to have constructed the [[Wall]] and even [[Storm's End]]. 

The castle is located alongside the [[Kingsroad]] as it makes its way from the [[Wall]] to the capital of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]], [[King's Landing]], more than a thousand miles to the south. A small [[godswood]] is enclosed within the walls. It is situated atop hot springs which keep the castle warm even in the worst winters. Winding tombs below the castle contain the remains of Stark [[King in the North|kings]] and lords and record the history of the ancient family.<ref name=":0">"[[Winter Is Coming]]"</ref> The castle has stood for millennia.

==Behind the scenes==
For the television series, a variety of locations were used to create Winterfell as it appears on screen. For the pilot, [[wikipedia:Doune Castle|Doune Castle]] in [[wikipedia:Scotland|Scotland]] was used for some exterior shots and the great feast held when King [[Robert Baratheon]] and his party arrive. [[wikipedia:Castle Ward|Castle Ward]] in [[wikipedia:County Down|County Down]], [[wikipedia:Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]] was used for the scenes of sparring in Winterfell's castle yard and the arrival of Robert's party at Winterfell's gates. The rest of the castle, including the other interiors and the scenes involving [[Bran Stark|Bran]] climbing the walls, were filmed as interiors at the [[Paint Hall]] studio facility in [[wikipedia:Belfast|Belfast]]. For the first season itself, Castle Ward was the principal filming location for the Winterfell scenes. Doune Castle was not revisited. One of the only full scenes from Doune Castle to survive from the pilot is the scene in the crypts of Winterfell when Eddard and Robert visit Lyanna's grave. All subsequent appearances of the Winterfell crypts from Season 2 onward were filmed in the cellars of [[Wikipedia:Shane's Castle|Shane's Castle]] in Northern Ireland.

While it isn't visible on-camera at all, the cellars of Shane's Castle are infested with numerous spiders. Any scenes in the cellars involving candles with open flames (all of them, because it is dark) will make swarms of spiders crawl out of their hiding places to scramble away from the heat source. The actors report that while the camera can't see them, they can, and there are so many they can ''hear'' them - and even ''feel'' them falling onto them. The actors don't like filming scenes in the cellar as a result.<ref name=":5">[http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/39270/game-of-thrones-season-5-what-we-learned-from-the-blu-rays Season 5 Blu-ray commentary]</ref>

As of the end of Season 5, Winterfell is one of three locations (the others being [[King's Landing]] and [[Castle Black]]/the [[Wall]]) to be featured in every opening credits sequence, regardless as to whether the location is actually visited in the episode (this includes Season 3 and virtually all of Season 4 during which Winterfell is never visited nor seen at all).

As explained in the Blu-ray commentary, the main Winterfell set was greatly expanded in Season 5. The original sets from Seasons 1 and 2 primarily consisted of the outer courtyard, the feast hall, and one interior bedroom which could be redressed (for Eddard and Catelyn's room, Bran's room, etc.), but otherwise there wasn't an extensive interconnected interior set. For Season 5, the production team constructed a complex of staircases, corridors and bedrooms, all added on top of the existing courtyard and feast hall.<ref name=":5" />

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Winterfell is a huge castle complex spanning several acres, consisting of two massive walls with a ditch between them and a village located just outside. The complex consists of many buildings and keeps, some ancient and decrepit, some in good repair. According to legend, Winterfell was built by Bran the Builder eight thousand years ago.

The castle has been built over natural hot springs, and the scalding waters rush through its walls and chambers like blood through a man’s body, driving the chill from the stone halls, filling the glass gardens with a moist warmth, keeping the earth from freezing. Open pools smoke day and night in a dozen small courtyards. In summer, it is insignificant; in winter, it is the difference between life and death.

There is no mentioning in the novels that there are any hidden passageways in the castle.

The full castle as it appears at the start of the narrative has not been standing for eight thousand years: it was gradually expanded over many centuries like a tree growing new branches, giving it a less organized appearance than large castles which were planned out all at once such as the Red Keep in King's Landing. Parts have also had to be rebuilt over time, either due to natural degeneration or damage in sieges (Winterfell was burned out several times in ancient wars with the Boltons and other enemies, but the Starks always rallied and rebuilt it). The eldest surviving part of the castle is the First Keep, an old tower no longer actively used, which some maesters think dates back to some point ''after'' the Andal Invasion began six thousand years ago.

The crypts underneath Winterfell are massive - larger than the entire castle complex above ground. This is a testament to just how long the Starks have held Winterfell: according to tradition, there should be eight thousand years' worth of tombs in the crypts. According to tradition, while all Stark family members are buried in the crypts, statues are only made for those who were head of House Stark (either as kings or later as lords). There have been some exceptions over the generations, and Eddard himself had statues made at the tombs of his older brother Brandon and his sister Lyanna. The most ancient tombs are in the lower levels, and the more current ones closer to the surface. Many of the lower levels are half-collapsed and unexplored. With their vast size and lack of active use, it is quite easy for someone to hide in the crypts for weeks or even months at a time, as Bran, Rickon, and their followers did during the Sack of Winterfell, provided that they bring sufficient supplies with them. According to legend, when the infamous wildling rogue Bael the Bard seduced the daughter of a Stark lord, they hid out in the crypts for nearly a year undetected, long enough that when the daughter one day reappeared in her chambers she had with her the infant son that she had with Bael.
