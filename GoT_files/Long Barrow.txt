{{Quote|A long time ago, you may have had men from Queensgate and Long Barrow and the other sixteen castles of the Wall come to Castle Black for an election.|[[Alliser Thorne]]|The Lord Commanders}}
'''Long Barrow'''{{Ref|H&L507}} is a castle on the [[Wall]].<ref>"[[The Lord Commanders]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Long Barrow is an abandoned castle on the [[Wall]] located between Rimegate to west and the Torches to the east.

[[Mance Rayder]] tells [[Jon Snow|Jon]] that he once climbed the Wall near Long Barrow, when he traveled to [[Winterfell]] for [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]]'s visit in the guise of a bard.

Jon plans to re-garrison the castle with men from [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. The [[Lord of Bones]] is seen near Long Barrow shortly before the [[battle for the Wall]], and is captured there by [[Cotter Pyke]].

Following an alliance with the [[Free Folk]], Jon re-garrisons the castle with [[Spear wife|spearwives]] under the command of Iron Emmett with [[Eddison Tollett]], which inspires the men of the [[Night's Watch]] to call it "Whore's Barrow."
