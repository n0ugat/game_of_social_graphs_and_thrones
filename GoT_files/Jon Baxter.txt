Ser '''Jon Baxter''' was a [[First Ranger]] of the [[Night's Watch]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Jon was appointed First Ranger by [[Willem of the Dun Fort]]. This was met with dissent from other members of the Night's Watch, as Jon was considered incompetent due to his heavy drinking. Willem defended his decision by threatening to imprison the protesters in an ice cell, and Jon was allowed to keep his position. He eventually overcame his addiction, swearing off alcohol entirely after an accident, and served as First Ranger for over twenty years under Willem and his successor [[Brynden Stone]].<ref>[[:File:5x2 Night's Watch Book.jpg]]</ref>
