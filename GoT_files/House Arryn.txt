'''House Arryn'''{{Ref|GOT604}} of the [[Eyrie]] is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. It has ruled over the [[Vale of Arryn]] for millennia, originally as the [[King of the Mountain and the Vale|Kings of the Mountain and the Vale]] and more recently as [[Defender of the Vale|Defenders of the Vale]] and [[Warden of the East|Wardens of the East]] under the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]], [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|Baratheon]], and [[House Lannister|Lannister]] dynasties. The nominal head of House Arryn is [[Robin Arryn]] with [[Yohn Royce]] holding actual power over the house.

Their lands are in the central-eastern region of the continent. Their seat is the Eyrie, a castle on a shoulder of the [[Giant's Lance]]. House Arryn's sigil is a white crescent moon and falcon on a blue field. Their [[house words]] are "As High as Honor."<ref>"[[House Arryn (short)|House Arryn]]"</ref>

==History==
===Background===
According to legend, the house was founded by Ser [[Artys Arryn]], the Winged Knight. He is said to have flown atop a giant falcon, landing on the topmost mountain of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], and [[Battle of the Seven Stars|defeated]] the [[Griffin King]], the last of the [[First Men]] [[Mountain King]]s. Afterward, he took the [[Eyrie]] and became the first [[King of the Mountain and the Vale]]. His descendants continued to rule the Vale ever since. The Eyrie has never fallen to invaders. During [[Aegon's Conquest]], House Arryn repulsed a Targaryen invasion at [[Gulltown]] with [[Braavos]]i aid, but ultimately bent the knee peacefully to Queen [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] after young boy-king [[Ronnel Arryn|Ronnel]] yielded the crown and Queen Regent [[Sharra Arryn|Sharra]] ordered the Vale's army to stand down, for which Ronnel was allowed to ride [[Vhagar]] with the Queen.. By submitting peacefully instead of being conquered, they were allowed to continue to rule as Lords Paramount of the Vale and Wardens of the East in the name of the [[Iron Throne]].<ref>"[[House Arryn (short)|House Arryn]]"</ref><ref name="Arryn viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/arryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Arryn entry]</ref> The Eyrie is considered impregnable and defends House Arryn from the violent [[Hill tribes]] of the [[Mountains of the Moon]].<ref name="Arryn viewers guide" />

[[Jon Arryn]] is the most recent head of House Arryn, Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale. He was a respected nobleman and both [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Robert Baratheon]] fostered with him.<ref name="Jon Arryn viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/arryn/jon-arryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Arryn - Jon Arryn entry]</ref> The [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] condoned the kidnap of Eddard's sister and Robert's betrothed, [[Lyanna Stark]].<ref name="E01">"[[Winter Is Coming]]"</ref> The Mad King had Eddard's [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]] killed for protesting against the kidnapping.<ref name="E03">"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref> When he then demanded that Eddard be turned over to the King's justice, Lord Arryn rebelled, calling his banners to [[Robert's Rebellion|war]]. [[House Stark]] and [[House Baratheon]] followed suit.

After the rebel victory in the war, Robert became King and appointed Jon as his [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. He [[Assassination of Jon Arryn|died]] immediately prior to the events of the series, sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Jon is survived by his wife Lysa and their six-year-old son, [[Robin Arryn|Robin]].<ref name="E01" /> Jon was investigating the legitimacy of the children of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] when he died. He found that they were not Robert's offspring by comparing their appearance to Robert's bastards based on the genetic preponderance for dark hair in House Baratheon.<ref name="E06">"[[A Golden Crown]]"</ref>

==Symbolism==
[[File:The Eyrie.jpg|thumb|200px|View on the [[Eyrie]] in "[[The Wolf and the Lion]]".]]
The banner of House Arryn (see above) is blue, the color of the sky, and features a falcon and the moon. All of these things signify that the house is high up, in this case, in the mountains. To further this point, in "[[Mockingbird]]", after [[Sansa Stark]] builds a snow model of [[Winterfell]], [[Robin Arryn]] finds it and inquires whether Winterfell has a moon door. When Sansa tells him it is not in the mountains so no, he worries that must be very dangerous.

The house motto is "As High as Honor", signifying that like [[House Stark]], they believe in upholding honor. However, unlike House Stark, they believe in "talking the talk" as opposed to 'walking the walk", which is suggested by House Stark's motto "Winter Is Coming". When [[Tyrion Lannister]] calls for a [[trial by combat]] in "[[A Golden Crown]] and [[Bronn]] therefore fights for him, Bronn implements many clever moves, something that is ultimately the downfall of Ser [[Vardis Egen]], the champion selected by [[Lysa Arryn]]. After Bronn pushed Egen out of the Moon Door, Lysa Arryn furiously claims he "fought without honor" to which Bronn replies "no, he did" and points out of the Moon Door. Unfortunately, it can be seen that House Arryn lost their honor and pride during the [[War of the Five Kings]] under the corrupt leadership of Lysa Arryn.

== Military strength ==
[[File:Arryn man-at-arms.jpg|thumb|160px|right|House Arryn soldier in Season 1.]]
During the [[War of the Five Kings]], House Arryn, as a [[Great House]], commands formidable and capable forces but remain largely unscathed, since the Arryns never partake in the war until the [[Battle of the Bastards]], where they arrive late in battle, thus not taking significant losses. During the [[Great War]], House Arryn forces participate in the [[Battle of Winterfell]] and suffer large casualties (half the forces that the Vale sent to Winterfell are obliterated). Despite their losses, they later participate in the [[Battle of King's Landing]], supporting [[Daenerys Targaryen]].

Arryn soldiers equip themselves much like the rest of the Valemen, with steel cuirasses, chainmail, and simple helmets, while their rounded shields represent the moon-and-falcon sigil. Their armor lacks ornamentation, in comparison with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] or the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]], but is more functional than the Northmen's and the Rivermen's armor. Knights sworn to House Arryn, however, like Ser [[Vardis Egen]], can afford more plate armor parts than a regular soldier, like arm and leg protection, and can have their armor ornamented.

==In the books==
[[File:House Arryn ASOIAF.svg|thumb|200px|right|The Arryn coat of arms in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels: a sky-blue falcon soaring against a white moon on sky-blue.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Arryn is the oldest and purest line of [[Andals|Andal]] nobility. According to tradition, the Andals [[Coming of the Andals|landed]] on the [[Fingers]], an area of peninsulas, hills, and rivers on [[Westeros]]'s eastern coast, six thousand years ago and helped conquer the Vale. [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Artys Arryn]]'s duel with the [[Griffin King]] is said to have taken place on the shoulder of the [[Giant's Lance]] where the Arryns later built the [[Eyrie]].

During [[Aegon's Conquest]], the Arryns planned to make a stand at the [[Bloody Gate]], the only major pass into the Vale, and gathered their armies there while the [[Ronnel Arryn|king of the Vale]] (a young boy at this time) and his [[Sharra Arryn|mother]], the regent, took refuge in the Eyrie. Rather than risking a bloody battle, [[Visenya Targaryen]] simply flew her dragon [[Vhagar]] to the Vale and landed in the courtyard of the Eyrie while the young king was at play. He agreed to swear fealty to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] if Visenya allowed him to ride on Vhagar. Visenya agreed, the bargain was upheld, and the Arryns and their vassals became loyal subjects of the Targaryens.<ref>So Spake Martin, [http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Bubonicon_Report/ Bubonicon Report]</ref>

House Arryn also boasts the distinction of three times being deemed worthy of marriage into House Targaryen (who usually opted for the Valyrian tradition of incestuous marriage to keep their bloodlines pure). Perhaps the most famous example was [[Aemma Arryn]], the first wife of King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]] and the mother of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]. In a tribute to her mother, Rhaenyra even created her own unique heraldry that incorporated the Arryn sigil.

During the summer they rule over the Vale from the Eyrie, but during the winter they descend to the Gates of the Moon, a castle at the foot of the mountain. The Gates of the Moon have not appeared in the television adaptation and the House Arryn is depicted residing at the Eyrie in winter.

Jon Arryn and Lysa Tully's son is called "Robert", not "Robin", in the books. This change was made to prevent confusion with Robert Baratheon or Robb Stark. [[George R.R. Martin]] approved this change, noting that Robert Arryn's nickname in the books, "Sweetrobin", remains intact.

In the books, the [[heraldry]] of House Arryn is specifically sky blue (bleu celeste), but in the TV series it is simply blue (azure), like House Tully's heraldry. The coat of arms is also a little different: a sky-blue falcon soaring against a white moon, on a sky-blue field.
