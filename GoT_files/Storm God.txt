The Storm God is believed to dwell in a castle in the clouds and to send winds and waves to lure Ironborn off course or wreck their ships. Ironborn believe that it was the Storm God who blew the [[Andals]] to the Iron Islands.

Legends also tell that the [[Grey King]] waged war against the Storm God for a thousand years.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Storm God is the "evil" deity in the ironborn religion, fighting against their creator, the Drowned God.
