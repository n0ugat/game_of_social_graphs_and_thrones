Ser '''Daemon Sand'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] [[Knighthood|knight]] and [[bastard]]. He serves as [[Oberyn Martell]]'s [[squire]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[File:Daemon spear.png|thumb|left|Daemon squiring for Prince Oberyn.]]
Daemon squires for Oberyn Martell during [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion's trial by combat]], and coats the spearheads of his master's weapons with deadly [[manticore]] [[Poison|venom]]. He witnesses the Red Viper's death at the hands of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].{{Ref|GOT408}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Daemon Sand, also known as "The Bastard of Godsgrace", is Ser Ryon Allyrion's [[Bastard|natural born son]]. He serves Oberyn Martell as squire, and received his knighthood from the Red Viper himself. There are also rumors that he is one of Oberyn's lovers, though this is seldom said to his face. He is considered to be one of Dorne's finest swordsmen. 

Daemon is close friends with Arianne Martell, daughter and heir of Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]], and took her maidenhood when they were both fourteen. When Prince Doran learned of this he didn't seek to punish Daemon, but refused to allow him to marry his daughter.

Daemon is first introduced when he arrives at King's Landing among Oberyn's retinue. In ''A Feast for Crows'', [[Qyburn]] informs [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] that Daemon was imprisoned at Doran's command, because he demanded that the [[Sand Snakes]] - who were imprisoned to prevent them from igniting a war with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] - be released. Eventually, Doran has him freed alongside Princess Arianne and the Sand Snakes.

Daemon is present at the feast when Ser [[Balon Swann]] arrives at [[Sunspear]] to deliver the Mountain's head. He is one of those who express their disapproval by not joining the toast Doran makes to King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]].

Currently, he is escorting Arianne to meet the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]] and [[Jon Connington]]; Daemon believe they are impostors.

House Allyrion belongs to the group known as "Salty Dornishmen", who live along the coasts of [[Dorne]] and the [[Greenblood]] river system. This group has the most [[Rhoynar]] blood of all [[Dornishmen]] and generally possess olive skin, dark hair, and dark eyes. Daemon's brief appearance in Season 4 of the TV series did not resemble this, but as it turns out, in the books he is not described as having classic "salty Dornish" features. Instead, he is said to have sky blue eyes and light sandy brown hair. The simple explanation may be that he takes after his non-Allyrion parent in looks, and this parent was either a "stony Dornishman" from the western mountains, or possibly from somewhere outside of Dorne entirely.
