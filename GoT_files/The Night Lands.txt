==Synopsis==
=== In the Riverlands ===
[[File:Arya and Gendry 2x02.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Arya hides from the Gold Cloaks.]]
In the [[Riverlands]], [[Arya Stark]] continues to pose as a boy while traveling north with [[Yoren]] and his [[Night's Watch]] recruits. She urinates privately to conceal that she is a girl. Arya is drawn to the caged prisoners containing [[Jaqen H'ghar]], [[Rorge]] and [[Biter]]. Jaqen asks her for water and introduces himself. A pair of [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]] approach the party and Arya hides, believing that they have come for her. They deliver a warrant for [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], one of Robert Baratheon's [[bastard]] children, but [[Yoren]] intimidates them into leaving empty-handed. They promise to return with more men.

Arya asks Gendry why he is wanted and he admits that he does not know. He tells her that he was questioned by Lord [[Jon Arryn]] and Lord [[Eddard Stark]] in the months before he fled [[King's Landing]]. He questions why she thought that they had come for her and tells her that he has seen through her disguise. Arya reveals her identity to him and swears him to secrecy.

=== In King's Landing ===
In King's Landing, [[Varys]] discovers [[Shae]] living with [[Tyrion Lannister]] in the [[Tower of the Hand]] and makes implied threats about revealing her presence. Tyrion warns Varys not to underestimate him. [[Alton Lannister]] delivers King [[Robb Stark]]'s peace terms to the [[Small Council]] and Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]] rejects them. [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] relays a message from the [[Night's Watch]] requesting manpower and warning of [[wight]]s. Tyrion is the only one to take the warning seriously.

[[Ros]] struggles to continue her work as a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] after having witnessed the murder of [[Mhaegen]]'s infant daughter [[Barra]], one of Robert Baratheon's bastard children. [[Petyr Baelish]] threatens her with a tale about selling an unhappy girl to a depraved customer in order to recoup his investment. He orders her to return happy after a night off.

Tyrion has dinner with Lord [[Janos Slynt]] and questions him about the [[Massacre in King's Landing|massacre of the royal bastards]]. Janos freely admits his involvement but will not reveal who ordered the attack. Tyrion has Janos arrested and exiled to the [[Night's Watch]] and installs [[Bronn]] as [[Lord Commander|Commander]] of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] in his place. Cersei confronts Tyrion about his actions. He warns that she is losing the support of the people but she claims that she does not care. He concludes that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] ordered the massacre, having initially suspected that it was Cersei. He jokes about her relationship with [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and she says that he has always been funny. She ends the discussion with the barb that his finest joke was killing [[Joanna Lannister|their mother]] when he was born.

=== On Dragonstone ===
[[File:Davos and Salladhor at Dragonstone.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Davos walks on Dragonstone with Salladhor and Matthos.]]
On [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] recruits the [[Lys]]ene [[Mercenary#Sellsails|sellsail]] [[Salladhor Saan]] and his fleet of thirty ships to King [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s cause. His son [[Matthos Seaworth]] encourages him to learn to read so that he can study the holy texts of the [[Lord of Light]] but Davos is happy to put his faith solely in Stannis. [[Melisandre]] seduces [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] with the promise of a son. At first, Stannis hesitates, explaining he has a [[Selyse Baratheon |wife]], but Melisandre still manages to successfully seduce Stannis.

=== On the Iron Islands ===
[[Theon Greyjoy]] travels to the [[Iron Islands]] on a merchant ship and has sex with the [[Captain's daughter]]. He tells her that he is expecting a warm reception and is crushed when there is no one to meet him when he disembarks in [[Lordsport]]. A woman offers him a ride to [[Pyke]] and he attempts to seduce her throughout the journey. He is further disappointed when his father [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] questions his loyalty and his memory of his roots having spent nine years as a ward of [[House Stark]]. He delivers [[Robb Stark]]'s letter suggesting an alliance against [[House Lannister]], for which Robb will make Balon King of the Iron Islands again. His guide enters and he is shocked to realize that she is his sister [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] when Balon greets her warmly. Balon rejects the proposal and compares Theon unfavorably to his sister. He insists that he will follow the [[Ironborn]] tradition of paying the [[Iron price|iron price]] (meaning to take something through force) and says that no one will give him his crown. When Theon warns his father that he will not defeat the Lannisters, Balon retorts that he has no intention of fighting the Lannisters.

===In the Red Waste===
[[File:Daenerys 202.jpg|thumb|190px|Daenerys waits for news]]
[[Daenerys Targaryen]] and her [[khalasar]] lie exhausted in the heat, their water dwindling as they wait for the return of her [[bloodrider]]s. [[Rakharo]]'s horse returns riderless and Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] discovers his head and severed braid in its saddle bag. He surmises that Rakharo was caught and killed by a rival khalasar. [[Irri]] is devastated by the death and believes the mutilation will prevent Rakharo from entering the [[Night Lands]], the [[Dothraki]] land of the dead. Daenerys promises to hold a funeral for Rakharo.

=== At Craster's Keep ===
[[File:Ghostgilly.png|thumb|180x180px|Gilly is cornered by Ghost.]]
[[Samwell Tarly]] rescues one of [[Craster]]'s wives, [[Gilly]], from [[Ghost]] when he bothers her for food. She confides her desire to flee from the keep because of her fear for what Craster will do if her unborn child is a boy. Sam takes her to Jon and she begs him to take her with them on the ranging but will not say what she is afraid of. [[Jon Snow|Jon]] tells Gilly it is not possible for her to come with them because they are going deeper into wildling country. After Gilly leaves, Sam and Jon argue about the impracticality of taking Gilly with them.

Jon notices Craster taking a baby into the woods at night. He follows him and sees him leave the child to the [[White Walkers]]. Jon goes to the child but before he can intervene, Craster surprises him and knocks him out.

'''Janos''': "If you think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf...!”<br />
'''Tyrion''': "'Dwarf?' You should have stopped at 'imp'. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my [[Bronn|friend]] here.

'''Theon''': "I've lived with him, hunted with him, fought at his side. He thinks of me as a brother."<br />
'''Balon''': "No, not here, not in my hearing. You will not name him brother, this son of the man who put your [[Rodrik Greyjoy|true]] [[Maron Greyjoy|brothers]] to the sword. Or have you forgotten your own blood?"<br />
'''Theon''': "I forget nothing. I remember my brothers. And I remember when my father was a king."

<hr width="50%" />'''Balon''': "No man gives me a crown. I pay the [[Iron price]]. I will take my crown, for that is who I am. That is who we have always been."<br />

<hr width="50%" />'''[[Cersei Lannister]]''': "You want to be Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is; lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root, one by one, before they strangle you in your sleep!"<br />
'''Tyrion''': "I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling than that."<br />
'''Cersei''': "I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously; you haven't, Jaime hasn't! It's all fallen on me."<br />
'''Tyrion''': "As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."<br />
'''Cersei''': "You're funny. You've always been funny, but none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? Do you remember, back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death?"<br />
'''Tyrion''': "She was my mother, too."<br />
'''Cersei''': "Mother gone, for the sake of you. There's no bigger joke in the world than that."<br />

<hr width="50%" />'''[[Salladhor Saan]]''': "Cersei. I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I'll fuck this blond queen and I'll fuck her well."<br />
'''[[Matthos Seaworth]]''': "This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the Queen!"<br />
'''Salladhor''': "I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to ''fuck'' her."<br />
'''Matthos''': "As if she would just let you."<br />
'''Salladhor''': "You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck ''you''."<br />

==Behind the scenes==
*The title refers to the [[Night Lands]], the land of the dead in [[Dothraki]] religion. Irri is devastated that Rakharo will not go to the Night Lands because his body was mutilated by his killers without being burned.
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of the [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#Game of Thrones main theme|main theme]]. Though it did not appear in [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|this season]]'s [[Game of Thrones: Season 2 (Music from the HBO Series)|official soundtrack release]], it was in the [[Game of Thrones (Music from the HBO Series)|soundtrack]] for [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]], in which it was titled "Game of Thrones."
*The scene in which Rakharo's severed head is discovered and Irri mourns his death (in a protracted exchange of [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki language]] dialogue) was filmed as part of the next episode, "What is Dead May Never Die." It was moved to this episode in post-production.<ref>[http://www.dothraki.com/2012/04/rhaeshi-ajjalani/] David J. Peterson's blog</ref>
*Tyrion's removal of Janos Slynt is not entirely of his own initiative: in the books, his father Tywin considered it one of Cersei's many follies that she handed out the drastically disproportionate reward of a seat on the Small Council and lordship of Harrenhal to a lowborn and infamously corrupt man like Janos. Thus, Cersei can't overturn the decision to remove him, because Tyrion had explicit orders from Tywin to do so, which also berated Cersei for elevating Janos in the first place. However, it was Tyrion's decision to not only strip him of his title but exile him to the Wall, because he felt he was of questionable loyalty and because he was disgusted that Janos was a baby-killer.
*Both in this episode and in the parallel book chapter, Balon claims that [[Eddard Stark]] killed Theon's brothers. The statement is incorrect: [[Rodrik Greyjoy]] was killed by [[Jason Mallister]] at an [[assault on Seagard]], and [[Maron Greyjoy]] was killed by a collapsing tower during the [[Siege of Pyke]]. Perhaps Balon was speaking loosely out of anger, considering Eddard as generally responsible for the death of his sons, since he was one of the commanders who led the main assault against Pyke at the final stage of the failed rebellion.
*When Theon says "I remember my brothers", his tone of voice does not reveal how he felt about them. In the parallel book chapter, which is told from Theon's POV, he muses how his brothers used to beat him, hence he does not miss them, and does not have any intentions to avenge them.
*A screenshot of Robb's letter to Balon Greyjoy, which he sent Theon to deliver, was posted in the In-Episode Guide for this episode. The visible portions read:
::...House Greyjoy Lord of the...
::...years ago our houses fought as enemies...
::...unite them against a greator foe. Your son has proven himself a formidable warrior and...
::friend of House Stark. Give him command of your fleet to crush the Lannisters and I will give you...
::independence you sought some nine years ago...
::shall be king of the Iron Islands as I am King...
::North, free of the oppression of the [Iron Throne].
::The Lannisters have left their...
::...[Casterly Roc]k largely undefended and...
::Theon speaks for....<ref>[http://www.hbogo.com/#series/video&assetID=GOROSTGP35016?videoMode=embeddedVideo?showSpecialFeatures=true/]</ref>
* The phrasing of Robb's letter to Balon shows that he lacks diplomatic skills: instead of addressing Balon as equal, Robb's words make it sound as if Balon is his subject, and that he is doing Balon a favor by offering him a crown. It is doubtful, though, that a more polite letter would have made Balon react differently, in view of the contempt and resentment he feels toward the Starks.
*As writer [[Bryan Cogman]] explained, the production team wasn't sure in Season 2 if they would eventually be able to include Stannis's daughter [[Shireen Baratheon]] in the TV series. Thus a considerable amount of thought actually went into Melisandre's line in this episode that Stannis has "no ''sons,''" because they wanted to leave their options open to later say that he does have a daughter (and as it turned out, the TV series was ultimately able to introduce Shireen in Season 3):
**"At that point, we honestly didn't know if we would include Shireen or not — we never know how many characters this show can handle so we sometimes hedge one way or the other. So we made it clear that Selyse had given Stannis "no sons," leaving the door open for Shireen if we needed her."<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Season_3_Interview_Bryan_Cogman Westeros.org,] Season 3 Interview: Bryan Cogman.</ref>
*In the episode, the Small Council in King's Landing receives a letter by messenger-raven from the Night's Watch begging for help and warning about the undead [[wight]]s which attacked (which the Small Council doesn't believe). In the books, Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] was actually sent to King's Landing to plead for help in person, but he was ignored and sent back - this is one of the reasons why Ser Alliser doesn't take part in the Great Ranging (and ultimately isn't seen again until Castle Black is seen again in Season 4). Bryan Cogman later explained that the writers did ''intend'' for Ser Alliser to reappear in Season 2 and report to the Small Council in King's Landing just as he did in the novels - however there was a scheduling conflict and actor [[Owen Teale]] was simply unavailable at the time, so it had to be dropped from the scripts.<ref>[https://twitter.com/b_cogman/status/712150561890512896 Cogman Twitter]</ref>
*The captain's daughter refers to the Ironborn as "Iron Islanders." The phrase is used very rarely in the show, and never in the books (in which the ironborn are also called "ironmen").
*Melisadre whispers to Matthos that death by fire is the purest death; this is perhaps a foreshadowing of the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], in which Matthos is burnt alive.
