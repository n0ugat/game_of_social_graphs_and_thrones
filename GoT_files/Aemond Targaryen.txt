{{Quote|Do not mourn me, mother. It was a fair exchange. I may have lost an eye, but I gained a dragon.|Aemond Targaryen|Driftmark (episode)}}
Prince '''Aemond Targaryen''', also known as '''Aemond One-Eye''',{{Ref|HOTD205}} is a [[prince]] of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]], the second son and third child of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and Queen [[Alicent Hightower]]. He is the [[Dragonrider|rider]] of the dragon [[Vhagar]].

After the incapacitation of King [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], Aemond is the leader of the [[Greens]] as [[Prince]] [[Regent]] and [[Protector of the Realm]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==Biography==
===Background ===
Aemond is the thirdborn child and second son of King Viserys by his second wife, Queen Alicent. He is the younger half-brother of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] through his father’s first wife, the late Queen [[Aemma Arryn]], and the full brother of Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], Princess [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]],{{Ref|HOTD106}} and Prince [[Daeron Targaryen]] through his mother.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Aemond accompanies Aegon and [[Lucerys Velaryon]] to the [[Dragonpit]] as [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] is trained to command [[Vermax]]. Aemond is the only boy without a [[dragon]] of his own. The three boys trick Aemond into thinking they found him a dragon, only to present him a pig they dressed up as one, mockingly proclaiming it the "Pink Dread." Aemond descends into the tunnels of the pit, where he finds [[Dreamfyre]]. When Dreamfyre roars and breathes fire, however, a frightened Aemond is knocked back and runs away. Aemond tells his mother of the incident while Helaena overhears. Alicent later reprimands Aegon, who calls Aemond a twat. Aemond later trains in arms with Aegon, Jace, and Luke in the courtyard of the [[Red Keep]] under Ser [[Criston Cole]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Aemond attends the funeral of his aunt, [[Laena Velaryon]], on [[Driftmark]]. He and his brother watch their sister Helaena study a spider, and they argue over Aegon's betrothal to and dislike of their sister. Aemond defends Helaena by reminding Aegon she is their sister and his future Queen. When Aegon suggests Aemond should marry Helaena if he's willing to defend her, Aemond says that if he were betrothed to Helaena, he would do his duty to keep their Valyrian blood pure. Later, Aemond approaches Jace, Baela, and Rhaena who are all mourning a parent. A long look is exchanged, but nothing is said.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

[[File:Young Aemond Targaryen.png|thumb|left|250px|Aemond commanding Vhagar.]]
That night, when his grandfather [[Otto Hightower]] drags off a drunken Aegon to put him to bed, Aemond decides to achieve his dream of claiming a dragon to prove himself. He sneaks away from his family and finds [[Vhagar]] sleeping on the beach. When he approaches her and tries to climb her, she wakes up. Vhagar goes back to sleep once Aemond backs away, but when the boy tries again, an angered Vhagar almost burns him alive. He successfully bonds with her by commanding her to calm herself and serve him in [[High Valyrian]]. He then climbs on her back, but neglects to fasten himself to the saddle before commanding her to fly, almost falling to his death as Vhagar soars into the sky. Nevertheless, he quickly gets the hang of it and rides the dragon around [[High Tide]] before landing.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

When he returns to the castle, Aemond is confronted by Jace and Luke, as well as Laena's daughters, [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]]. Rhaena says that she was entitled to Vhagar as Laena's daughter, but Aemond, taken over by a rush of ego and pride, tells her to go claim a pig instead, as it would fit her. The two fight, but Aemond throws Rhaena to the ground. Baela punches him, but Aemond strikes back and threatens to feed Baela to Vhagar if she comes at him again. This prompts Jace to enter the fray, followed by Luke. Both are knocked down, with Luke's nose being broken. Jace manages to push Aemond to the ground, and he, Baela, and Rhaena begin to pummel Aemond. Aemond manages to escape before grabbing Luke by the throat and brandishing a rock to hit him with, cruelly saying that Luke will die screaming on fire just like his father [[Harwin Strong]], calling Luke and Jace [[bastard]]s. When Luke says that his father, [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]], is still alive, Aemond taunts Jace about Luke not knowing his true parentage, calling him "Lord [[House Strong|Strong]]." This prompts Jace to unsheathe a knife and attack him, but Aemond dodges him before hitting him in the head with the rock. As Aemond prepares to strike Jace again, Jace blinds him with sand before Luke grabs the dropped knife and slashes Aemond in the left eye. As Aemond wails in pain, the Kingsguard, attracted by the commotion, find the children. As [[Harrold Westerling]] orders the children to cease fighting and turns Aemond over to see his injury, he is shocked by what he sees.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

[[File:DM Aemond Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aemond after losing an eye.]]
The children are brought to the [[Hall of Nine]], where King Viserys angrily demands to know from his Kingsguard how this happened, while Aemond's eye is tended to by [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Kelvyn]] as Corlys, Rhaenys, Rhaenyra, and Daemon enter asking what happened. Aemond accuses Jace and Luke of attacking him unprovoked, but an argument soon breaks out amongst the involved children, sans Aegon and Helaena, screaming at and over each other before Viserys silences them. The king questions Aemond, who is defended by his mother. When Jace says that Aemond called them bastards, Viserys demands that Aemond reveals where he heard the rumor. Aemond eyes his mother, but reluctantly says he heard it from Aegon. Initially taken aback, Aegon, when pressed by Viserys, says that it is obvious that Jace and Luke are bastards based simply on their non-Valyrian appearance.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

When Viserys demands that peace be made within the family and that anyone who questions the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's sons will have their tongue removed, Alicent says that is not enough, and demands the eye of one of Rhaenyra's sons in return. When Viserys refuses, Alicent then demands that Ser Criston take one of Lucerys's eyes, claiming that she will let him decide which eye to keep, a privilege not rewarded to Aemond, but Criston remains still. The situation escalates dramatically when Alicent grabs Viserys's [[Valyrian steel dagger]] to do it herself. Aemond remains seated for most of the confrontation between Alicent and Rhaenyra when she moves to defend Luke. When the two are separated, Aemond tells Alicent not to mourn him, as he gained a dragon, and considers it a fair exchange for his eye.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

The next day, Aemond rides Vhagar back to King's Landing alongside Aegon on [[Sunfyre]] and Helaena on [[Dreamfyre]].{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Six years later, Aemond spars with Criston in the training yard. Although Criston initially has the upper hand, Aemond is able to defeat him. Criston compliments him by saying that he will be winning [[tournament]]s in no time, to which Aemond replies "I don't give a shit about tourneys." He then notices his nephews Jace and Luke, and asks them if they have come to train.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Aemond is later present when [[Vaemond Velaryon]] petitions the crown to name him heir to Driftmark. He appears to be amused throughout the proceeding, especially so when Vaemond loudly declares the bastardy of Jace, Luke, and [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joff]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

At supper, Aemond is served a roast pig, causing Luke to laugh at him in remembrance of the prank that he, Jace, and Aegon played on him. In response, Aemond stands up and raises a toast to his nephews, in which he taunts them about how "strong" they are. A brawl erupts at this, ending with [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] exchanging a challenging look with Aemond, causing the latter to back down.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[File:TGC Aemond Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aemond looking for Aegon.]]
Following the death of his father Viserys, the [[Green Council]] proclaims Aegon the rightful heir, bypassing Rhaenyra's long-established claim on flimsy circumstances. Aegon seems to have disappeared from the Red Keep, so his grandfather Otto sends the brothers [[Arryk Cargyll|Arryk]] and [[Erryk Cargyll]] to find him. Alicent also wants her son on the throne but disapproves of her father's aggressive approach; she believes that openly antagonizing Rhaenyra would be a foolish idea, so she covertly sends Aemond and Ser Criston to find Aegon before the Cargyll brothers do. Aemond takes Criston to a brothel on the Street of Silk where Aegon once took him to loose his virginity, in the hope that he might be sheltering there, but the madam claims that she has not seen him, though she does privately admit to Aemond that she misses the younger prince's patronage.{{Ref|HOTD109}} He is present at his brother's coronation in the Dragonpit; when [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and [[Meleys]] attack the ceremony, Aemond moves to protect his sister Helaena.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TBQ Aemond and Borros Still.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aemond at [[Storm's End]].]]
Following Aegon's coronation, Aemond is sent to [[Storm's End]] to convince [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]] to support the Greens. He wins Lord [[Borros Baratheon]]'s allegiance in return for agreeing to wed Borros's daughter [[Floris Baratheon|Floris,]]  and is present when [[Lucerys Velaryon]] arrives to try and claim House Baratheon's support for the Blacks. After Borros rebuffs Lucerys, Aemond demands Lucerys put out one of his eyes as compensation for the eye Lucerys took from him at Driftmark. When Lucerys refuses, Aemond snarls that Lucerys is both a craven and a traitor, draws a blade and tries to attack Luke; Lord Borros intervenes, refusing to let Aemond violate [[guest right]] by maiming Lucerys, an envoy, beneath his roof and has his guards escort Lucerys back to [[Arrax|his dragon]] while Aemond glares at his nephew.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

Shortly after, Aemond mounts Vhagar and pursues the departing Lucerys and Arrax, using his larger dragon to terrorize the pair. Unfortunately, the situation escalates when a panicking Arrax blasts Vhagar in the face with fire. Aemond, recognizing the situation is spiraling out of control, desperately tries to calm the enraged Vhagar but to no avail, and he is helpless to stop his dragon from killing Lucerys and Arrax. He watches in horror as Arrax's mutilated remains fall to earth, aware he's unintentionally become a [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]], destroyed any possibility of Rhaenyra accepting a peaceful resolution to the succession crisis, and guaranteed the Blacks will declare war in retaliation.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Aemond and Vhagar return to [[King's Landing]], initially causing a panic amongst the [[Red Keep]]'s garrison, commanded by Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]], who aim [[scorpion]]s skyward until they confirm the approaching dragon is Vhagar.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

The [[Green Council]] briefly discusses Aemond's marriage pact with Lady [[Floris Baratheon]], citing that it has won them the allegiance of Lord [[Borros Baratheon]] and the [[Stormlands]]. Aemond then barges into the Council meeting; when his mother, who is still furious at him for destroying their diplomatic efforts by killing Lucerys, points out he has no seat on the Council, King Aegon announces that he invited Aemond to attend. Aemond consults a wall-mounted map of [[Westeros]], noting that the path to King's Landing passes through the Riverlands, and recommends seizing [[Harrenhal]] as a base of operations before the [[Blacks]] do. Aegon proposes that he and Aemond fly to [[Riverrun]], force Lord [[Grover Tully]] to capitulate and destroy the [[Velaryon fleet]]'s [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]] of the [[Gullet]] along the way, only to be overruled by Alicent, who insists Vhagar and Aemond are needed to defend King's Landing against a potential retaliatory attack from Rhaenyra for Lucerys's murder, glaring at her younger son as she says so, since his actions have made such a possibility likelier.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

A grieving [[Rhaenyra]] declares to the [[Black Council]] that she wants Aemond to die for his murder of her son. Prince [[Daemon]] sneaks into King's Landing to arrange it, hiring a pair of his former lover [[Mysaria]]'s agents ([[Blood]] and [[Cheese]]) to carry out the killing, though he gives them leave to target another prince of the royal family should they be unable to find Aemond or consider him beyond them.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

[[File:S2 Aemond Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aemond discussing war plans with [[Criston Cole|Criston]].]]
In his chambers in the Red Keep, Aemond drinks with [[Criston Cole]], complaining that his mother is blaming his killing of Lucerys for starting the war, when it was her decision to flout his [[Viserys I Targaryen|father's]] wishes and have Aegon usurp the throne that prompted Rhaenyra to call her banners in retaliation. Aemond also proposes that they should march through the [[Crownlands]], adding the levies of the local lords to their own army as they march to Harrenhal. Otto Hightower arrives and, after dismissing Criston, annoyedly tells Aemond he needs to show patience and restraint in the coming campaigns.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Blood and Cheese find Aemond's apartments soon after, but by that point he has left. With time running out, and not wanting to return to Daemon empty handed, they settle for [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|killing Aemond's nephew]], Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]]. {{Ref|HOTD201}} Aemond eventually learns that he was the target of the assassination attempt; in a private conversation with his mistress [[Sylvi]] at her brothel, he expresses pride that Daemon seemingly fears him enough to try and kill Aemond in his bed rather than face him on the battlefield, as well as admitting his regret for the part he played in Luke's death.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

In the following days, Aemond attends a meeting of the Green Council where he reveals that the Green-aligned [[House Bracken]] have attacked the Black-aligned [[House Blackwood]] in the Riverlands, culminating in the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]]. When Criston Cole announces his intention to march through the Crownlands, suppress the Black-loyal houses there and march their levies through the Riverlands to seize control of Harrenhal, Aegon asks if Cole will take Aemond and Vhagar with him. The pair exchange a look, after which Cole insists Aemond will remain in King's Landing to defend the city. When Aegon volunteers himself and his own dragon [[Sunfyre]] to accompany the march, Aemond is amongst those to talk the king down, insisting they cannot risk the King's loss, much to Aegon's displeasure. Aemond, while paying another visit to Sylvi's brothel that evening, is accosted by Aegon (who had been told by Lord Larys Strong of rumours Aemond and their mother were trying to encourage him to march out so they could rule King's Landing in his stead), who torments his younger brother for still bedding the first woman he slept with, prompting an angered Aemond to storm out.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

[[File:2x4 Aemond Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aemond on the Green Council.]]
At a meeting of the Green Council, Aegon angrily admonishes Lord Larys Strong for allowing [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] to take over Harrenhal nearly unopposed, though Larys calmly states that the castle is in tatters and will likely drive Daemon to madness trying to repair it sufficiently to garrison an army, while all of the gold of House Strong lies safely within his hands. Prince Aemond Targaryen suddenly interjects, announcing that [[Harrenhal]] will have to wait, because Ser Criston marches on Rook's Rest, the seat of Black-aligned House Staunton. Aegon realizes his younger brother has been conducting war strategy without his authority, but is unable to provide a response when Aemond addresses him in High Valyrian, as he struggles to form a sentence in the language. With the rest of the Small Council silently in agreement with Aemond, the course of the war is set.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Green army begin marching out of their encampment in the nearby forest to assault Rook's Rest, deploying multiple siege weapons and hundreds of infantry. Ser Criston has the levies of Houses Rosby, Stokeworth, and Darklyn move forward while keeping the forces of House Targaryen and House Hightower in reserve. As they advance forward, Criston's army is met with heavy resistance from the Staunton garrison, who begin subjecting the attackers to multiple arrow volleys.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Their advance is halted when [[Meleys]] is spotted in the air, forcing the Greens to retreat back to the treeline. [[Gwayne Hightower|Gwayne]] admonishes Criston that this is the exact reason he opposed a daytime attack, but Criston reveals this is part of his plan, ordering two of his archers to launch signal arrows. This alerts a series of soldiers deeper in the forest to blow horns that finally reach Aemond, signaling for him and Vhagar to enter the battle. At that same moment, Aegon flies overhead atop [[Sunfyre]], having departed King's Landing earlier to personally join the battle, much to Aemond's fury, who subsequently stalls his own entry into the fray.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Suddenly, Lord Simon and the Staunton garrison see Vhagar's enormous body emerge from the treeline, much to the relief and awe of Criston and the Green army. As Meleys continues to assault Sunfyre, Rhaenys and Aegon both spot Aemond and Vhagar advancing on them. Initially relieved at his brother's intervention, Aegon becomes horrified as he realizes Aemond intends to attack both of them as Vhagar unleashes a blast of dragonfire. Rhaenys and Meleys manage to dodge the bulk of the blast, but Aegon and Sunfyre are struck head-on. Heavily injured, Sunfyre and Aegon freefall from a high-altitude, crashing into the nearby forest with great force, much to Criston's horror, who rides off to the impact site.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

With Rhaenys and Meleys largely unharmed from Vhagar's attack and with Aegon and Sunfyre now incapacitated, the two fly seaward away from Rook's Rest. Despite being at a severe disadvantage against Aemond and the much larger Vhagar and with the opportunity to escape to safety, Rhaenys resolves to return to the battle instead. As Rhaenys circles back, Aemond spots Meleys as he flies over his brother's crash site and has Vhagar turn around to confront her. As the two dragons become entangled, both blasting one another with dragonfire, they also begin to fall out of the sky, sparking panic amongst the Green army on the ground. As Criston's army attempts to flee, Meleys breaks loose just above the ground and flies off, while Vhagar crashes into the battlefield violently, crushing dozens, if not, hundreds of men in the process, and knocking Criston unconscious from the impact.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Undeterred, Aemond and Vhagar swiftly recover, with Vhagar crushing more fleeing Green soldiers underfoot as she takes flight once again. Meanwhile, Rhaenys and Meleys, both exhausted and injured from the battle, prepare to depart back to Dragonstone. Rhaenys attempts to locate Vhagar both on the ground and in the air to no avail. As they fly over Rook's Rest, however, they are suddenly attacked from below by Vhagar, much in the same way as it was with Prince Lucerys Velaryon and Arrax. With Vhagar's massive jaws crushing down on Meleys's neck, both Rhaenys and Meleys struggle in vain to break free as Vhagar drags them skyward. Ultimately, Vhagar proves too strong, fatally crushing Meleys's neck in her jaws, with Meleys giving Rhaenys one last look before succumbing to her injuries. Vhagar then releases Meleys, with Rhaenys resigned to the same fate as her dragon as the two plummet from the sky, violently crashing into the walls of Rook's Rest as a blast of fire erupts from Meleys's body.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

[[File:2x4 Aemond Targaryen Still 4.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aemond points at Aegon and Sunfyre.]]
Sometime after Rhaenys and Meleys's death, Criston eventually arrives at Aegon's crash site in the forest, spotting both a severely injured Sunfyre and Aemond approaching with his sword unsheathed. As Criston inquires on Aegon's location, Aemond wordlessly points forward with Aegon's valyrian steel dagger revealing his motionless, shattered body with Sunfyre curled around him. Speechless, Criston collapses to his knees in shock as Aemond departs.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Aegon has survived but is comatose and severely wounded, while Sunfyre is not expected to survive. Aemond has taken [[Blackfyre]] for himself which Alicent notices. Criston withholds telling Alicent what part Aemond played in the battle. Alicent nominates herself as regent, citing her experience, but the council instead elect Aemond, primarily due to his sex, saying that the choice demonstrates strength. Aemond orders the city gates shut just as masses of citizens, including blacksmith Hugh and his family, attempt to flee. Later, Helaena confronts Aemond in front of the Iron Throne, asking if it was worth the price.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

[[File:2x6 Aemond Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aemond acting as regent.]]
At a meeting of the Green Council, Aemond, having received Lord Jason's summons, furiously erupts at Tyland Lannister over his twin brother's arrogant audacity to summon him like a servant. Tyland attempts to defend his brother's decision by reminding Aemond of [[Caraxes]] presence at Harrenhal (against whom the Lannister host would be defenseless should Daemon fly out to intercept them), but Aemond angrily orders Tyland to write back commanding Jason to march into the Riverlands, threatening Caraxes will become the least of Jason's problems if he disobeys.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Alicent tries to calm her son down, but Aemond talks over her, instructing Tyland to sail across the Narrow Sea and negotiate with the Triarchy for naval power to break the blockade of the Gullet. The rest of the Small Council are aghast at this; Tyland and Criston Cole protest the dangers of allowing Triarchy military forces, whom they consider little better than pirates, so close to Westerosi waters, but Aemond is adamant, arguing that it will take the fleets of Houses Lannister and Hightower too long to sail around Westeros, whereas the Triarchy's fleets are much closer and would surely relish the opportunity to avenge their previous defeats at [[Corlys Velaryon]]'s hands. Alicent, reminding Aemond the bloody battles fought in the Stepstones against the Triarchy during his father's reign prove their untrustworthiness, proposes an alliance with the ironborn as an alternative way to gain naval power, but Orwyle admits all his ravens to Dalton Greyjoy have gone unanswered.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Aemond also orders Criston to muster their forces and march against Harrenhal. Criston protests, arguing that their army is so depleted by the casualties sustained at the Battle at Rook's Rest that if Daemon succeeds in rallying the Riverlords to his banner, Criston can't be sure of defeating him, urging they should wait until House Hightower's armies can arrive to reinforce them. Aemond overrules him, as it will take two weeks to march to Harrenhal and the longer they wait, the greater the risk Daemon will raise an army against them; Aemond assures Criston that once he and Jason have forced Daemon to fight on two fronts, he will fly out with Vhagar to join them and put an end to Daemon.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

As the meeting adjourns, Aemond requests Alicent wait a moment. As she begins rebuking him for his brash conduct, Aemond talks over her again, asking what her actual position on the Small Council is. Alicent reminds him she ruled in his father's stead while Viserys's health declined, and has counselled Aegon, but Aemond insists that his father is dead, his brother is likely soon to be dead, and he has no further use of her, and removes her from the Small Council. Alicent insists she is needed on the council to provide a tempering voice, but Aemond scoffs he has too many of those already, snidely remarking Alicent should be happy she's free to return to more "domestic pursuits." Shaken by her son's newfound hostility towards her, Alicent cups Aemond's cheek, asking if he hasn't by now avenged the indignities of his childhood (Aegon's bullying, the loss of his eye to Lucerys), but Aemond pulls away from his mother, dismissively thanks her for her service to the Crown and leaves.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

[[File:2x7 Aemond Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Aemond with [[Blackfyre]] in the courtyard.]]
In the courtyard, Larys observes as Aemond sentences the two Kingsguard knights [[Martyn Reyne]] and [[Eddard Waters]] to lifetime servitude at the [[Wall]], ostensibly for fomenting the riots. Lord Jasper Wylde approaches Larys and says that [[Seasmoke]] has a new, unknown rider. Considering it an unverified rumor, Larys suggests they withhold telling Aemond.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

During a council meeting, Lord Jasper informs Aemond that Prince [[Daeron Targaryen]] and his dragon [[Tessarion]] are nearly ready to join the war. The meeting is interrupted by a loud commotion outside: [[Ulf]] flying on [[Silverwing]] above the city. Aemond rushes out to mount Vhagar and pursues them to Dragonstone. He quickly retreats, however, upon seeing Rhaenyra with [[Syrax]], [[Vermithor]], and Silverwing, all adult dragons now claimed by riders.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

Aemond burns [[Sharp Point]] with Vhagar in anger after his retreat from Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

Back in King's Landing, Aemond demands that Helaena ride her dragon, [[Dreamfyre]], into battle. When she refuses, Aemond furiously manhandles Helaena, but Alicent intervenes, berating Aemond for being reckless and destructive. Later, Aemond tries gently persuading Helaena, but she again declines, revealing she knows he burnt Aegon and Sunfyre at Rook's Rest. She also says she has foreseen his death in the war and Aegon retaking the throne, and insists killing her, as Aemond threatens to in a moment of anger, will change nothing.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|'Tis I the younger brother who studies history and philosophy, it is I who trains with the sword, who rides the largest dragon in the world. It is I who should be...|Aemond, to Criston Cole, before Aegon's coronation|The Green Council}}
Tall, proud, and vengeful, Aemond is a fearsome and serious man, with intelligence and discipline to match. Known for his serious disposition and fiery internal drive, Aemond has shown himself to be among the most learned men in his family, and a warrior on par with the Kingsguard. Despite his considerable skill at arms,{{Guideref|Aemond Targaryen}} he has no interest in tournaments or showing off.{{Ref|HOTD108}} As a child, he was petulant and conniving, though also brave, some may have said foolhardy.{{Guideref|Aemond Targaryen}} Bullied in his youth by his brother and nephews for lacking a dragon of his own, Aemond cloaked himself with a stoic and serious demeanour, and let their insults fuel his drive to prove himself. He has a vendetta against his nephews Luke and Jace due to their childhood fight in which he lost his left eye. While vengeful, he considers the loss a worthwhile trade as he gained Vhagar, the largest living dragon, in exchange, despite his mother's hysterics.

Aemond has the strong desire of becoming the new heir and succeed his father as king. He envies his older brother Aegon, believing himself more capable of ruling, as he is the one who studies history and philosophy, trains at arms, and rides the largest dragon in Westeros, while Aegon drinks, chases serving girls, and spends most of his time outside of the castle, but still is the heir as the king's firstborn son.{{Ref|HOTD109}} Aemond is also intelligent, being the first to realize the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murder of his nephew]] was actually an attempt directed to himself and that was orchestrated by [[Daemon Targaryen]], making him feel guilty for the loss of Jaehaerys because he is aware it started when he did the same with Lucerys. Despite being a fierce, stoic young man, Aemond does actually possess a vulnerable side but hides it from everyone else, except with [[Sylvi]], a prostitute he has come to form a bond with who acts more like a mother figure to him.{{Ref|HOTD202}}  

It has been indirectly stated that Aemond wants to kill his brother Aegon to claim the throne. However, he is also loyal to him because they are of the same blood and is his closest kin. Despite this, Aemond is not above showing contempt and disdain for his brother, and openly shows it whenever he has the opportunity.{{Ref|HOTD204}} Contrary to Aegon, he is rational, pragmatic and a skilled strategist with a keen mind for battle, while his brother remains emotional and often incompetent due to his lack of discipline or willingness to learn.  There is still bad blood between the brothers as they have traded insults with each other, though Aemond often comes out ahead due to his intelligence and patience.

Aemond has shown to be far more suited to the role of king compared to his brother. He acts decisively, recognizes the strengths of his enemies and allies, and is a pragmatic and levelheaded leader. He removed his own mother from the [[Green Council]] knowing that, despite being the Queen Dowager, as a woman the council wouldn't listen to her advices for war, gave the command to search for his grandsire [[Otto Hightower]] to bring him back to serve once again as the Lord Hand.{{Ref|HOTD206}} Despite his lack of respect for his brother, Aemond can show respect to certain people due to specific traits, such as Criston Cole for his decency with no taste for depravity,{{Ref|HOTD109}} his uncle Daemon for being a man quick to act and respond,{{Ref|HOTD108}} feeling proud that he considers him a threat,{{Ref|HOTD202}} and Otto Hightower because of his loyalty to their house.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Despite his competency and intelligence, Aemond is also vengeful, cruel, and quarrelsome, much like his uncle, Daemon. He is more diplomatic than Daemon, but has shown that he never forgets a slight, and is willing to abuse and force people to do what he wants, and seems to throw tantrums whenever he loses. His temper is fearsome when roused to wroth, and few can brave the storm that comes with it. He has never forgiven Lucerys for putting out his eye, and told Luke to put out one of his own to settle their debt or Aemond would have his life in return. Close family is not above his wroth either, as he also threatened his sister with abuse and death when she would not do his bidding.

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Aemond was the second son of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and the brother of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] and Daeron Targaryen. His personal mount was the dragon Vhagar, who had become the largest of the dragons after the death of Balerion.

In ''Fire & Blood'', while he fought against Princes Jacaerys and Lucerys on Driftmark, he lost his right eye, not his left eye. For this he gained the epithet "Aemond One-Eye." The killing of Lucerys (which he was proud of) earned him the derogatory nickname "Aemond the Kinslayer".
