{{Quote|It's a sad fuckin' statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance.|Loyal [[Night's Watch]] man|The Red Woman}}
A '''loyal Night's Watch man''' finds [[Davos Seaworth]] standing above [[Jon Snow]]'s lifeless body in the courtyard.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
After the [[Mutiny at Castle Black]] takes place, he along with [[Eddison Tollett]] and two others find [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] standing above Jon's lifeless body in the courtyard. Together, they move the body to the Lord Commander's quarters and barricade the door, after realizing that [[Alliser Thorne]] was behind the mutiny. Edd goes to find [[Tormund]] and the wildlings to help them against Thorne and his men, while he, Davos, [[Ghost]] and the rest guard Jon's body.{{Ref|GOT601}}

Later, the group is approached by Thorne, who by then has the entire Night's Watch backing him up. He offers the loyal Night Watch's men immunity and safe passage for Davos and Melissandre to the South if they surrender. They are not swayed by Throne's words, knowing he will kill them all the moment they open the door. Davos manages to buy sometime by promising Thorne an answer by nightfall.{{Ref|GOT601}}

At nightfall, Thorne comes back and with Edd nowhere to be seen, the loyalist prepare to attack the mutineers as they break their way in. Before the skirmish commences Edd and Tormund arrive in time to end the struggle and place Thorne and the mutineers under arrest, saving the loyalists.{{Ref|GOT602}}
