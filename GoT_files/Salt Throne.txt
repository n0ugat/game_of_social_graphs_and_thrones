The '''Salt Throne''',{{Ref|GOT602}} also known as the '''Seastone Chair''',{{Ref|H&L802}} ​is an ancient throne of the [[Iron Islands]], sat upon by the [[King of the Iron Islands|Kings of the Iron Islands]].<ref>"[[Greyjoy Rebellion - Theon Greyjoy]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Seastone Chair is located on a dais, in the Great Hall of the Great Keep on [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]]. It is made of a block of oily [[black stone]] carved into the shape of a kraken. The legend says that it was found by the [[First Men]] on the shores of [[Old Wyk]] when they came to the Iron Islands.

Although the term "Seastone Chair" is used in the books, the TV series generally prefers "Salt Throne," particularly when used as metonymically to refer to the kingship of the Iron Islands.
