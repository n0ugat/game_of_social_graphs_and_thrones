{{Quote|My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him.|Olenna Tyrell|Dark Wings, Dark Words}}
Lord '''Luthor Tyrell''' was the father of [[Mace Tyrell]], the [[Lord of Highgarden]] and the head of [[House Tyrell]]. He was survived by his widow, [[Olenna Tyrell]].

==Biography==
===Background===
In his youth, Luthor was expected to marry [[Viola Redwyne]]. The night before he was due to propose to her, however, Viola's sister Olenna "stumbled" upon his bedchamber after allegedly getting lost after her embroidery lesson. The next morning, Luthor did not propose to Viola; in fact, he never left his chamber, as he couldn't walk, and could only think of what Olenna had given him the night before.{{Ref|GOT404}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Lord Luthor's widow, Lady Olenna, describes her late husband to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] as "an oaf". She explains that her husband died when he rode over a cliff while hawking. He had been looking up and not paying attention to where his horse was going. She used the incident as a metaphor for the Tyrells' alliance with the Lannisters.{{Ref|GOT302}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is [[Purple Wedding|poisoned and dies]] right in front of [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]], she is left somewhat shaken. Days later, wearing mourning clothes, Olenna recalls to her that Luthor was an oaf she had to sit through boring banquets with and produce heirs with - but it was still horrifying after he died in his hunting accident, when they brought him back and she saw his lifeless corpse laid out on a table. Olenna seems uncharacteristically a little upset, though she tries to hide it, as she clearly didn't ''rejoice'' when Luthor died.{{Ref|GOT403}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Luthor Tyrell's backstory remains the same, except that it was planned for him to marry Shaera Targaryen, a member of [[House Targaryen]], who was cut out in the show to simplify the Targaryen dynasty, and not another Redwyne.

After a short conversation with Olenna, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] wonders if Luthor deliberately rode off that cliff.
