{{Quote|Without the Street of Flour, the king would have no bread.|[[Varys]]|King's Landing (short)}}
The '''Street of Flour'''{{Ref|GOT310}} is a street in [[King's Landing]] known for its bakeries.<ref>"[[King's Landing (short)|King's Landing]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Street of Flour is also known for its bakeries. A maze of twisting alleys and cross streets lie below the street.

In ''A Game of Thrones'', [[Arya Stark|Arya]] visits the Street of Flour during her time in King's Landing, catching a pigeon and enjoying the scent of perfume coming from the bakeries.

In ''A Clash of Kings'', upon arriving there to serve as [[Hand of the King]] in [[Tywin Lannister|his father]]'s absence, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] notices guards stationed at every shop door. He realizes that food must be on short supply in the capital due to [[House Tyrell]] cutting off the commerce coming from the [[Roseroad]], and that the situation must be truly grave if the bakers find [[Mercenary|sellswords]] cheaper than bread.
