'''Casey Michaels''' is an English stuntwoman. A third-generation stunt performer, her mother [[w:c:starwars:Tracey Eddon|Tracey Eddon]] was Carrier Fisher's body double in ''Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi''.

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', she portrayed a Child of the Forest in the episode "[[The Door]]".

She was also a stunt performer in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|sixth season]] episodes "[[The Red Woman]]", "[[Home]]", "[[Oathbreaker]]", "[[Book of the Stranger]]", "[[The Door]]", "[[The Broken Man]]" and "[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]", the [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|seventh season]] episode "[[Stormborn]]" and the [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|eighth season]] episodes "[[The Long Night]]" and "[[The Bells]]".

In January 2021, Michaels sued Fire & Blood Productions for almost $5,000,000 over an injury. During the filming of "The Long Night", she suffered a "serious fracture dislocation to her left ankle" after being instructed to walk off a roof that was approximately 12 feet high, "as if unaware of the drop, in keeping with the zombie-like nature of the wights," falling onto a box rig below which Michaels alleges was not durable enough to cushion the fall of all 28 stunt performers. She has been unable to work since the incident. The case is likely to be heard before a judge in the summer of 2022.<ref>https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/game-of-thrones-stunt-performer-suing-1235262955/</ref>
