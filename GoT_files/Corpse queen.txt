{{Quote|For thirteen years, he and his queen ruled over his brothers, making sacrifices as black as their cloaks.|[[Ygritte]]|The Night's Watch}}
[[Night's King]]'s '''corpse queen'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a legendary figure known both in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and among the [[Free Folk]] dwelling [[Beyond the Wall]]. She allegedly lived not long after the creation of the [[Night's Watch]], some 8,000 years ago.

==Biography==
[[File:Night's_Queen_death.png|thumb|The death of the corpse queen at the hands of [[Brandon Stark (Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]].]]
According to legend, a [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]] found in the [[Haunted Forest]] a cold woman with bright blue eyes, seemingly a female [[White Walkers|White Walker]]. He took her to the other side of the [[Wall]] and declared himself "Night's King". For thirteen years the two ruled over the brothers of the Night's Watch, performing human sacrifices. The Free Folk rallied under the banner of a [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], [[Joramun]], and marched against the [[Nightfort]], which Night's King had taken as his seat, [[Fall of Night's King|defeating him]] and his queen with the aid of [[House Stark]].{{Ref|H&L212}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Night's King fell in love with a woman "with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars"; he loved her though "her skin was cold as ice", and when he gave his seed to her he gave her his soul as well. He brought her to the Nightfort and bound the brothers of the Night's Watch to his will through sorcery. He declared himself "Night's King" and ruled over the Wall and the [[Gift]] as his own. The [[King in the North]] [[Brandon Stark (Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]] and [[Joramun]], the King-Beyond-the-Wall, joined forces to defeat him and his queen.

After their deaths, it was discovered that they had been making human sacrifices to the Others - the [[White Walkers]].

After their defeat, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the Wall should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of Night's King his corpse queen also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not "rule" the Wall but who serve the realms of men.
