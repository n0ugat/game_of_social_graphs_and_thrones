'''Whispering Wood'''{{Ref|GOT210}} is a forest in the [[Riverlands]], located northwest of [[Riverrun]] along the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
The [[Battle of Whispering Wood]] occurred here, during which [[Robb Stark]] lured [[Jaime Lannister]]'s army into a trap and annihilated it, capturing the Kingslayer himself, thus lifting Jaime's siege of Riverrun.<ref>"[[Baelor]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels the Whispering Wood is northwest of Riverrun. It is named for the whispers of Robb Stark's army as they waited for Jaime Lannister.

The first season HBO viewers guide showed the Whispering Wood to the north-west of Riverrun. The second season map, however, positions it east of [[Seagard]]. The initial [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]] viewer's guide map seems to have been in error, because the HBO Viewer's Guide "Battleground [[Westeros]]" feature released later in Season 2 positioned Whispering Wood as immediately north-west of Riverrun, as in the books.
