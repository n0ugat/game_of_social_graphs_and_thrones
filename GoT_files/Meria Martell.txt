Princess '''Meria Martell '''was the [[Prince of Dorne|Princess of Dorne]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]].

==Biography==
[[File:Rhaenys and Meria.png|thumb|Princess Meria defies Queen [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]]]]
Meria Martell was the [[Prince of Dorne|Princess of Dorne]] before and during [[Aegon's Conquest]]. When [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]] went to [[Sunspear]] to demand [[Dorne]]'s surrender to Targaryen rule, Meria turned her away with a warning not to return. Rhaenys did not heed this warning and this led to the [[First Dornish War]], in which the Targaryens attempted to subdue Dorne the same way they had defeated the armies of [[House Lannister]] and [[House Gardener]] in the [[Field of Fire]]. Rhaenys, her dragon [[Meraxes]] and all of her soldiers were killed, and Aegon never attempted to conquer Dorne again.{{Ref|H&L509}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Meria was around eighty years old, fat, blind and almost bald when [[Aegon's Conquest]] took place. She was called the "Yellow Toad of Dorne" by the [[Storm King]] [[Argilac Durrandon]].

When he began his Conquest, [[Aegon I Targaryen]] sent [[raven]]s to all of the rulers of [[Westeros]] demanding that they yield to him as the sole king of the realm and be rewarded or be destroyed. Meria replied that she would help him defeat the Storm King, but would not yield to him.

[[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]] led the invasion of [[Dorne]] during the Conquest, and the [[Dornishmen]] refused to give battle but instead launched guerilla raids on Rhaenyra's forces before retreating into the mountains and deserts. The men deserted the Dornish keeps and when Rhaenys asked the women and children where they had gone, they simply replied ''"away"''. Rhaenys then flew to [[Sunspear]] on her [[dragon]] [[Meraxes]] and met Princess Meria alone, demanding that Dorne surrender to Targaryen rule. Meria replied that Dorne would never surrender and warned Rhaenys not to return, and the Targaryen army left without conquering Dorne.

Aegon launched a new campaign against Dorne which lasted many years, the [[First Dornish War]], in 4 AC. Meria and the other Dornish lords abandoned their keeps, and the Targaryens found Sunspear empty and declared themselves victorious. They placed Lord Rosby and Lord [[Harlen Tyrell]] in charge of the city before returning to [[King's Landing]]. The Dornish then attacked the city and retook the castle, and Meria had Lord Rosby forced to the top of the Spear Tower, where she personally threw him from the window. Lord Tyrell attempted to retake Sunspear from her forces by setting out from [[Hellholt]] take the [[Vaith]], but he vanished in the Dornish deserts and was never seen again.

Meria continued to resist the Targaryens until she died in 13 AC and was succeeded by her son Prince [[Nymor Martell|Nymor]], who immediately began negotiating peace. Though Meria was triumphant in resisting House Targaryen in the final years of her life, however, her guerrilla tactics were looked down on by the realm as cowardice. Meria soon became a controversial figure in Westerosi history, who is mostly cast in a negative light by many as of the present.
