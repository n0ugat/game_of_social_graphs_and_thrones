'''House Mallister'''{{Ref|HOTD102}} of [[Seagard]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. Their lands are north of Riverrun, along the west coast of the [[Riverlands]] on [[Ironman's Bay]] and southwest of the [[Twins]]. The castle, Seagard, is near the headwaters of the [[Blue Fork]] of the [[Trident]].

The Mallisters are longstanding enemies of the [[Ironborn]], as Seagard was built as a defense against marauders from the [[Iron Islands]].<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-3/episode-1/map/location/44/seagard/ HBO viewers guide, season 3: episode 1 map, Seagard entry]</ref>

House Mallister's [[heraldry]] consists of a silver eagle on a blue field. Their [[house words]] are "Above the Rest."

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Mallister is one of House Tully's most loyal vassals. Lord Jason Mallister is noted as both a loyal vassal and also a close personal friend and ally of Lord [[Hoster Tully]]. During the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], the Mallisters defended Seagard from an [[ironborn]] [[Assault on Seagard|assault]]. While the town and castle were damaged and severe casualties incurred, the ironborn suffered significant losses, with Lord Jason slaying [[Rodrik Greyjoy]] in personal combat.

Following the Red Wedding, Lord Jason is one of the few Riverlords, alongside Tytos Blackwood and [[Brynden Tully]], who refuse to yield to the Iron Throne. However, after the Freys threaten to kill his son Patrek, he is forced to surrender.{{Bookref|AFFC|38}} Currently, he and his son are kept prisoners in his own castle.{{Bookref|AFFC|Appendix}}

A slight change is that in the books their sigil is a silver eagle on a purple field, but in the TV series, the field is blue.

===Members===
*Lord [[Jason Mallister]], the current head of the family. Currently held prisoner at Seagard.
**Ser Patrek Mallister, his eldest son and heir. Taken captive at the [[Red Wedding]]. Currently held prisoner at Seagard.
*Ser [[Denys Mallister]], Lord Jason's elderly uncle, a member of the [[Night's Watch]] and the commander of the [[Shadow Tower]].

No character named "Jaremy Mallister" has been mentioned in the books.
