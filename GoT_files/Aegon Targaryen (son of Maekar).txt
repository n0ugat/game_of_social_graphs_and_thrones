==In the books==
In the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Aegon was born in 200 AC in [[King's Landing]]. He has dark purple eyes, silver-gold hair, and pasty skin. At his birth, a green-and-white [[dragon]]'s egg was placed in his cradle, though like all other dragon's eggs after the [[Dance of the Dragons]], it never hatched. Aegon and his brother [[Aemon]] both wished to become [[dragonrider]]s.

Aegon lives at [[Summerhall]] with his father. He served at the royal court in the [[Red Keep]] for two years as a page, and sometimes attended the [[Small Council]].
