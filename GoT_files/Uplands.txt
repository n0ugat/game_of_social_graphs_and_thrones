'''Uplands'''{{Ref|GOT701}} is a castle ruled by [[House Mullendore]] in the [[Reach]], the region controlled by [[House Tyrell]] of [[Highgarden]]. The castle is located south of Highgarden and due east of [[Oldtown]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Uplands is the seat of House Mullendore. It is located due east of Oldtown on a tributary of the [[Honeywine]], amongst the foothills of the [[Red Mountains]] (which give it its name). House Mullendore is a vassal of [[House Hightower]] of Oldtown rather than the Tyrells directly.

Ser Mark Mullendore of Uplands was a noted [[Knighthood|knight]] in the service of [[Renly Baratheon]], noted for his trained black-and-white monkey. He switched allegiance to [[Stannis Baratheon]] after Renly's death. He lost an arm in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and was taken prisoner by the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. He bent the knee and swore fealty back to the [[Iron Throne]].
