==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the First Sword of Braavos is often chosen by the Sealord because he is the most observant of the [[bravo]]s (sword fighters), not necessarily because he is the most talented swordsman; therefore he is best able to protect him from threats both seen and unseen.

According to the appendix of ''A Feast for Crows'', the current First Sword of Braavos is Qarro Volentin.
