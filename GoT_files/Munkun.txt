{{Quote|<u>The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling</u> by Grand Maester Munkun.|Shireen Baratheon|The Dance of Dragons (episode)}}
'''Munkun '''was a [[Grand Maester]] and the author of the book ''[[The Dance of Dragons: A True Telling]]''.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Shireen Baratheon]] reads Munkun's work on the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|GOT509}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Munkun is mentioned as the author of ''The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling''. The book is said to be inaccurate in regard to some details.

In ''A Dance with Dragons'' (chapter 8, Tyrion III), while [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] travels with [[Jon Connington]] and the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], he writes down all the information he can get about dragons. One of the sources Tyrion relies on is Munkun's book, though to his opinion there are errors in it.
