{{Quote|Lys is the... "easiest" of the Free Cities, full of pleasure houses catering to every taste, no matter how peculiar. Many men lose themselves in Lys and are never found... at least alive.

'''Lys'''{{Ref|GOT102}} is one of the [[Free Cities]] located off the coast of [[Essos]]. It lies south of [[Pentos]], northwest of [[Volantis]] and north of the [[Summer Isles]]. The city stretches across several islands, which are separated from mainland Essos by narrow straits. Lys also has territorial possessions on the nearby regions of the mainland, east of [[Tyrosh]] and south of [[Myr]].

The famous [[Pleasure house|pleasure houses]] of Lys are known to train the finest bed-[[Slavery|slaves]] and [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] in the world, and they form the basis of the city's thriving export industry. Lys is also famous for producing a rare and difficult to detect poison known as the [[tears of Lys]].<ref>"[[Poisons]]"</ref>

People and things from Lys are known as '''Lysene'''{{HBOref|GOT102}} or '''Lyseni'''.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

==History==
===Background===
Like the other Free Cities, Lys was founded as a colony of the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. After the Freehold was destroyed in the [[Doom of Valyria]] Lys became an independent city-state during the ensuing [[Century of Blood]].

Lys is a longtime rival of the Free City of Myr, located to the north (the two of them have been feuding for centuries).

[[Irogenia of Lys]] was a famous courtesan from the city. Her beauty is still legendary long after her death, and she is said to have been the most attractive and skilled courtesan who ever lived.<ref name="E02">"[[The Kingsroad]]"</ref>

During the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]], [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] wagers [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] 100 [[Money|gold dragons]] that [[Gregor Clegane]] would win against [[Loras Tyrell]] in the joust. Baelish mused that 100 Gold Dragons could buy a dozen barrels of expensive [[Food and drink#Wines|Dornish wine]], or a very high-end prostitute from the pleasure-houses of Lys. 

Soon afterwards, Varys reveals to [[Eddard Stark]] that he suspects [[Jon Arryn]] was killed using the fast-acting and difficult to detect poison known as the Tears of Lys.<ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the [[A Song of Ice and Fire|''A Song of Ice and Fire'']] novels, Lys - also known as '''Lys the Lovely''' - is one of the more powerful of the [[Free Cities]], as well as the most beautiful: the land is covered with palm and fruit trees, the surrounding waters are abundant with fish, and sunsets in Lys are said to be the most beautiful in the world. The island chain known as the [[Stepstones]] lies to the northwest of the city and the [[Disputed Lands]] to the northeast. Lys frequently wars with the cities of [[Myr]], [[Tyrosh]], and [[Volantis]] over control of both these regions.

As with most of the Free Cities, Lys was founded as a colony of the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. Due to the area's natural beauty and mild climate, the [[Valyrians]] established Lys as a retreat/resort. Since it was founded from scratch by the Freehold rather than being a conquered territory, Lys retains stronger Valyrian bloodlines than any of the other Free Cities. Even the [[smallfolk]] often possess Valyrian features, including light-colored hair, skin, and eyes. The Valyrians themselves had platinum-blonde to silvery-white hair and purple eyes (as exemplified by the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]), though in the present-day common features associated with the Lysene are blonde hair and either blue, green or violet eyes, but still homogenously Valyrian. In contrast to Lys, the inhabitants of the city's great rival Myr tend to have dark hair, dark eyes and olive skin. Even the Targaryen rulers of [[Westeros]] sometimes looked towards Lys in search of wives and lovers, as much for their Valyrian blood as their beauty: Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]], brother to King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]], had a [[paramour]] from Lys, a dancer named Mysaria. King [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys II]] had been married to Lady Larra Rogare from Lys in his youth, and had three children by her, including the later [[Aegon IV Targaryen|King Aegon IV]], and the famous Prince [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]]. King Aegon IV's last mistress, Serenei, came from Lys as well, and bore him a daughter named Shiera, whilst dying in childbirth.

[[Slavery]] is legal in Lys and the city has a fairly large slave population, outnumbering freeborn citizens three to one. The pillow-houses of the city are far-famed, and they are known for producing the finest bed-slaves and [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] in the world. Beauty and blood purity are highly valued by the Lysene, who deliberately breed attractive slaves together in the hope that their offspring will be even more lovely and refined. Besides its bed-slaves and prostitutes, Lys is known for its production of tapestries, perfumes, and sweet wines. The alchemists of the city also produce two rare and deadly [[Poison|poisons]]; the [[tears of Lys]] and the [[strangler]].

Lys is home to a native love goddess (whose image graces the city's coinage), but temples to many deities can be found within its walls, including a temple to the [[Lord of Light]]. Another of these deities, the [[Weeping Lady]] of Lys, whose statue can also be seen in the [[House of Black and White]] in [[Braavos]]. So far, it is not clear in-universe if the Weeping Woman and the love goddess are the same figure or if they belong to separate traditions. 

While the Lysene are noted for their love of the sensual arts, they are also formidable sailors. Lys's navy is one of the most powerful on the [[Summer Sea|Summer]] and [[Narrow Sea|Narrow]] seas, aside from that of [[Braavos]], and Lysene freesails can be found in many of the ports of the world. 

When Valyria was destroyed in the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]], Lys became an independent state. It was then conquered by Volantis, which was trying to reforge the Freehold. Lys and Myr remained subservient to Volantis until the city overreached and launched an attack on Tyrosh. Myr rose in rebellion and an exiled Lysene lord liberated the city with the help of 100 warships loaned to him by Braavos. Additional forces from [[Pentos]] and the Westerosi [[Storm King]] helped defeat Volantis and destroyed its armies in what are now the Disputed Lands.

Lys regained its independence following the war, but the alliances soon fell apart, so that Myr and Lys have been perpetually warring with each other for the better part of the past three hundred years. The great rivalry of Myr and Lys is usually played out in the Disputed Lands between them, so-called because they are constantly changing hands between the two. Volantis and Tyrosh sometimes get dragged into these wars on one side or the other, as the alliances shift around.

When [[Eddard Stark]] came to arrest [[Jorah Mormont]] for selling poachers to slavers, Jorah and his wife [[Lynesse Hightower (daughter of Leyton)|Lynesse]] fled to Lys, where Jorah attempted to make his living as a sellsword, but he was unable to provide an income acceptable to Lynesse and she ran out on him to become a concubine to the Lysene merchant Lord [[Tregar Ormollen]].

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Lys" is pronounced "LEESE", as opposed to "Liss", "Lice", etc.
