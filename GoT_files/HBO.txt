It was launched in 1972 to transmit films and sporting events in the New York area, and expanded slowly to cover much of the country by the late 1990s. In 1997 HBO began transmitting its first original, one-hour drama series, ''[[wikipedia:Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'', which was followed by ''[[wikipedia:The Sopranos|The Sopranos]]'' in 1999, both critically acclaimed. ''The Sopranos'' went on to win 21 Emmy Awards. Over the next decade HBO went on to produce a number of commercially and critically-successful television series and mini-series, including ''[[wikipedia:Sex and the City|Sex and the City]]'', ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(TV_miniseries) Band of Brothers]'', ''[[wikipedia:Six Feet Under (TV series)|Six Feet Under]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Curb Your Enthusiasm|Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', ''[[wikipedia:The Wire (TV series)|The Wire]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]]'', ''[[wikipedia:True Blood|True Blood]]'', ''[[wikipedia:The Pacific (TV series)|The Pacific]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Treme (TV series)|Treme]]''.

HBO bought an option on the television rights to [[George R.R. Martin]]'s novel series ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' in January 2007, with [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] attached as showrunners. Development of the project and the writing of a pilot script was delayed due to the [[wikipedia:2007-2008 Writer's Guild of America strike|Writer's Guild of America]] strike in late 2007. HBO exercised its option to buy the television rights in September 2008 and ordered a pilot in November of that year, which was produced in October-November 2009. After viewing the pilot, HBO ordered a full season of 10 episodes in March 2010, with a view to begin airing the series in Spring 2011.

In 2017, before the conclusion of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', HBO ordered four pitch scripts for different [[World of Westeros|successor shows]], one of which was greenlit: ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', expected to release in 2022. In spring 2021, it was reported that HBO is now considering [[World of Westeros#2021-2022: Second wave of pitches, Warner Bros. Discovery era|several other potential prequels]].
