'''Ulthos'''<ref name="Map">[[:File:HotD Far East Map.jpg]]</ref> is a landmass located at the southeasternmost point of the [[known world]].

The landmass lies south of [[Asshai]] and the [[Shadow Lands]], separated from them by the [[Saffron Straits]]. Very little is known about it, and only a small section is recorded on maps made in [[Westeros]].<ref name="Map" />

==In the books==
In ''The Lands of Ice and Fire'' and ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', little is known of Ulthos other than its location, and that it is covered in dense jungle. [[George R.R. Martin]] has stated that it is intentionally ambiguous whether Ulthos is truly another "continent," or just a big island or another part of Essos, in order to highlight how people from Westeros do not know much of the world east of [[Qarth]] and south of the [[Summer Sea]].
