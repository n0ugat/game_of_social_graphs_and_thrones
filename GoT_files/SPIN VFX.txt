'''SPIN VFX''' is a visual effects agency that worked on [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Five-time Emmy nominated VFX Supervisor Doug Campbell and three-time Emmy nominated Supervising Producer Luke Groves led SPIN’s team to deliver over 200 shots for the season, including [[Mance Rayder]]'s [[Free Folk|wildling]] camp, compositing sequences to make the actor-dogs playing [[Direwolf|direwolves]] look bigger, the CGI crows, the 3D [[Unsullied]] army, and a matte painting of the [[Twins]].

One of their largest accomplishments was creating the 3D environment of the [[Wall]] as [[Jon Snow]], [[Ygritte]], and the wildling band led by [[Tormund]] scale the 700 foot high structure of ice. The Wall-scaling sequence alone was composed of 80 special effects shots.
