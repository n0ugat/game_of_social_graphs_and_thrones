===Reuse===
In an interview with IGN, composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] explained the reuse of the ''Game of Thrones'' theme in ''House of the Dragon'': "''I think that's a good example of tying back the old material with the new. As a franchise to just connect all of these stories together. In the original main title, we always looked at and thought of it as an overarching theme that connects all of the characters and the journey and the adventures of this universe. So we felt it would be appropriate to connect it with this main title theme again.''"<ref>https://www.ign.com/videos/what-made-house-of-the-dragon-composer-geek-out-ign-state-of-streaming-2022</ref>

Djawadi said on the official [[The Official Game of Thrones Podcast: House of the Dragon|''House of the Dragon'' podcast]]: "''The main theme since the beginning, well the intention was always that that's a theme that stands for everybody. Right? That's the overarching theme for the whole show. When we feel there's something of high importance we can say okay, now it is time to use the main theme. And this goes back to the original show, when we did not use it until the later episodes—Episodes 9 and 10—that's when we said okay, now it's time to start using [it]. [...] Same now in House of the Dragon. Where we felt towards the end of the episode, this is obviously of such significance, let's use the "Main Title" theme.''"<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxi6ChQjuFk</ref>
