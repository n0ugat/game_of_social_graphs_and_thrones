The '''Black Council'''{{Ref|TDOD}} is the [[Small Council]] of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] during the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen]] civil war known as the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. It was formed by the [[Blacks]] who were present on [[Dragonstone]] upon their learning of the [[Coup in King's Landing|coronation]] of [[Aegon II Targaryen]] in [[King's Landing]], and was rival to the [[Green Council]].

==Composition==
Upon learning of the green coup from Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] when she arrived on [[Dragonstone]], the [[Blacks]] who were already on Dragonstone, consisting of a number of lords and knights, formed their own rival council in support of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]: the Black Council. Rhaenyra herself went on to bear the crown of her father.{{Ref|HOTD110}} It is much more of an ''ad hoc'' council than a formal one. It was more loosely formed than the old [[Small Council]], consisting of Rhaenyra's own immediate advisors in her court at Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==Members==
The royal family members:
*Queen [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]
*Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]]
*Prince [[Jacaerys Velaryon]]
*Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon]]
*Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]]
*Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]]
*Lady [[Baela Targaryen]]
*Lady [[Rhaena Targaryen]]

At the outset of the [[Dance of the Dragons]]:
*Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]]
*Prince [[Jacaerys Velaryon]]
*Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon]]

Additionally, there were a number of lords, ladies and knights, including:
*[[Hand of the King|Hand of the Queen]], Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]]
*Lord [[Bartimos Celtigar]]
*Lord [[Simon Staunton]]
*Lord [[Gormon Massey]]
*Maester [[Gerardys]]
*[[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander of the Queensguard]], Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]]
*Ser [[Erryk Cargyll]]
*Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]]
*Ser [[Alfred Broome]]
*[[Mysaria]]

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire and Blood]]'' by [[George R.R. Martin]], the Black Council is largely the same, though it also includes Prince [[Joffrey Velaryon]], who is slightly older in the timeline.
