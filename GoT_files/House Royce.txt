'''House Royce'''{{Ref|HOTD105}} of [[Runestone]] is formerly a [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]]. It ruled over the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] as the [[Bronze King]], until it was deposed by [[House Arryn]] during the [[coming of the Andals]] and became its vassal ever since. It formerly was a vassal of [[House Stark]] of Winterfell, but now recognizes the [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms|Lord of the Six Kingdoms]] as its king. Their seat is located east of the [[Eyrie]], on the coast of the [[Narrow Sea]]. It is ruled by the veteran [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Yohn Royce]].

House Royce's [[Heraldry|heraldry]] consists of a pattern of black pebbles on a bronze field surrounded by runes in the [[Old Tongue]] of the [[First Men]]. Their [[house words]] are "We Remember."

==History==
During the [[coming of the Andals]], the head of House Royce, King [[Robar II Royce]], led and united the [[First Men]] of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] against the [[Andals]], defeating the invaders in numerous battles before forcing them to retreat to the [[Narrow Sea]].

When the Falcon Knight, Ser [[Artys Arryn]], became the leader of the Andals, House Royce and the First Men met them in the [[Battle of the Seven Stars]] under the [[Giant's Lance]]. Although the First Men gained the advantage of high ground, the Ser Artys was able to outflank and defeat Robar II. House Royce would then swear fealty to [[House Arryn]] and became its most prominent vassal.{{Ref|H&L615}}

==Behind the scenes==
*While no official explanation has been given regarding the runes on House Royce's sigil, they can be translated into the Latin script from Anglo-Saxon (futhorc) runes as "RUN BEFORE YOUR BLOOD RUNS".<ref>https://i.gyazo.com/af12e31d493e5852a9dfa4f4f0c865a2.png -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes#Rune_inventory</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Royces are the most powerful family in the Vale after the Arryns, and they are extremely loyal to House Arryn. House Royce is descended from the [[First Men]], which is a very rare exception in the Vale, as the First Men were almost completely driven from the Vale during the [[coming of the Andals]] six thousand years ago. This extends to the point that in modern times the nobility of the Vale are considered to represent the purest [[Andals|Andal]] bloodlines, exterminating the local First Men instead of intermingling with them. However, House Royce managed to survive, and is very proud of their descent from the First Men, to the point that they include runes of the [[Old Tongue]] of the First Men in their sigil.

===Known members===
* Lord Yohn Royce, called Bronze Yohn, Lord of Runestone, the ruler of the main branch of the family.
** Ser Andar Royce, his eldest son and heir.
** Ser {Robar Royce}, his second son, known as Robar the Red since joining Renly Baratheon's Rainbow Guard. Slain by [[Loras Tyrell]].
** Ser {Waymar Royce}, his youngest son, a ranger of the Night's Watch. Killed by the [[White Walkers|Others]].
** Ysilla Royce, his only daughter.

In the novels, House Royce has a cadet branch ruling from the Gates of the Moon. However, since the Gates of the Moon do not apparently exist in the TV series, it is unclear if this cadet branch has also been eliminated. Its known members are:
* Nestor Royce, a cousin of Yohn's, Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, High Steward of the Vale, ruler of the cadet branch of the family.
** Albar Royce, Nestor's son and heir.
** Myranda Royce, Nestor's daughter.

Lady Jeyne of House Royce was [[Jon Arryn]]'s first wife who died delivering a stillborn daughter.

Two other members are the deceased Lady Perra of House Royce, Lord [[Walder Frey]]'s first wife and Ser [[Stevron Frey]]'s mother, and Lady Ryella of House Royce who is married to Ser Arwood Frey, Lord [[Walder Frey]]'s grandson. Mya Stone, the [[bastard]] daughter of King [[Robert Baratheon]], serves as a mountain guide to the cadet branch of House Royce.

===Relationship to House Stark===
House Royce holds a blood-relationship to [[House Stark]] of the [[North]]: while it is an old connection, they still consider the Starks their kin, combined with their shared heritage as descendants of the First Men. Eddard Stark's paternal grandfather was Edwyle Stark, and Edwyle's younger sister Jocelyn Stark married Benedict Royce (apparently from the junior branch of the family). Jocelyn and Benedict had several children and at least three daughters, who married into [[House Waynwood]], [[House Corbray]], and House Templeton.

Lord Yohn Royce is the most vocal proponent among the Vale lords for openly joining Robb Stark's side during the War of the Five Kings (though Lysa suppresses these sentiments and enforce the Vale's neutrality). After the [[Red Wedding]], House Royce is close to open revolt over Lysa's failure to aid Robb in his war, and the Waynwoods, Redforts, Belmores, and Templetons are giving them every support.

After hearing of the [[Sack of Winterfell]], and the assumed death of his younger brothers, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] urges Robb to officially name one of his distant cousins from House Royce as his heir. [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is also assumed dead at the time, and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] had just been forced to marry [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], and both Robb and Catelyn correctly fear that should Robb die, the Lannisters are planning on installing any child born between Sansa and Tyrion as their puppet to rule the North. Robb disagrees on the grounds that it is still a distant relationship, and prefers to name his bastard half-brother [[Jon Snow]] as his heir, because a as king, Robb he can have Jon [[Legitimization|legitimized]]. Despite Catelyn's objections, Robb issues a decree that legitimizes Jon and names him his heir until a son is born to him from Jeyne Westerling, and several of the lords sign the decree as witnesses. It is unknown what has become of the decree, as it is no longer mentioned in the books.
