{{Quote|For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider.|[[Stannis Baratheon]] to [[Renly Baratheon]]|Garden of Bones (episode)}}
Lady '''Cassana Baratheon''', née '''Estermont''', was the mother of Kings [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], and [[Renly Baratheon]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Cassana was born to House Estermont, a noble house from the [[Stormlands]]. She became the [[Lord of Storm's End|Lady of Storm's End]] and the wife of Lord [[Steffon Baratheon]], the head of [[House Baratheon]], one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. They had three sons, Robert, Stannis and Renly Baratheon. She lived with her family in [[Storm's End]]. After [[Robert's Rebellion]], her eldest son assumed the [[Iron Throne]] on the grounds that he had the best claim out of all the rebel leaders, partly because Cassana had Targaryen blood.{{Ref|H&L310}}

Cassana and her husband died shortly before Robert's Rebellion when their ship, the ''[[Windproud]]'', sank in [[Shipbreaker Bay]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
She has an entry in the ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', as read by [[Eddard Stark]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

==Family==

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cassana comes from House Estermont. She married Steffon Baratheon and bore him three sons as in the series. She accompanied him on a trip to Essos. Their ship, the ''Windproud'', sank in Shipbreaker Bay within sight of Storm's End on their return voyage. Their bodies were never found.
Also, in the books, it was not Cassana who had Targaryen blood but her husband's mother, a daughter of King Aegon V Targaryen.
