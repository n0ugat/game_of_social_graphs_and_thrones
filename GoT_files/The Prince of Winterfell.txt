==Synopsis==
===Beyond the Wall===
[[File:Dragonglass.jpg|thumb|180x180px|The Night's Watch find hidden dragonglass.]]
[[Ygritte]] brings [[Jon Snow]] before the [[Lord of Bones]], who orders him executed, because he has already captured [[Qhorin]] and doesn't need two "crows" for questioning. Ygritte convinces him to spare Jon because of his Stark blood. Qhorin initiates a plan to install Jon as a spy within the [[Free Folk|wildling]] ranks.

[[Grenn]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] discover a cache of [[dragonglass]] weapons at the [[Fist of the First Men]]. Jon's absence has been noted, but Sam refuses to believe that he is dead.

=== In Qarth ===
Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] advises [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to leave her dragons and flee [[Qarth]], as he has recently booked passage to [[Astapor]]. She insists on attempting to reclaim them and asks Ser Jorah to lead her to the [[House of the Undying]], without knowing what lies in wait. 

=== At Winterfell ===
[[File:Theon and Dagmer.jpg|thumb|Theon gives Dagmer a pouch of gold to compensate for the killing of the orphans.]]
[[Yara Greyjoy]] arrives at [[Winterfell]] with a small band of [[Ironborn|men]], but instead of bringing reinforcements she offers [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] only advice. Winterfell is too far from the sea, they can't successfully defend it with so few soldiers, and the North is rising against him. She implores Theon to abandon the castle and return home with her, but he refuses to give up his prize. [[Dagmer]] tells Theon that after killing the orphans, he also murdered the [[Winterfell shepherd|farmer]] and his wife.

[[File:Bran and Rickon Alive.jpg|thumb|Bran overhears Luwin and Osha.]]
[[Luwin]] spots [[Osha]] sneaking into the catacombs. He follows her inside, and she explains that after reaching the farm she doubled back, using a stream to mask their scent from the hounds. Luwin urges her not to tell [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] about the children Theon had murdered, but Bran is sitting up behind a corner and listening to them.

=== In Blackwater Bay ===
[[Stannis Baratheon]]'s fleet is closing in on [[King's Landing]]. Stannis tells [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] that he admires him and offers him the [[Hand of the King]] role once he takes the throne.  

=== In King's Landing ===
[[File:Ros1.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Ros is revealed to have been captured by Cersei.]]
[[Tyrion Lannister]] scours history books seeking inspiration for his plans to defend the city. He takes advice from [[Bronn]] and [[Varys]] and implies that he has decided to make use of the stocks of [[wildfire]]. King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] is full of bravado, but his [[Cersei Lannister|mother]] is worried about letting him fight. She tries to ensure his safety by kidnapping the [[Prostitution|prostitute]] [[Ros]], believing that she is Tyrion's lover, to hold as collateral. Tyrion hides his relief that [[Shae]] is safe and ardently vows revenge against his sister. 

=== At Harrenhal ===
[[File:Jaqen_H'ghar_2x8_1.png|thumb|right|Arya gives Jaqen his own name]]

Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] is torn between needing to defend [[King's Landing]] and wanting to drive King [[Robb Stark]] from the [[Westerlands]]. His brother [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] warns that Stannis will execute Cersei and Joffrey after capturing the capital. Tywin decides to march west, leaving [[Arya Stark]] at [[Harrenhal]] to serve his castellan, Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]. Realizing that she has missed her chance to kill Tywin, Arya pressures the assassin [[Jaqen H'ghar]] into aiding her escape from Harrenhal. She forces him to help her by giving him his own name as the third death he promised. She will only revoke his name when he agrees to break her and her friends out of the fortress. Arya, [[Hot Pie]], and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] walk through the gates at midnight, as Jaqen instructed. They escape Harrenhal, realizing that the guards have been killed.

=== In the Westerlands ===
Robb is furious when he learns that his mother has freed [[Jaime Lannister|his most important captive]]. He tells her that she has betrayed him and orders her kept under guard. Catelyn has sent [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] to escort Jaime to King's Landing to exchange him for her daughters. Brienne uses a canoe to evade pursuit. Robb plans to relieve Winterfell by turning Theon's men against him with an offer of mercy, issuing his orders to the [[Ramsay Bolton|bastard of the Dreadfort]] through [[Roose Bolton]]. Robb seeks solace in the arms of [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]], ignoring his betrothal to [[House Frey]].

==Behind the scenes==
*The episode title refers to chapter 37 of ''A Dance with Dragons'', the fifth novel in the series of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''; it is also the title Theon gives himself in the second novel ''A Clash of Kings'' after he captures Winterfell. Yara mockingly refers to Theon by that title.
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of the [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#House Stark theme|House Stark theme]]. In the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2 (Music from the HBO Series)|official soundtrack release]] it is titled "Winterfell."
*The episode won a [[wikipedia:Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Costumes in a Series in September 2012.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/ Westeros.org]</ref>
*Yara's statement "''We both loved our mother''" is the first (and only) reference in the show to [[Alannys Greyjoy]]. It is unclear what Alannys's status is; just because Yara talked about her in past tense, it does not necessarily mean she is dead.
*The cherry pits [[Hot Pie]] uses in his recipe would be poisonous in real life. This may not be the case in the universe of GoT.
*Lord Karstark says a line about "the Father," one of the aspects of the godhead in the [[Faith of the Seven]], but the Karstarks worship the [[Old Gods]]. Writer [[Bryan Cogman]] responded about this: "the line about Karstark praying to the Father in 208... yeah, I should've caught that. Karstark would be strictly Old Gods, I think. If it helps, you could read it as "I'd even break my faith and pray to the bloody FATHER if that's what it took to bring my sons back"... but I'm not sure that was the intent. But maybe it was. I try my best!"<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.</ref>
*Tyrion and, by extension, Varys, become the first ongoing characters west of the Narrow Sea to be aware of the survival of [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and the existence of her dragons.
*Talisa's speech to Robb Stark explaining her backstory in Volantis is an invention of the TV series. In the books, Talisa's equivalent character is Jeyne Westerling, a noblewoman from a minor Lannister vassal family, House Westerling. This is the only scene in which Talisa ever explains her altered backstory, but the changes do not appear to be fully researched and contain several contradictions:
**Robb Stark is around 18 years old in Season 1, because he was conceived at the start of Robert's Rebellion, which ended 17 years ago (increasing his age in the books by two years). Numerous other times in the TV series itself, characters have mentioned that Westeros is at the end of a very long summer which has lasted for 10 years (the start of autumn was officially announced in the Season 2 premiere). When Talisa describes her backstory, she says that she and her brother went to bathe in the Rhoyne River when she was 12 years old, because it was the hottest day in the "three year summer." The 10 year long summer that ended in the Season 2 premiere began when Robb was around 9 years old. It is possible (though unlikely) that an autumn/winter/spring cycle quickly occurred during a single year, preceded by a three-year long summer (the seasons are not regular). In which case this incident could have occurred no more than 11 years ago when Robb was around 5 to 6 years old. Talisa, however, states that she was 12 at the time, meaning she would have to be ''at least'' five to six years older than Robb. In the books, Jeyne Westerling is roughly the same age as Robb Stark, and while Talisa in the TV continuity is a separate character, the actors playing Robb and Talisa were actually born within two weeks of each other. When the writers developed this altered backstory for "Talisa" including an off-hand mention of a "three year summer," they apparently didn't consider that the ''current'' summer lasted for ten full years.
**The nobles and slaves of Volantis never mingle, and they are one of the most segregated of the Free Cities. On the other hand, Talisa's story somewhat implies that she and her brother sneaked off because their parents were away at a wedding and they weren't supposed to be in mixed company at the river, and this was just an exceptional incident in which all classes mingled at the river due to a heatwave.
**Talisa says that drummers were playing for "coppers" on the east bank of the river. "Copper pennies" are a [[Money|currency]] of the Seven Kingdoms, not Volantis. The Seven Kingdoms use the Gold Dragon coin, of which Silver Stags and Copper Pennies are smaller denominations. Volantis uses round gold coins called "honors"–there may be smaller Volantene denominations made of copper, but they have not been mentioned in the books.
**Talisa's speech does, however, accurately relate a detail from the books, that slaves in Volantis are given facial tattoos so people can recognize them just by looking at them.
**According to Talisa, the unnamed slave revived her brother by repeatedly pressing on his chest, until he spat out the water he swallowed and started breathing again. Indeed, this is one of the methods of the modern reviving technique known as [[Wikipedia:Cardiopulmonary_resuscitation|CPR]].
*Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys "They [the dragons] didn't suckle at your breast, they are dragons". In the second novel, it is mentioned that Daenerys breastfed her dragons, until the milk in her breasts dried up as a result of the march in the Red Waste.
*Jaime claims that "There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me", without mentioning names. Regardless of the identity of the three men Jaime referred to (he might have spoken generally), it is clearly an empty bragging: Jaime is definitely one of the most skilled warriors in Westeros, but surely there are plenty of warriors he has never fought against or even never heard of.
*After arresting Ros, Cersei taunts Tyrion "Have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased." Clearly this is a reference to [[Tysha]], whom Tyrion married and by that greatly angered Tywin ("[[Baelor]]").
