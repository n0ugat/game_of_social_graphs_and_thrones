{{Quote|She was Drogo's first gift to me.|[[Daenerys Targaryen]] to [[Jorah Mormont]]|The North Remembers}}
'''Daenerys Targaryen's mare''' is a mare given to [[Daenerys Targaryen]] by ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] as a wedding gift.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
At their wedding, Drogo gives Daenerys her mare as a gift. Daenerys declares that she is beautiful and asks Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] what the word for "thank you" is in [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]]. Jorah replies that there is no such word. Dany rides her mare as she and Drogo depart to consummate their marriage.{{Ref|GOT101}}

In pain due to her inexperience in horseback riding, Daenerys needs to be helped down from her mare by her handmaidens.{{Ref|GOT102}}

Daenerys rides her mare through the [[Dothraki Sea]]{{Ref|GOT103}} and on to [[Vaes Dothrak]].{{Ref|GOT104}}

After a [[wineseller]] is caught attempting to poison Daenerys, he is punished by being stripped and bound with a rope to her mare's saddle and is pulled along the road as the ''[[khalasar]]'' makes it's way to [[Lhazar]].{{Ref|GOT107}}

Daenerys leaps from her mare to help Drogo when he falls from his horse, a wound he received in his duel with [[Mago]] having festered due to treachery of [[Mirri Maz Duur]].{{Ref|GOT109}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Her mare dies of starvation in the [[Red Waste]]. Daenerys takes her death very hard, as she was the first gift Drogo gave her.{{Ref|GOT201}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Drogo gives Daenerys the silver as a wedding gift. Unlike in the show, it is not white but grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke (hence its name).

Daenerys's silver does not die in the Red Waste in the books, but continues with her to Slaver's Bay. So far she is alive and well. When Daenerys does obtain the [[Unsullied]] in [[Astapor]] in the TV series, she acquires a new, similar silver horse.

In a sample chapter of ''The Winds of Winter'', Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] rides the silver to battle in the [[second siege of Meereen#In the books|second siege of Meereen]]. He feels a bit uncomfortable doing so, regarding it as presumptuous action, but believes it is important to have some symbol of his queen around to improve morale among those who are loyal to her, even in her absence. Moreover, the silver has been years in the company of Daenerys's dragons, and has grown accustomed to their sight and scent - in contrast to the enemy's horses.
