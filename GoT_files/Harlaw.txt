==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Harlaw is the second largest island after [[Great Wyk]], and is the richest and most populous island.

[[House Harlaw]] are the overlords of much if not most of the island, and they are one of the most powerful vassals of the Greyjoys. [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s wife [[Alannys Greyjoy|Alannys]] was also born into House Harlaw. The current head of House is Rodrik Harlaw, maternal uncle to Theon and Asha (called [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] in the TV series). Rodrik and House Harlaw are major supporters of Asha.
