'''Prince of Dorne'''{{Ref|GOT401}}{{Note|Feminine: '''Princess of Dorne'''{{Con|TWOI&F}}}} is a title in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] for the ruler of the administrative region of [[Dorne]] under the authority of the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]]. It has been used since before [[Aegon's Conquest]].

Prince [[Doran Martell]], was [[Coup in Dorne|killed]] along with his heir, Prince [[Trystane Martell]]. It is unclear whether [[Ellaria Sand]] ever assumed the title Princess of Dorne after her coup, although since her imprisonment in [[King's Landing]] by Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], a new [[Prince of Dorne (Last War)|Prince of Dorne]] has assumed the title.

==History==
While the title "[[Prince]]" in other parts of the Seven Kingdoms is typically used to indicate the heir to the throne, [[Dorne]] has Ruling Princes (or Ruling Princesses). This is a holdover from centuries ago when the [[Rhoynar]] ruled city-states along the [[Rhoyne]] River in [[Essos]]. Dorne had a Ruling Prince when it was an independent kingdom, and only unified with the Targaryen realm one century ago - not through conquest but through marriage-alliance. As a result of this voluntary union, the [[Iron Throne]] allowed the Martell rulers of Dorne to continue to style themselves as "Princes" even though they are no longer the absolute sovereign.

When Dorne finally joined with the rest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] through a [[marriage]] alliance, the [[Iron Throne]] allowed the Martells to retain the title along with their laws. As with most Dornish titles, succession to the title is granted to the eldest surviving heir regardless of gender.

After Dorne unified with the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, there is apparently no ''functional'' difference between a "Prince of Dorne" and a "Lord Paramount" that rules another region, but the title "Prince" is still considered to be more prestigious.

The offspring and siblings of the Prince of Dorne also hold the title of Prince or Princess.

:There is apparently no distinction between ''the'' "Prince of Dorne" - the head of House Martell who rules Dorne - and other "Princes of Dorne" who are younger brothers of the current ruler, such as between Doran Martell and his younger brother [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn]]. The Wiki of Westeros has been conjecturally using the title "Ruling Prince" of Dorne to refer to actual rulers such as Doran, but it isn't clear if this is a term they would actually use. Theoretically, ''every'' male member of House Martell for the past one thousand years has been called a "Prince", and ''every'' female member has been called a "Princess". This, of course, only applies to legitimate members of the family who bore the name "Martell" - acknowledged bastards do not get called a "Prince" or "Princess". As a result Oberyn Martell's eight bastard daughters, known as the "[[Sand Snakes]]", do not carry the title "Princess".
