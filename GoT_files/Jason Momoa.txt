'''Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa''' (born August 1, 1979) is an American actor and model, who starred as ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] in ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Biography==
Momoa was born in Honolulu, Oahu, Hawaii, but was raised in Iowa. His father is Hawaiian, and his mother is of German-Scottish ancestry. In 1999, he won the Title of Hawaii Model of the Year, which won him a role on ''Baywatch Hawaii''. He is best known for playing the role of [[wikipedia:Ronon Dex|Ronon Dex]] for four years on ''[[wikipedia:Stargate Atlantis|Stargate Atlantis]]''. He is also starred as the titular character in ''[[wikipedia:Conan (film)|Conan]]'', the remake film depiction of the ''[[wikipedia:Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Barbarian]]'' character previously made famous by [[wikipedia:Arnold Schwarznegger|Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. Most recently he has played Arthur Curry/Aquaman in the DC Comics-based films ''Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice'', ''Justice League'' and ''Aquaman'' — as well as [[w:c:see:Baba Voss|the lead]] in the Apple TV+ series, ''[[w:c:see:See|See]]''.

He and actress Lisa Bonet have been together since 2005 and have two children. In 2008, Momoa had reconstructive surgery after having his face slashed with a broken beer glass. His attacker is currently serving a five-year sentence.

He confirmed that he would be playing the role of ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] on 17 October 2009 at a convention in New Zealand. He was the last actor cast for the pilot, although not the last announced.

Throughout his tenure on the show, Momoa did not appear in the opening credits, instead receiving an "Also Starring" credit at the end of each episode in which he appeared.

Momoa's exit from the series was planned from the start, since Drogo dies at the end of the first book, but most of the cast and crew were sorry to see him go. As a treat for everyone involved, Momoa was invited back for a cameo appearance in the [[Valar Morghulis|final episode]] of the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]]. It was successfully kept a secret from the viewers until the transmission of the episode.
