The '''Tower of the Hand'''{{Ref|GOT307}} was a location within the [[Red Keep]] in [[King's Landing]]. It served as the residence of the [[Hand of the King]] or Hand of the Queen and his household. Among other rooms, it contained a dining room, the Hand's study, the Hand's bedchamber and connecting corridors and stairways.

==Behind the scenes==
In the audio commentary track for ''[[The North Remembers]]'', [[D.B. Weiss]] revealed that falcons representing [[House Arryn]] on the wall still remain since neither [[Eddard Stark]] nor [[Tyrion Lannister]] have had time to redecorate after [[Jon Arryn]]'s death.

==In the books==
In ''A Feast for Crows'', following the death of Tywin Lannister, Cersei orders the Tower of the Hand burned to the ground by wildfire, because she cannot bear its look, keeping in mind that her father dies inside it, [[Shae|a whore]] in his bed (she also hope the fire may smoke a few rats from the rubble, like Tyrion and Varys). Jaime objects, fearing that the fire will spread beyond the tower, but Cersei insists. She is angered by Jaime's comment "Now you sound like Aerys".

The burning of the tower is performed right after the wedding of Tommen and Margaery. The guests watch in awe how the tower is burnt, as if it is a fireworks display. Since everyone knows about Cersei's plan in advance, and the destruction of the building is done in a controlled manner, no one is harmed by it.{{Bookref|AFFC|12}}

Watching the building being consumed by wildfire, Cersei feels a strange excitement, as if the wildfire is cleansing her, burning away all her rage and fear, filling her with resolve. Jaime notices her expression, and is filled with disquiet: it strongly reminds him of the mad king and the way a burning would sexually arouse him.{{Bookref|AFFC|16}}

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Cersei tells Kevan that Mace Tyrell seeks to rebuild the Tower. Kevan comments that the new tower will be twice as tall as the one Cersei burned. Cersei laughs "Long lances, tall towers... is Lord Tyrell hinting at something?."{{Bookref|ADWD|72}}
