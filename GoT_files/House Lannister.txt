'''House Lannister'''{{Ref|GOT105}} of [[Casterly Rock]] is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]], one of its richest and most powerful families and one of its oldest dynasties. It was briefly the royal house of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] until their defeat in the [[Last War]].

The Lannisters rule over the [[Westerlands]]. Their seat is Casterly Rock, a massive rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea which has had habitations and fortifications built into it over the millennia. They are the Lords Paramount of the [[Westerlands]] and Wardens of the West. As the new royal house, they also ruled directly over the [[Crownlands]] from their seat of the [[Red Keep]] in [[King's Landing]], the traditional seat of the royal family. House Lannister's [[heraldry]] consists of a golden lion on a crimson background, and their [[house words]] are "Hear me roar!", which are rarely mentioned.<ref>"[[House Lannister (short)|House Lannister]]"</ref><ref name=":0">"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref> Their unofficial motto, which is as well known as the official one, is "A Lannister always pays his debts" - which is used much more often and mostly in negative context, though it can also be used in the original, literal sense.

The [[Incest|incestuous]] relationship of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] had been concealed in a conspiracy. Their son [[Joffrey Baratheon]] had claimed the [[Iron Throne]] on the premise that he was actually fathered by the late [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]]. [[Tywin Lannister|Lord Tywin]] was a key supporter of his reign in the War of the Five Kings. The Lannisters continued to hold sway when [[Tommen Baratheon]] ascended the throne, with [[Kevan Lannister]] as [[Hand of the King]] and [[Protector of the Realm]], but lost their hold over Tommen to the [[Faith of the Seven]], and, after destroying the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], Cersei took the throne. With the deaths of Cersei and Jaime at the [[Battle of King's Landing]], Tyrion is now the head of House Lannister and given up the crown in favor of an elective monarchy. It currently swears fealty directly to the King of the Andals and the First Men, an office which is currently held by [[Bran Stark]].

==History==
===Background===
House Lannister is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. Their lands are in the far west of the continent. Their seat is [[Casterly Rock]], a castle on a rocky promontory overlooking the Sunset Sea. It overlooks the thriving city of [[Lannisport]] and sits atop the most productive gold mine in the Westerlands.<ref name=":2">"[[House Lannister (short)|House Lannister]]"</ref> They are the wealthiest family in the realm.<ref name="House Lannister viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/lannister/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Lannister entry]</ref> 

[[File:ReyneRebellion.png|thumb|The red lion of Reyne confronts the golden lion of Lannister]]
Fair-haired, tall and handsome, the modern Lannisters are the blood of [[Andals|Andal]] adventurers who carved out a mighty kingdom in the western hills and valleys. Through the female line, they boast of descent from [[Lann the Clever]], the legendary trickster of the [[Age of Heroes]] who swindled Casterly Rock from [[House Casterly]]. They used to rule the [[Westerlands]] as the Kings of the Rock before swearing allegiance to [[House Targaryen]]. They have since served the Targaryens and now [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert Baratheon]] as the Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West. The gold of [[Casterly Rock]] and the [[Golden Tooth]] has made them the wealthiest of the Great Houses.<ref name=":2" /><ref name="House Lannister viewers guide" />

[[File:House Lannister banner.jpg|thumb|301x301px|The banner of House Lannister of [[Casterly Rock]], the rulers of the [[Westerlands]].]]
Tywin Lannister is the current head of the family. His father [[Tytos Lannister]] presided over a period of decline for the house, to the point that their vassals [[House Reyne]] [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt|rebelled]] against Lord Tytos. Tywin put down the rebellion personally, extinguishing their house and re-establishing the fearsome reputation of House Lannister. His ruthlessness gave darker meaning to the common phrase "A Lannister always pays his debts" and was immortalized in the song "[[The Rains of Castamere]]."<ref name=":2" /><ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref>

Tywin has three children: [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] by his wife [[Joanna Lannister]]. Cersei is Queen of Westeros since Tywin arranged for her marriage to King [[Robert Baratheon]], in exchange for his support in [[Robert's Rebellion]].<ref name="House Lannister viewers guide" /> She has a longstanding incestuous relationship with her brother Jaime. The two conspire to conceal their love and have passed their children (Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen) off as being the product of Cersei's marriage.<ref name=":3" />

Though Cersei has succeeded in wiping out nearly all of her primary enemies, her last surviving child Tommen commits suicide. [[House Baratheon of King's Landing]] – and the main branch, [[House Baratheon]] - becomes officially extinct.

==Military strength==
[[File:Lannister-army.jpg|thumb|A Lannister host marching in the Reach.]]
Due to its wealth, House Lannister is capable of fielding thousands of troops (it is not mentioned how many of the 60,000 men, which Tywin rallies from the Westerlands in "[[You Win or You Die]]", belong to House Lannister). As the richest House, the Lannisters' forces are among the best-equipped in the Seven Kingdoms.

However, the military strength of the Westerlands has been badly depleted due to the War of the Five Kings (half of it was destroyed in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]] alone), as well as the Last War. Battles against the armies of the North, the Baratheons, and later Daenerys's forces, have cut their numbers down to size. 
[[File:IMG 1971.JPG|thumb|House Lannister takes [[Sack of Highgarden|Highgarden]].]]
According to Tyrion, [[Casterly Rock]] alone, even by Season 7, still held a garrison of at least 10,000 Lannister soldiers, well trained and provisioned.<ref>"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref> However, much of this army has been later destroyed by the Targaryen forces in the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], and its remnants have essentially been wiped out in the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. 

Lannister armies seem to be more well-equipped than any other armies that Westeros could muster. This is particularly evidenced by the high quality arms and armor forged directly in the Crownlands and Westerlands, by skilled smithies and armorers. An advanced degree of standardization and role differentiation between cavalry, heavy infantry, archers and sappers is clear.
[[File:S07E04-Lannister soldiers.jpg|thumb|Fighting Dothraki at the Battle of the Goldroad.]]

Lannister soldiers are typically outfitted in excellent quality armor. Sturdy, red-dyed leather coated over augmented steel armor plates, in a striking combination. This smart design, is not only aesthetically impressive - as per Lannister lavishness - but also ergonomically practical, with the segmented armor allowing for ample mobility and flexibility for the wearer. 

They also have crested steel and leather helmets, with uniquely designed cheek visors which overlap when locked shut, forming a broad facial plate with small eye slots which still give good visibility. The horizontally arrayed crests on their helmets, are a kind of defensive feature to deflect blade strikes. When the facial visors are opened, the soldier can get a better view of their surrounding vicinity, as well as talk with or to civilians more personally in their patrol duties or guard duties. The closed visors also give a deliberate resemblance to the face of a lion, looking directly forward towards it. Arguably, the design is as much for show, as for practical effectiveness.

Lannister armor and robes, also use vast quantities of scarlet red and blood red dye, across the Lannister military forces, universally. Cloaks, robes and under layers padding the armor, the best that money could buy. They are well-protected by ovate and rounded kite shields. Adorning these are intricately carved lions, and painted blazons/sigils of House Lannister; red and yellow-gold being the main color palette. The ubiquitous style of the Lannister garments and armor and the spectacular marching formations as seen at [[Highgarden]] indicates a well-organized system of military procurement, to militarily efficient standards.

The Lannisters also command a modest [[Lannister fleet|fleet]], berthed at Lannisport. The original fleet belonging to Lord Tywin directly, was largely destroyed at anchor during the Greyjoy Rebellion in a [[Raid on Lannisport|preemptive strike]], led by [[Euron Greyjoy]].<ref name=":4" />
[[File:Game-of-Thrones-Ballista.png|thumb|Lannister [[scorpion]].]]
House Lannister has also developed two models of Scorpion ballistae artillery, with the aid of [[Qyburn]]. The variant shown in Season 7, was used to injure Drogon.<ref name=":1" /> It is a lighter model and fired a more basic bolt as a projectile. Apparently only a single unit of this was built as a prototype, and taken into service for Jaime's field army in S7. After this unit was destroyed by Drogon, Qyburn went back to the drawing board and improved the design considerably; with the second model of Scorpion ballistae being a huge improvement on the previous design.

The improved Scorpion ballistae seen in Season 8, are bigger, heavier, more powerful and fire much more lethal bolts (apparently with design input by Euron, due to the opening, kraken-shaped bladed heads on the much larger and nastier bolts). These bolts visibly have greater penetrative power and can do terrible damage. They are used to brutal effect against both Rhaegal and a portion of Daenerys Targaryen's remaining fleet [[Battle at Dragonstone|at Dragonstone]].<ref name="Stormborn" />
[[File:Scorpions-are-back-in-westeros-v0-sl8n9hxsoqpc1.jpg|thumb|Scorpions defending the Red Keep.]]
There were dozens of these artillery units, arrayed on the battlements of King's Landing and fitted to ships of the Iron Fleet, with specially trained Lannister and Greyjoy engineer crews manning them. Though deadly even to dragons, they were slow to reload as well as difficult to turn, due to their own size. None of Cersei's or Euron's artillery scored hits on Drogon, and all were destroyed by dragon-fire in short order.

The Lannisters have held sway with the threat of their potent military since shortly after Robert's Rebellion ended. However, depleted by wars and hardships, the glory days of House Lannister's army are by now already long gone. Queen Cersei has enlisted 20,000 [[Golden Company]] mercenaries from [[Essos]], to help augment and boost their forces back up to a healthy level. However, both the Golden Company and the remaining Lannister forces have been decisively defeated - more accurately, brutally massacred - at the Battle of King's Landing, by the combined Targaryen and Stark-Vale forces.<ref name="E72" />

===Cadet branches===
House Lannister is a very old and wealthy family, dating back to the [[Age of Heroes]] and the [[Andals|Andal]] invasion 6,000 years ago. As a result it has produced numerous cadet branches and distant cousins of the main line, who have prospered as members of the minor nobility in the Westerlands for many years. In contrast, while [[House Stark]] is even older than House Lannister, due to the harsh conditions of the North (both low economic output and threat of wildling attacks) by the time of the [[War of the Five Kings]], the Starks possess few if any cousins, and only one major cadet branch, [[House Karstark]]. Therefore, there are numerous minor members of the extended "House Lannister" who exist in the background of the narrative, but they are so numerous and distantly related that members of the main line wouldn't think to mention them any more than they would their other vassals.

*Ser {[[Alton Lannister]]}, a cousin to Jaime, Cersei, and Tyrion from a lesser branch of the family. A prisoner of [[House Stark]]. Killed by Jaime as part of an escape attempt. He stated that his mother is [[Cynda Lannister]].

The official Lannister motto, "Hear Me Roar", is a reference to the [[lion]] on the House's sigil, an animal that is powerful, fierce, and strong. Behind closed doors, however, they are known for their unofficial motto: "A Lannister always pays his debts". On one level, this represent the Lannister richness and their pride for it. They trade for having money (e.g [[Tyrion Lannister]]'s relationship with [[Bronn]]). On a literal level, this boasts their reliability and the honorable repayment. Unfortunately, this also has a dark flip side: when wronged, a Lannister seeks revenge.

The Lannister colors are gold and crimson. Gold is associated with a crown, and money, something the Lannisters have aplenty, and being the best, as in with a medal, just as the Lannister see themselves as superior. It is also an eye-catching color that demands attention. Like their golden hair, gold is a color of sunny false appearances. Crimson indicates [[Noble house|nobility]] and status. Both in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome Roman] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabethan_era Elizabethan] eras, crimson (and its natural derivative purple) were colors only warn by important people, such as monarchs and military leaders. Yet they are not truly royalty and gain stature by social climbing and being close to royalty: [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] was [[Hand of the King]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] was in the [[Kingsguard]], and Cersei married the king himself, thus enabling all her children to become [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|kings and queens]]. Also, it is the color of the Sun, which through its [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_deity mythological and religious heritage] is associated with many positive traits.

The House sigil, a lion, is also symbolic. Throughout history, lions have always been depicted as kings of the jungle, again signifying their life of royalty.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Lannister was established many thousands of years prior to the books' opening by a trickster-hero called Lann the Clever, who tricked the powerful Casterly family into abandoning their stronghold of [[Casterly Rock]], which the Lannisters took for their own. The Lannisters have ruled the region known as the Westerlands ever since, getting rich off the many gold and silver mines in the western hills and mountains.

During [[Robert's Rebellion]], the Lannisters sat out most of the war, refusing to heed the calls of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] to aid him in crushing the rebellion. After the rebel victory at the [[Battle of the Trident]], the Lannister army marched to the relief of [[King's Landing]] but, instead of helping defend the city, they brutally sacked it, killing King Aerys and his grandchildren. Robert Baratheon publicly pardoned the Lannisters for their actions and accepted their allegiance, marrying Cersei Lannister in thanks for Tywin's assistance. However, [[Eddard Stark]] saw the Lannister action as betrayal and murder, and has not trusted them ever since. Due to the actions of House Lannister, as well as being responsible for the brutal murder of Rhaegar's wife Elia Martell and their two children, this earned them the ire of Dorne and its ruling house, House Martell, in which both region and house made a full withdrawal from interacting with the royal court.

House Lannister consists of a "main" branch led by Lord Tywin and a junior branch, led by cousins, that controls the city of Lannisport. The Lannisters are a relatively large family, though nowhere near as numerous as the [[House Frey|Freys of the Crossing]].

A minor change is that in the books the heraldry of House Lannister features a lion passant (striding on all four legs), but in the TV series the lion is rampant (rearing up with its forepaws raised to attack). The variant with the striding, passant lion is still glimpsed on several occasions in the TV series (i.e. Tywin's battle-flags during the [[battle on the Green Fork]]), though it is not the primary version featured in promotional materials.

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Lannister" is pronounced "LAN-iss-ter". It rhymes with "Lancaster". The conflict between the "Starks and Lannisters" in the series is loosely inspired by the English War of the Roses between the "Yorks and Lancasters".

Martin has said that the [[War of the Five Kings]] is based on the Wars of the Roses in England from 1455 until 1485. House Lannister is inspired by the House of Lancaster right down to having a red crest and a lion as their sigil.
