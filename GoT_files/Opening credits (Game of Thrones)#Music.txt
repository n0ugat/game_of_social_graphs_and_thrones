The opening credits consists of a three-dimensional map of the world, with the continents of [[Westeros]] and [[Essos]] located on the inner surface of a sphere. At the center of the sphere is a light source, effectively a sun surrounded by an [[wikipedia:Armillary sphere|armillary sphere]] or astrolabe-like arrangement of rotating rings. The details of the opening credits change each week depending on the locations visited. The following description is how the sequence appears in the first episode of the series, "[[Winter Is Coming]]".

The sequence opens with a close-up of the sun and the astrolabe surrounding it. Relief details are visible on the astrolabe, showing a volcano destroying a city while a [[dragon]] watches on and several people escaping in a boat, a reference to the [[Doom of Valyria]] and the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] escape from it. The camera then pans to a wide-shot of Westeros and Essos before zooming in on the city of [[King's Landing]], in particular the sigil of [[House Baratheon]] on what appears to be a large gear in the middle of the city. The gear begins turning, moving other cogs, and then three-dimensional buildings start rising out of the ground, such as the [[Red Keep]] and the [[Great Sept of Baelor]].

Once the city is assembled, the camera moves north over the [[Kingsroad]] across Westeros to [[Winterfell]], which similarly rises out of the ground while a gear bearing the sigil of [[House Stark]] rotates. The camera pays particular attention to the [[godswood]] of Winterfell and its heart tree as it rises out of the ground before panning up to the sun and astrolabe. There is then another close-up of the detail on the astrolabe, this time showing the Stark [[direwolf]], [[House Lannister|Lannister]] [[lion]] and Baratheon stag engaging the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[dragon]] in combat, a reference to [[Robert's Rebellion]].

The camera returns to Winterfell and then pans north to the [[Wall]], where more gears start turning and [[Castle Black]] emerges from the ground, while the pulley lift emerges from the face of the Wall. The camera pulls all the way back to King's Landing before moving across the [[Narrow Sea]] to the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Pentos]], which similarly emerges from the ground while gears rotate.

The opening credits ends with a return to the relief detail of the astrolabe, now showing the animals representing the various [[noble house]]s of Westeros bowing to the triumphant Baratheon stag. The ''Game of Thrones'' logo then appears over the astrolabe, with the heads of a dragon, wolf, lion, and stag emerging from the side of the logo.

Throughout the series, the opening credits continues to change and add locations, depending on the locations visited in that particular episode. In the first season, [[Vaes Dothrak]], the [[Eyrie]], and the [[Twins]] appeared. [[Dragonstone]], [[Pyke]], [[Harrenhal]] and [[Qarth]] first appeared in the second season. [[Astapor]], [[Riverrun]], and [[Yunkai]] first appeared in the third season. The [[Dreadfort]], [[Meereen]], [[Braavos]], and [[Moat Cailin]] first appeared in the fourth season, while the region of [[Dorne]] was the only location added during the fifth season. No new locations were added to the opening credits during the sixth season. [[Oldtown]] and [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea|Eastwatch]] first appeared in the seventh season.

However, the opening credits shown in the eighth season differs majorly from that of previous seasons. Although the sequence still opens with a close-up of the sun and the astrolabe surrounding it, the events visible on the astrolabe tell the plot of the aforementioned seasons rather than Westerosi history: showing the [[Breaching of the Wall]]. In contrast with the previous sequence, the large crevice left in the [[Wall]] following the breach is shown initially (rather than King's Landing), after which white tiles begin to emerge from the layers of mapping, symbolizing the movement of the [[Wight|army of the dead]]. Then the camera goes to Winterfell as it emerges to the ground, focusing on the [[godswood]], then coming inside the [[throne room]] and then to the crypt. After panning to the sun and the astrolabe (which depicts the [[Red Wedding]] at this point), the camera pans to King's Landing, then to the gears pulling up one of the gates. Then the camera goes to the Red Keep, entering one of its towers, coming to the cellars while passing over the [[Scorpion|ballista]] and the skull of [[Balerion]] which shuts off its jaws, then finally to the throne room, with the Lannister sigil revealing up and the [[Iron Throne]] emerging from the floor. [[Last Hearth]] first appears in the eighth season.

[[Image:Red Comet Title Sequence.png|thumb|right|200px|Relief detail depicting the Red Comet and the birth of Daenerys's dragons.]]
Unlike previous seasons, the eighth season's sequence also seems to be strictly abiding by the events of the show, therefore changing many aspects in the process. For example, the theme of sigils is present throughout previous sequences, but are removed in the latest version. The opening credits also clearly highlights [[House Lannister]]'s control of King's Landing, removing the sigil of [[House Baratheon]], despite [[Robert Baratheon]] being deceased since the first season (even more so when one considers [[House Baratheon of King's Landing]] and its effectiveness as a puppet of House Lannister).

==Conception==
The opening credits was created by Elastic, the company that previously created the opening credits for ''[[wikipedia:Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Big Love|Big Love]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Carnivale|Carnivale]]'' for [[HBO]]. The latter won them an Emmy Award.

The opening credits was inspired by the maps of Westeros that precede each novel in the series (and maps in fantasy novels in general). The creators decided to place the map on the inner surface of a sphere with an astrolabe-sun object at the center. The camera would then visit different parts of the map, while illustrations on the astrolabe covered some of the backstory to the series. The turning gears and cogs were meant to be reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's inventions.

As for why it is specifically an astrolabe with moving parts, producer [[Greg Spence]] explained that Angus Wall at Elastic came up with "a vision of a mad monk, in a tower somewhere," who was somehow keeping track of all this action, "and creating as he went. He would then fashion little automatons out of the materials that would be available in his world. They would be stone, or tin, or wood, and everything would feel very hand-crafted."<ref>[http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/why-doesnt-the-game-of-thrones-map-always-match-up-with-where-the-story-is]</ref>

==Rules==
In an interview during [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]], producer [[Greg Spence]] explained several rules about which locations appear in each episode's opening sequence. These rules explain '''why the map doesn't always match up exactly to what appears in the episode.'''<ref>[http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/why-doesnt-the-game-of-thrones-map-always-match-up-with-where-the-story-is]</ref>

'''First, as a rule, every episode's map must contain [[King's Landing]], [[Winterfell]], the [[Wall]], and "wherever [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] is at the moment" - ''even'' if Daenerys does not appear in that episode.''' The reason for this rule about Daenerys is because her locations outside of Westeros help show the vast sweep of the entire world, which is larger than just the one continent Westeros. If the camera simply panned up from King's Landing, to Winterfell, and then the Wall, it wouldn't really show much of the world at all. As Spence said:

:"The way the main title, and the way that the camera travels, and crossing the [[Narrow Sea]] into [[Essos]] is important to us, because it communicates the expanse of the show, and it helps to remind the audience of the entire world in which the show takes place. I think if we tried to limit the main title to just places that appear in the episodes, or we're literally tracing each character, it would be more confusing and less successful at its primary task, which is really orienting people to the world."<ref>[http://www.hitfix.com/whats-alan-watching/why-doesnt-the-game-of-thrones-map-always-match-up-with-where-the-story-is]</ref>

Winterfell also appears in every episode, even though during seasons 3 and 4 it was never physically visited. Again, this is to ground the most important parts of the world within the narrative: King's Landing is the capital city, the Wall is meant to hold back the return of the White Walkers, and Winterfell is the home of all the Starks.

'''Second, they don't always have the time and resources to create specific animations for every minor location - thus the ''capital'' of a region is often used as a stand-in to represent the overall territory.''' For example, at the beginning of Season 5 the Eyrie appears in the opening credits, even though [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] left it at the end of [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]]. Instead, they are at [[Runestone]], a major castle in the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. Even so, Spence explained, they didn't make a separate animation for Runestone, because it would only appear in that one episode and wasn't that important to the storyline as a whole, so it didn't justify the time and expense in creating an entirely new animation. Therefore, the Eyrie appears in that opening credits to represent the Vale as a whole, because it is the capital.

These budget constraints are also why they haven't made animations for many important locations which only appear once or twice: they have to skew their choices towards locations which they know are going to reappear more than once, so the money invested in producing each animation will get as much use as possible.

Pentos only appeared once in the first four seasons (and through Season 5 has been the rarest location), but it appeared in the first episode due to the rule that they need to show where Daenerys is.

'''Third, and perhaps most importantly, they can only show a limited number of locations in the 90 second duration of the opening sequence.''' The opening credits is never going to be delayed longer, in part due to the finite length of the opening theme song. As additional locations appear, some of the animations are being sped up to fit into the desired duration (most notably, in later versions of the opening credits usually only the last one from the original three takes of the Wall animation is being used). Added to this is the time it takes for the camera to zoom in and out, and pan across the globe, which can vary depending on which locations are in a single episode. The combined result is that through Season 5, no opening sequence has ever contained more than ''six'' locations, because there physically isn't enough time to fit more in (they ''might'' have more than six at a later point, if two are close together).

This became particularly notable in Season 5: up to that point, Daenerys (and her associated storyline) was the only major character not in Westeros (barring [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s one-episode trip to [[Braavos]] in Season 4). Starting in Season 5, however, other characters start traveling to the eastern continent, particularly [[Arya Stark]], [[Tyrion Lannister]], and [[Varys]]. Meanwhile, the TV series also physically visited [[Dorne]] for the first time, at the extreme southern end of Westeros - meaning it would take even longer for the camera to pan down to it. Also consider that each opening credits, as a rule, must show the Wall - which is on the exact opposite lengthwise side of the entire continent.

For example, in episode 5.2, besides the four constant locations (King's Landing, Winterfell, the Wall, and Daenerys in Meereen), the other major locations were Arya in Braavos, Tyrion in (the outskirts of) Pentos, the Eyrie for Sansa in the Vale, and the introduction of Dorne. This amounted to ''eight'' locations, and all at the far corners of the map, so there just wasn't enough time to zoom to each of them. Thus, the new Dorne animation could not debut in this episode, and the Pentos animation didn't reappear either. Greg Spence explained that they simply have to weigh how many motions the camera can physically make in a limited amount of time, and make tradeoffs relative to how important a location is in a given episode.

Similarly, in episode 5.3, in addition to the core four locations, both Sansa and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] went to [[Moat Cailin]], Arya was in Braavos, and Tyrion arrived at [[Volantis]]. While Volantis is an important location within the narrative and characters have discussed it throughout the TV series, it was the first time it had been physically visited, and they didn't know at the time if it would be revisited - meaning it didn't justify the expense of creating an entirely new Volantis-animation that would only get used once. It also would have involved a large amount of panning by the camera, because Braavos is the northernmost Free City and Volantis is the southernmost.

==Music==
The same musical piece, titled only "Main Title", is used in every version of the opening credits. Commonly called the "''Game of Thrones'' Theme", it opens with a string ostinato in C minor, quickly modulating to C major. A melodic variation over the ostinato then takes over on a solo cello. The alternation between minor and major continues throughout the entire piece. Its B section features a lyrical melody played by strings and later sung by a choir, supported by the main ostinato which is sustained throughout and never reaches a climax. The section ends on a crescendo leading into a light and short coda.

===Instrumentation===
Asked to avoid the use of flutes and solo violin, which the producers saw as a fantasy cliché, composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] prominently features the cello in this piece and in much of the other music of ''Game of Thrones''. It ends with a dulcimer (common in medieval music) and a kantele, a traditional Fenno-Karelian zither instrument. Djawadi uses these two instruments to create a sense of mystery and anticipation for the episode. In addition, Djawadi uses a standard strings section (violins 1 and 2, violas, cellos, basses) and a choir.

==Homages==
''[[wikipedia:The Simpsons|The Simpsons]]'' episode ''"Exit Through the Kwik-E-Mart"'' features a homage to the ''Game of Thrones'' opening credits, with famous buildings in the town of Springfield rising through the ground as characters watch on, dressed in ''Game of Thrones''-style costumes. The Wall is replaced by the monolithic "Couch" at the end of the sequence.<ref>[http://io9.com/5890410/watch-the-simpsons-game-of-thrones-intro io9]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*There are currently five episodes which feature a "cold open", where the opening scene is shown before the opening credits. These are:
**"[[Winter Is Coming]]" ([[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 1), depicting the "prologue" scene in which three [[Night's Watch]] rangers venture [[Beyond the Wall]] and encounter White Walkers.
**"[[Valar Dohaeris]]" ([[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]], Episode 1) which continues the [[fight at the Fist]] through the perspective of [[Samwell Tarly]].
**"[[Two Swords]]" ([[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]], Episode 1) in which [[Tywin Lannister]] melts down [[Ice]], the ancestral sword of [[House Stark]] and uses the [[Valyrian steel]] to forge [[Oathkeeper]] and [[Widow's Wail]].
**"[[The Broken Man]]" ([[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]], Episode 7) that's cold open reveals [[Sandor Clegane]], the Hound, is alive and in the [[Riverlands]].
**"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]" ([[Game of Thrones: Season 7|Season 7]], Episode 1) where [[Arya Stark]] poisons [[House Frey]] as vengeance for the [[Red Wedding]].
*In the original [[Pilot (Game of Thrones)|pilot]] script, the concept for the opening credits were to have a [[raven]] with a message flying from [[Castle Black]] in the north down to [[King's Landing]], revealing locations as it went, including the [[Wall]], [[Winterfell]], [[Moat Cailin]], the [[Kingsroad]], the [[Eyrie]] and the Riverlands before reaching the capital. The raven would then find itself in the empty throne room, pecking at the swords of the [[Iron Throne]].
*[[Sunspear]] in [[Dorne]] is introduced to the opening credits in [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]], but it was simply called "Dorne" rather than Sunspear specifically.
