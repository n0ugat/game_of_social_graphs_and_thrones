'''Acolyte'''{{Ref|H&L218}} is a title within the [[Alchemists' Guild]]. It is the middle rank within the order, above [[Apprentice]] and below [[Wisdom]].{{Ref|H&L218}}

Acolytes are tasked with preparing [[wildfire]], which the members of the Guild call "the Substance" in bare stone cells, using the order's secret arts and methods, which Wisdoms boast is "ancient magic". Should an Acolyte accidentally allow the wildfire to ignite, the ceiling of the cell is 'spelled' to collapse and release a large mass of sand to quell the fire - and bury the careless Acolyte alive.{{Ref|H&L218}}
