==Biography==
===Background===
Caraxes is ridden by Daemon Targaryen.{{Ref|HOTD101}} He has red scales, yellow eyes, a beard of horns, and wing-like membranes on his legs to support the aerodynamics of his body, which is long and serpentine in physique. He was named the "Blood Wyrm" by the [[Dragonkeepers]].<ref>[[:File:House Targaryen & Their Dragons - House of the Dragon - Max]]</ref>[[File:OT Daemon and Caraxes 2.png|thumb|250px|Daemon with Caraxes before leaving [[King's Landing]].]]
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
After Daemon is banished from [[King's Landing]] by [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]], he leaves on Caraxes with [[Mysaria]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

During a confrontation between Daemon and [[Otto Hightower]] at [[Dragonstone]], Caraxes shrieks and crawls forward to reveal himself at the top of a cliff, prompting Otto to order his men to sheathe their weapons.{{Ref|HOTD102}}
[[File:House-of-the-Dragon-Caraxes-on-the-Stepstones.jpg|thumb|Caraxes fighting in the Stepstones.]]
Caraxes is used by Daemon during the [[War for the Stepstones]]. Despite the distinct advantage a powerful dragon gives in battle, his effectiveness was suppressed by the caves along the coast of [[Bloodstone]], where [[Craghas Drahar]] and his soldiers retreated to. During one such night raid, Caraxes and Daemon ambush the Triarchy forces but can only cause minimal casualties when the Crabfeeder and his men hide from the dragonfire. Subsequently, numerous flaming arrows are fired at them, confusing Caraxes and wounding Daemon, forcing them to retreat.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

Several weeks later, at the Velaryon camp on Dwarfstone, [[Corlys Velaryon]], along with his son [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]] and brother [[Vaemond Velaryon|Vaemond]] discuss their situation as Caraxes and Daemon return from another dragonborne sortie against Drahar's stronghold.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Caraxes Concept Art.png|thumb|300px|Concept art of Caraxes by Constantine Sekeris closely resembles a loong, albeit with wings; a loong is usually depicted as a wingless serpent with four legs.]]
The visual design of Caraxes is inspired by a {{WPS|loong}} (Chinese dragon).<ref>''[[Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon: Inside the Creation of a Targaryen Dynasty]]''</ref>

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Caraxes was one of the older and larger dragons during the Dance of the Dragons. His scales were colored red, leading to him being called "the Blood Wyrm".

Caraxes's first rider was [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Aemon Targaryen]], the [[Prince of Dragonstone]] and King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]]'s eldest son and father of the princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]]. One of the fiercest dragons among the younger generation, he was given his nickname by the [[Dragonkeepers]], the order of guards created by King Jaehaerys to guard the newly-completed [[Dragonpit]], and later saw his first conflict during the Fourth Dornish War, when King Jaehaerys (astride [[Vermithor]]), Prince Aemon (astride Caraxes) and Prince Baelon, Aemon's younger brother (astride [[Vhagar]]), descended upon the Dornish fleet and destroyed it without suffering a single loss. Caraxes would later accompany Aemon to [[Tarth]] when an invasion of Myrish pirates caused the route of the Evenstar. However, Caraxes's fires drew the attention of the Myrish onto the Westerosi camp and a crossbowmen took a shot at the Evenstar, but missed and hit Aemon instead. The Prince of Dragonstone died of the wound, leaving Caraxes riderless until Daemon Targaryen, the younger son of Aemon's brother Baelon, claimed him.
