'''House Goodbrother'''{{Guideref|Great Wyk}} of [[Hammerhorn]] is a vassal house from the [[Iron Islands]] that holds fealty to [[House Greyjoy]]. Their seat is located in the [[Hardstone Hills]] of the island of [[Great Wyk]], the largest of the Iron Islands.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Goodbrother is one of the most powerful houses from Great Wyk. Their keep of Hammerhorn is inland, in the Hardstone Hills, and their wealth not coming from the sea but from their mines. Their blazon is a gold-banded black warhorn on red. Their current lord is Gorold Goodbrother.

[[Aeron Greyjoy]] has a certain disdain for the Goodbrothers, because their keep is far from the sea and due to the sources of their wealth.

House Goodbrother also has three cadet branches: House Goodbrother of Downdelving, House Goodbrother of Crow Spike Keep, and House Goodbrother of Corpse Lake.

House Goodbrother briefly ruled the Iron Islands as Iron Kings. After a King of House Greyiron died, his brother called a [[kingsmoot]] while the King's son, Torgon, was away. However, Urragon Goodbrother was chosen instead. Urragon then killed all of the late King's family, becoming known as "Badbrother".

However, Torgon returned after two years and declared the kingsmoot unlawful since he wasnt' present to put forth his candidacy, as was his right. Due to Urragon's cruelty, the [[ironborn]] and the [[Drowned Men]] rose against Urragon and raised Torgon to kingship.

In the fourth novel, Lord Gorold informs Aeron about [[Assassination of Balon Greyjoy|Balon's death]], and that Euron seized the Seastone Chair. The maester of the Goodbrothers claims that Theon is the rightful heir, but Aeron dismisses that scornfully, stating the ironborn are not bound to the Green land laws. At the kingsmoot, Gorold initially supports Victarion, but eventually votes for Euron.
