'''King of Salt and Rock'''{{Ref|H&L202}} is one of the self-styled titles held by the head of [[House Greyjoy]], ruler of the [[Ironborn]] and [[Lord of the Iron Islands]]. It is not a regal title, and the name of a lord bearing it is not prefixed by "King". It was first held by Lord [[Vickon Greyjoy]] and is currently held by Lady [[Yara Greyjoy]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the title is a reference to the ancient time in which each of the [[Iron Islands]] had a "salt king" and a "rock king," from which a "High King of the Isles" was elected in a [[kingsmoot]]. Both traditions were put to an end when Urron Greyiron descended on [[Nagga]]'s Hill on [[Old Wyk]] and slew all the other kings, taking the crown for himself and making the kingship of the Iron Isles hereditary.
