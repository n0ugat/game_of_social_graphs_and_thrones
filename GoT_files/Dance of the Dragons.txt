The '''Dance of the Dragons''',{{Ref|H&L403}} or simply the '''Dance of Dragons''',{{Ref|GOT509}} is a royal war of succession and civil war in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]] fought between two rival factions of [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]], the [[Blacks]] and the [[Greens]]. The war emerged as the culmination of a long-brewing succession crisis involving the two eldest children of the late [[Viserys I Targaryen]]: [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], his eldest daughter and named heir, and [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], his eldest son and heir based on traditional Andal succession law. Both claimants and their allies asserted they were the rightful successor to Viserys on the [[Iron Throne]]. Upon his death in [[132 AC]], the Blacks and Greens would crown their respective claimant and mobilize their forces for war. It is the first full-scale civil war in the history of the Seven Kingdoms.

==History==
===Prelude===
====A Princess of Dragonstone====
{{Quote|Here is the hard truth, which no one else has the heart to tell you. Men would sooner put the realm to the torch than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.|Rhaenys Targaryen to Rhaenyra Targaryen on the prospect of her becoming Queen|The Rogue Prince}}
In [[112 AC]], Queen [[Aemma Arryn]] tragically died during the birth of Prince [[Baelon Targaryen]], after [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] reluctantly ordered the child's delivery via cesarean section. Baelon would ultimately die himself shortly after, leaving the [[King]]'s brother, Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]], once again as the heir presumptive. However, after Daemon made a joke about the late prince's death, Viserys denied the [[Iron Throne]] from his rogue brother by controversially designating Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], his only surviving child by Aemma, as his heir.{{Ref|HOTD101}} In the months following the Queen's death, the [[House Velaryon|Velaryons]] and the [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightowers]] both sought Viserys's hand in marriage. Ultimately, Viserys chose to marry [[Alicent Hightower]], daughter of his [[Hand of the King|Hand]], Ser [[Otto Hightower]] over Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]]'s daughter, [[Laena Velaryon]].{{Ref|HOTD102}} Together, they had four children, the eldest of which was Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

[[File:OT Heir Rhaenyra.png|thumb|Rhaenyra now Princess of Dragonstone.]]
The [[Seven Kingdoms]] had never had a ruling queen before; Viserys himself was chosen as the heir to the throne over the elder Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] at the [[Great Council at Harrenhal]] in [[101 AC]], and many were troubled by the thought of Rhaenyra, a woman, ascending the throne.{{Ref|HOTD101}} The traditional inheritance laws of the [[Andals]] dictated that a younger son was ahead of an elder daughter in matters of succession, but the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryens]] had never formalized royal inheritance laws for their new realm after [[Aegon's Conquest]] 130 years prior. [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys I]] had inherited the throne on account of being the eldest of two sons, but both [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor I]] and [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]] took the throne by force,{{Ref|H&L806}} while Viserys I had been elected ahead of the most senior heir, Rhaenys.{{Ref|HOTD101}} Thus, all but one of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]'s successors had passed over what the Westerosi would consider to be the senior line, the most recent of which ostensibly established a precedent that a woman could not inherit the Iron Throne.{{Ref|HOTD102}}

====The Blacks and the Greens====
{{Dialogue a-b|Larys|The beacon on the Hightower, do you know what color it glows when Oldtown calls its banners to war?|Harwin|Green.|Larys and Harwin Strong|We Light the Way}}
[[File:TLOTT Criston, Aegon, Aemond, Helaena, Alicent & Otto.png|left|thumb|250px|The Greens rallied behind, Aegon, Viserys's eldest son, basing his claim on the widely-practiced precedent of male-preference primogeniture.]]
Upon Rhaenyra's proclamation as [[Prince of Dragonstone|Princess of Dragonstone]], Viserys extracted religious oaths of fealty to Rhaenyra from the lords of the realm.{{Ref|HOTD101}} However, after the birth of Aegon in [[113 AC]], many lords came to assume that he would succeed Viserys on the throne instead of Rhaenyra, as he was the king's firstborn son, a sentiment Otto would foster onto his daughter Alicent.{{Ref|HOTD103}} In the royal court at [[King's Landing]], tensions gradually rose between those who supported Viserys's and Rhaenyra's claim, and those who supported the Hightowers' claim for Aegon. These tensions not only split the court but also the royal family, as Rhaenyra and Alicent's deteriorating relationship and growing animosity was passed down to their children. Their hostility was heightened by the belief that Rhaenyra's children by her husband Ser [[Laenor Velaryon]] were, in fact, [[bastard]]s born out of wedlock with Ser [[Harwin Strong]].  This conflict ultimately led to the rise of two rival politcal factions: those who supported the Hightowers came to be known as the [[Greens]],{{Ref|HOTD107}} while Rhaenyra's own followers came to be known as the [[Blacks]].{{Ref|TDOD}}

[[File:TLOTT Daemon Jace Rhaenyra Luke and Rhaena Still.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Blacks rallied behind Rhaenyra, Viserys's firstborn child, and her claim based on Viserys's naming her his heir]]
The Blacks and Greens would compete for influence in Viserys's court for several years, amidst escalating tensions between the main branches of the royal family over the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's children.{{Ref|HOTD106}} In one instance, a fight broke out between Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] and several of Rhaenyra and Daemon's children that culminated in Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] maiming Aemond's eye in the backdrop of Laena's funeral. Dissatisfaction with how Viserys handled the situation led Alicent to openly confront Rhaenyra with the King's [[Valyrian steel dagger|dagger]], resulting in the princess's arm being slashed and their relationship all but shattered. Tensions were further inflamed when Rhaenyra remarried to her uncle Daemon shortly after Laenor's death, as part of an effort to strengthen her claim to the throne.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

When Rhaenyra departed with her family from King's Landing to her seat in Dragonstone in [[126 AC]], the Greens were largely left unopposed to expand their influence on the King and his court.{{Ref|HOTD106}} This was further cemented once Otto was reappointed as Viserys's Hand{{Ref|HOTD107}}, who subsequently began secretly conspiring with his allies on the Small Council to supplant Rhaenyra with Aegon in the line of succession once Viserys died.{{Ref|HOTD109}} As the King's health worsened, Otto began amassing greater power alongside Alicent. This culminated in the two effectively heading a regency once Viserys's illness left him bedridden and treatment with [[Milk of the poppy|milk of the poppy]] keeping him in a constant state of confusion. In their role as Hand and Queen respectively, the Greens effectively ruled and managed the realm in Viserys's stead, to the consternation of Rhaenyra and the Blacks.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

The principal Black and Green members of the royal family were briefly reconciled by a dying King Viserys during a family dinner in 132 AC. Viserys, however, would unintentionally undo his own efforts that same evening when he deliriously began telling Alicent of [[The Song of Ice and Fire|Aegon the Conqueror's dream]], believing he was talking to Rhaenyra. Confused, Alicent misinterpreted Viserys's dying rambles as him wishing for his son Aegon to succeed him. Alicent ultimately left Viserys for the night with this misconception, with the King passing away from his long-term illness shortly after.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

===Succession crisis===
====The Green coup====
{{Main|Coup in King's Landing}}
{{Dialogue a-b|Otto|With his last breath, he impressed upon the Queen his final wish that is son, Aegon, should succeed him as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.|Tyland|Then we may proceed now with the full assurance of his blessing on our long-laid plans.|Otto Hightower and Tyland Lannister initiating the coup|The Green Council}}
[[File:TGC Aegon II Coronation Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Greens crown Prince Aegon as Aegon II, plunging the realm into a succession crisis.]]
The morning after Viserys died, Otto assembled the late King's Small Council and informed them of his passing.{{Ref|HOTD108}} Shortly after, the [[Green Council]] was formed from it, with Otto and his allies [[coup in King's Landing|setting in motion their plan]] to take power and supplant Rhaenyra with Aegon. Lord [[Lyman Beesbury]], the Master of Coin, was the only one to speak up in protest against this action, denouncing it as treason and even going so far as to accuse them of regicide, but he was subsequently murdered (albeit accidentally) by Criston Cole. To delay the princess from learning of Viserys's death and in control of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] and [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|City Watch]], Otto had several lords and ladies of the royal court bend the knee to Aegon; only [[Lord Merryweather]] and [[Lady Fell]] refused to forswear their oaths and were subsequently imprisoned. Lord [[Allun Caswell]] attempted to warn Rhaenyra by pretending to bend the knee and then fleeing the city, but he was caught and publicly hanged. Princess Rhaenys was also placed under house arrest in her apartment in the Red Keep. To further consolidate power and legitimize Aegon's succession to the masses, the Greens swiftly moved to have the prince crowned before a large crowd in the [[Dragonpit]] as King Aegon II.{{Ref|HOTD109}} 

Despite the Greens concerted efforts, news of the king's death ultimately failed to be contain when Rhaenys was freed from her chambers by Ser [[Erryk Cargyll]]. Both subsequently fled King's Landing for Dragonstone during Aegon's coronation. Upon arrival, Rhaenys immediately informed Rhaenyra and Daemon of Viserys's death and the Greens' coronation of Aegon, urging the two to flee with their families from Dragonstone. In response, the [[Black Council]] was formed, with Daemon mobilizing the Black-allied lords and the garrison of Dragonstone to begin fortifying the island as Rhaenyra entered into labor. Following the funeral of her [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|sixth child]], Rhaenyra was crowned Queen by Daemon in front of her family and followers.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

====War of quills and ravens====
{{Quote|We've wasted precious days in this war of quills and ravens. Words are wind.|Aemond Targaryen|A Son for a Son}}
In the days following Rhaenyra and Aegon's coronation, the succession crisis deepened as several minor houses declared their support for either the Blacks or Greens, although no actual fighting had yet broken out. While the Greens held a numerical advantage in manpower, the Black held a numerical advantage in the number of dragons under their control. As such, both factions began making plans to rally the support of the [[Great House]]s.{{Ref|HOTD109}}{{Ref|HOTD110}} The Greens anticipated the backing of [[House Lannister/House of the Dragon|Houses Lannister]], [[House Tully/House of the Dragon|Tully]], and [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]],{{Ref|HOTD109}} while the Blacks expected the support of [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|Houses Stark]] and [[House Arryn/House of the Dragon|Arryn]]. Daemon plotted to treat with Lord [[Grover Tully]] to secure the [[Riverlands]] for their cause, while both councils also dispatched envoys to gain the backing of [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]].{{Ref|HOTD110}} 

In the interim, a final effort to avoid war between the Blacks and Greens occurred on Dragonstone, when a Green negotiation party headed by Otto arrived on the island. The party was met by Rhaenyra and Daemon, where Otto presented peace terms offered by Aegon II at the behest of the Dowager Queen: Rhaenyra's supporters would be pardoned and her children's rights to Dragonstone and Driftmark secured in exchange for abandoning her claim to the Iron Throne and swearing allegiance to Aegon II. Rhaenyra and Daemon denounced Otto and the peace terms, labeling Aegon II an usurper and the Greens traitors. Before a battle could break out, however, Rhaenyra agreed to consider the terms after Otto appealed to Rhaenyra's past friendship to Alicent and her desire for peace.{{Ref|HOTD110}} A day later, Lord Corlys Velaryon and his house declared their allegiance to Rhaenyra. With the backing of the Velaryon fleet and their control of the [[Stepstones]], the Blacks resolved to reject the Greens' terms. Instead, at Corlys' suggestion, the Velaryon fleet will blockade King's Landing while more allies are rallied to prepare for a siege of the capital. To that end, Rhaenyra's son Prince [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] was sent north on his dragon [[Vermax]] to secure the [[Eyrie]] and [[Winterfell]], while Lucerys traveled south to [[Storm's End]] on his dragon, [[Arrax]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

[[File:Vhagar kills Arrax.png|thumb|250px|right|Lucerys and Arrax’s death at the hands of Vhagar ended the possibility of a peaceful reconciliation between the Blacks and Greens.]]
At Storm's End, Lucerys found Prince Aemond already there ahead of him, having formed a marriage pact with Lord [[Borros Baratheon]]. Lacking a marriage proposal of his own and insulted at Rhaenyra's mere reminder for Borros to follow his [[Boremund Baratheon|father]]'s oath to her, Borros dismissed Lucerys from Storm's End, affirming House Baratheon's alignment with the Greens. As the young prince made his leave, Lucerys was soon after accosted by Aemond, demanding Lucerys cut out one of his eyes in revenge for his own. Lucerys refused and proceeded to flee Storm's End on Arrax amidst a violent storm, with Aemond giving chase atop his dragon [[Vhagar]]. A [[Fight above Shipbreaker Bay|fight]] ensued above [[Shipbreaker Bay]] between the two princes' dragons, resulting in the deaths of both Lucerys and Arrax, much to Aemond's dismay.  When news of Lucerys's death reached Dragonstone, Rhaenyra was consumed by rage and grief, all but ensuring open war between the Blacks and Greens.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===War of fire and blood===
{{Quote|The dragons dance, and men are like dust beneath their feet.|Criston Cole|The Queen Who Ever Was}}

====A son for a son====
In the days following Lucerys's death, the realm continued to enjoy a tense and tenuous peace as both the Blacks and Greens furthered their efforts of amassing support in preparation for the now inevitable conflict while continuing to avoid open hostilities. Whilst awaiting responses of allegiance from Houses Baratheon, Stark, and Arryn, the Greens began looking towards securing the vital [[Riverlands]], with both Houses Lannister and Hightower mobilizing their banners in the [[Westerlands]] and [[Reach]] respectively for a push towards the region in the coming weeks.{{Ref|HOTD201}} Meanwhile, the Blacks' [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]] of the [[Gullet]] was now firmly in place, shutting down all seaborne trade into and out of King's Landing and placing the city under increasing strain, forcing the Greens to consider either expand their own naval forces or form an alliance with the [[Ironborn]] (via offering Lord [[Dalton Greyjoy]] the post of [[Master of Ships]]) to break the blockade. The Greens would be dealt a diplomatic blow, however, when both the [[North]] and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] sided with the Blacks. Due to the efforts of Prince Jacaerys, Lord [[Cregan Stark]] agreed to supply 2,000 Northern men, all experienced and battle-ready, for Rhaenyra's cause, while Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]] hinged the support of her house on the agreement that the Blacks supplied a dragon to protect the Vale from Green reprisals.{{Ref|HOTD201}} The Greens are dealt a further blow when a sworn vassal of the Hightowers, [[House Beesbury]], enraged by the murder of their lord in the Hightower-backed coup, raise arms in support of Rhaenyra and defiance of their liege lord and begin attacking the Hightower armies as they march, severely hampering them.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Still grieving over her late son, Rhaenyra was largely unresponsive to the positive developments for her cause. After prowling for days along the coasts of the [[Stormlands]] for signs of Lucerys atop [[Syrax]], she would return to Dragonstone and her council with the singular demand of wanting her half-brother, Aemond Targaryen.{{Ref|HOTD201}} Daemon, already possessing a strong desire of vengeance against his nephew, decides to honor the Queen's wish. Initially attempting to enlist Rhaenys and [[Meleys]] to lead an assault on Vhagar to kill her and Aemond, after he is rebuffed, Daemon instead clandestinely heads to King's Landing on his own. There, he enlists a [[Blood|loyal City Watch guard]] of his during his time as Lord Commander and a [[Cheese|rat-catcher]] with extensive knowledge of the Red Keep's secret tunnels for a singular mission: assassinate Aemond Targaryen. The two proceed to infiltrate the castle under the cover of performing rat-catching duties, eventually making their way to the royal apartments. Unable to locate Aemond, the duo settled on their secondary objective after stumbling upon Queen [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]]: Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]]. Held at knifepoint, Helaena attempted to bribe the duo into sparing her son, but when this failed, she is ultimately forced to point out which of her children with her is Jaehaerys. Helaena would flee her chambers to safety with Princess [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]] as the assassins [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murdered]] and beheaded Jaehaerys in his bed.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

====Moves and countermoves====
Prince Jaehaerys's sudden death sent shockwaves amongst the Greens, with the Green Council, upon receiving the horrible news, immediately ordering the Red Keep and the city to be placed under lockdown. The Kingsguard and City Watch were tasked with a sweeping search of both the castle and the city, hoping to locate the assassins. Despite these measures, Blood and Cheese managed to escape, with Cheese returning to the city incognito. Blood, on the other hand, attempted to flee King's Landing with the Prince's head in a sack, in an effort to claim his reward from Daemon and escape the impending justice for his crime.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

As the Green Council deliberated over the young Prince's death, Aegon made it clear to the council that Rhaenyra was to blame and intended to declare war on the Blacks immediately. Lord [[Larys Strong]] then arrived to inform the council that Blood had been detained at one of the gates of King's Landing in possession of Jaehaerys's head. Aegon, furious over his son's death, declared his intent to execute Blood personally, but Lord [[Jasper Wylde]] urged restraint, suggesting to interrogate Blood first for information. Ser Otto added that the Greens could turn the terrible incident to their advantage by manipulating public sentiment. He proposed having ravens sent out blaming Rhaenyra and holding a public funeral for Jaehaerys to earn the sympathy of the [[smallfolk]] in King's Landing. Aegon initially refused, disgusted at the thought of turning his son's death into a spectacle, but Alicent managed to convince Aegon to allow it. In his place, Alicent and Helaena would ride behind the funeral procession as it made its way to the Dragonpit.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

As news of Jaehaerys's death spread throughout the realm, the Blacks were left flat-footed once it reached Dragonstone, and that they, specifically Rhaenyra, were being blamed for it. Rhaenyra was shocked at the allegations, ordering ravens of their own to be sent denying her involvement. Despite this, Rhaenyra's advisor on her small council made it clear that the incident heavily damaged the Black's reputation and position, and it would not be easy to recover. Rhaenyra would confront Daemon over his involvement, to which he freely admitted he was responsible. The two engaged in a heated argument, with Rhaenyra questioning Daemon's loyalty to her and her resulting lack of trust in him now. Meanwhile, Jaehaerys's funeral successfully earned the sympathy of King's Landing's populace as Otto intended, with the Greens ensuring the smallfolk were made aware that Rhaenyra was responsible for the Prince's death. Later, unbeknownst to the Green Council, Criston ordered Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]] to infiltrate Dragonstone, impersonating his brother, Erryk, with the objective of assassinating Rhaenyra.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

After Larys interrogated Blood and the revelation that his accomplice was a ratcatcher, Aegon ordered all ratcatchers in the Red Keep's employ to be hanged and publicly displayed throughout King's Landing, Cheese amongst them. Otto lambasts Aegon for his rash actions, explaining that their hard-earned sympathy from Jaehaerys's funeral was all but erased, replaced by the scorn and hatred of the ratcatcher's families. Aegon insists he wants blood instead of ink, to which Otto insults Aegon for lacking Viserys's virtues and finishes by saying his father never wanted him to be king. Aegon promptly dismisses Otto as his hand and appoints Criston as his replacement. Meanwhile, on Dragonstone, Arryk successfully infiltrates the Black stronghold as his brother and reaches Rhaenyra's chambers. Before he can harm Rhaenyra, however, Erryk enters the room, and the two engage in a [[Duel on Dragonstone|ferocious battle]] that ended in both brothers' deaths.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

====Opening engagements====
[[File:Battle of the Burning Mill.png|thumb|left|250px|The Burning Mill was the first battle between houses supporting the Blacks and the Greens.]]
{{Quote|Harrenhal is a useful morass. It will keep Daemon well-occupied while we strengthen our host and weaken Rhaenyra's support on the mainland. We will deal with it in the Riverlands in time. But right now, Rook's Rest is an easy target.|Aemond Targaryen explaining his strategy to the Green Council|The Red Dragon and the Gold}}
[[File:Cole's army leaves his campaign..png|thumb|Cole's army leaves for the campaign.]]
Jaehaerys's death accelerated the polarization the Seven Kingdoms faced between the two factions, increasing tensions amongst rival houses. Among these was the Green-aligned [[House Bracken|Brackens]] and Black-aligned [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]], whose centuries long-feud erupted into [[Battle at the Burning Mill|open-battle]] over a border dispute near what was now known as the [[Burning Mill]]. During a Green Council meeting, Aegon was quick to declare this a victory when it was revealed the Brackens had struck first and had slain Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]]. However, the heavy losses sustained on both sides cast doubt on this position. With a Hightower army marching north still months away and the Lannisters still raising an army in the Westerlands, Criston proposed that he raise an army in King's Landing and march on the Riverlands immediately, with the goal of subduing Black-aligned houses in the [[Crownlands]] to grow an army for Harrenhal. To that end, Criston departed King's Landing with an army of Targaryen and Hightower knights alongside Alicent's brother, Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]]. However, the Blacks were made aware of Criston's movements when Lady [[Baela Targaryen]] spotted and harassed Criston's forces moving towards [[Rosby]] atop [[Moondancer]], forcing Criston to march at night under tree cover to mask his movements from the Blacks. The Blacks, meanwhile, achieved a significant victory thanks to Daemon's effort, who subdued Harrenhal with ease when its castellan, Ser [[Simon Strong]], [[Taking of Harrenhal|surrendered the castle without a fight]]. With Harrenhal under his control, Daemon resolved to rebuild the castle and treat with Lord [[Grover Tully]] in order to bring the Riverlands and its houses into the Blacks' fold.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Retaining a strong desire to avoid adverse destruction and loss of life, Rhaenyra remained noncommittal to the use of her dragons, much to the dismay of her small council, who continued to urge strongly for the Blacks to act. Believing peace could still be achieved without bloodshed, Rhaenyra approached Mysaria over her contacts within King's Landing and asked if she knew of Alicent's movements. Mysaria revealed that the Queen Dowager regularly visits the [[Grand Sept]] for prayer, alone. Using this information, Rhaenyra, alongside her [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander of the Queensguard]], Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]], embarked on a covert mission into the capital disguised as a [[septa]] and [[septon]], respectively, of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. Once there, Rhaenyra infiltrated the Grand Sept and approached Alicent, much to her shock. Rhaenyra discussed their joint desire for peace with Alicent and asked if there was still a path towards it. Alicent rebuked Rhaenyra, claiming she had no army and was losing allies after Jaehaerys's assassination. Rhaenyra denies her involvement in the incident and states that Alicent had still yet to answer for Lucerys's death and the usurpation of her birthright, to which Alicent denies responsibility and replies that Viserys had changed his mind about her being his successor. Rhaenyra decries Alicent's statement as lies, but Alicent remains steadfast on Viserys's last-minute change to the line of succession, much to Rhaenyra's dismay. When Rhaenyra asks what Viserys's final words were, Alicent states that Viserys, despite his confusing rambles, mentioned Aegon's name and said he was the [[Prince That Was Promised]]. Realizing the true meaning of Viserys's dying words, Rhaenyra explains to Alicent that Viserys was talking about [[Aegon the Conqueror]] and the Song of Ice and Fire, not her son. As the magnitude of her misinterpretation sets in, Alicent, nevertheless, states that no mistake was made and urges Rhaenyra to leave before she is caught. Rhaenyra implores Alicent that peace could still be achieved, but Alicent remarks that it is too late for that now as she no longer has the power to sway the Greens from war now that her father has been dismissed as Hand and with Criston on the march. She promptly leaves Rhaenyra in the sept, alone and defeated.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

[[File:TRDATG Duskendale.jpg|thumb|right|250px|With the fall of Duskendale and House Darklyn's defection to the Greens, the Blacks' holdings on the mainland were substantially eroded.]]
With the civil war in full swing, the Greens achieved the first few victories of the conflict as Criston's army marched through the Crownlands, gaining Houses [[House Rosby|Rosby]] and [[House Stokeworth|Stokeworth]] as allies when they [[Submission of Rosby|willingly]] [[Submission of Stokeworth|submitted]] to his army and added their forces to it. However, when his army reached [[Duskendale]],  [[House Darklyn]] remained defiant to the Greens demands. This prompted Criston's army to lay siege to Duskendale, [[Sack of Duskendale|sacking the port town]], and capturing Lord [[Gunthor Darklyn]]. The remains of House Darklyn promptly swore allegiance to the Greens after Criston executed Lord Gunthor, with the Green army subsequently marching north towards [[Rook's Rest]] after Criston received new orders from Aemond. When the Blacks learned of Criston's massing forces near Rook's Rest from Lord [[Simon Staunton]], they debated on how and who they would send to repel the impending attack. It was then that Rhaenyra returned from her mission in King's Landing. After informing her small council of the purpose of her meeting with Alicent and her newfound resolve to win the conflict militarily, Rhaenyra volunteered to assist the Stauntons herself atop [[Syrax]]. The suggestion was protested by her son, Jacaerys, who volunteered himself and Vermax to go instead. Rhaenyra declined Jacaerys offer, however, citing his lack of battle experience, to which Rhaenys proposed she go to Rook's Rest instead, noting to Rhaenyra that [[Meleys]] had significant experience in battle, a suggestion Rhaenyra acceded to.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

[[File:Sunfyre and Meleys fight.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Battle at Rook's Rest was the first clash between the Blacks and Greens' dragons.]]
Rhaenys and Meleys flew for Rook's Rest, arriving just as the Green army was making progress in their [[Battle at Rook's Rest|assault]] on the Staunton's castle. As Meleys devastated the Green army with multiple strafings of dragonfire, Criston sprung his trap, alerting a hidden Aemond and Vhagar deep in the forest to join the battle. Before he could, Aegon and [[Sunfyre]] unexpectedly joined the fray, much to Aemond's anger and Criston's shock. Despite Aegon's efforts, however, Sunfyre was brutalized by Meleys, who dominated their struggle against one another before Aemond's intervention with Vhagar left the king and his mount in critical condition. With Aegon incapacitated, Rhaenys directed Meleys to attack Vhagar, with the two massive dragons clashing high above the battlefield. Ultimately, Meleys was outmatched by Vhagar, and she and Rhaenys were killed near the end of the battle. The remains of the Green army, led by Ser Gwayne, would use the breach created by Meleys's body to capture Rook's Rest. The first engagement of the Dance involving dragons was an extremely costly victory for the Greens. The army assembled from Criston's campaign in the Crownlands was shattered, while Aegon was left critically injured for meager gains. Meanwhile, the Blacks sustained a devastating defeat, losing Meleys, their largest claimed dragon, alongside her rider, Rhaenys, an experienced dragonrider and crucial member of Rhaenyra's small council.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

{{Quote|Then the storm broke, and the dragons danced.|Archmaester Gyldayn|Fire & Blood}}
The Dance of the Dragons has been mentioned as a historical event since the first of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels. [[George R.R. Martin]] later began writing a series of prequel novellas describing the war, written as in-universe history books, not POV character prose like the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series or the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]].

The Dance split the Seven Kingdoms in two, as lords, knights, and smallfolk declared for one side or the other. House Targaryen itself was divided, when the kin of each claimant became embroiled in the fighting. Over the two years of struggle, a terrible toll was taken on the highborn and smallfolk of Westeros alike. 

The Dance was a war unlike any other ever fought before or afterwards in the long history of the Seven Kingdoms: armies met in savage battles, but much of the slaughter took place on water, and especially in the air, as dragons fought dragons. It was a war marked by stealth, murder, and betrayal as well, a war fought in shadows and stairwells, council chambers and castle yards with knives and lies and poison.

Aegon II's main supporters were his mother Alicent's family, the powerful [[House Hightower]] that rules [[Oldtown]]. Rhaenyra's main supporters were her first husband's family, [[House Velaryon]], as well as her mother's family, [[House Arryn]]. The rivalry between Rhaenyra on one side and Alicent on the other festered at the royal court for years during the reign of Viserys I. One way this rivalry took shape was in the fashions of clothing that courtiers wore, to display their faction allegiance. Once at a major tournament Rhaenyra wore a black and red gown, the colors of House Targaryen, while Alicent wore a green gown (in the TV series, green is one of the Hightower colors. In the books this is not the case; Alicent simply preferred to wear green). Soon, all of Rhaenyra's supporters started wearing black clothing, while all of Alicent's followers started wearing green. Over the years, the popular names applied to both factions were inspired by the colors they wore: Rhaenyra's supporters were called "the [[blacks]]," and Aegon II's supporters were called "the [[greens]]."

The Dance of the Dragons draws inspiration from the real-life civil war in medieval England known as the "{{WPS|The Anarchy|Anarchy}}," when Princess Matilda was the only child of King Henry I, but her cousin Stephen usurped the throne, leading to nineteen years of protracted civil war. Similarly, Matilda was unpopular because she was thought to be imperious and domineering for a woman.

===Teora Toland's dream===
In a sample chapter of ''The Winds of Winter'', Arianne Martell ([[Doran Martell|Doran]]'s elder daughter and heir) travels to meet the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]] and [[Jon Connington]], who have recently arrived at Westeros with the [[Golden Company]] and requested Dorne's support. On her way, Arianne arrives at [[Ghost Hill]], the seat of House Toland; Teora, Lady Toland's younger daughter, tells Arianne that she had a dream about dragons "''They were dancing. In my dream. And everywhere the dragons danced the people died''."{{Bookref|TWOW|Arianne I}} It has yet to be seen whether Teora's dream is about the war that happened in the past, or about the upcoming war (nicknamed by fans "Dance of the Dragons 2.0") which may occur in the next unpublished novels between the two Targaryen contenders, Daenerys and her nephew.
