The '''Frozen Shore'''{{Ref|H&L410}} is the name given to the northern coastline of the [[Bay of Ice]], located [[beyond the Wall]] in the far northwest of [[Westeros]]. It is inhabited by [[Free Folk|wildlings]]. It is separated from the [[Haunted Forest]] and the [[Wall]] by the mountain range known as the [[Frostfangs]]. The [[Skirling Pass]] links the Haunted Forest to the Frozen Shore. The [[Land of Always Winter]] lies to the north.

The Frozen Shore is one of the few places that is both beyond the Wall, and also geographically south of it at its southern tip simultaneously.

The snows are so deep on the Frozen Shore, and there is so little plant life, that the [[Free Folk|wildling]] tribes that live there travel about by riding in sleds made from walrus bones, and pulled by packs of [[dog]]s.<ref>"[[The Nations of the North]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Frozen Shore is inhabited by clans of warriors who ride chariots made out of walrus bone and pulled by dogs. The clans of the Frozen Shore warred incessantly with the [[ice-river clans]] to their north, until the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], [[Mance Rayder]], negotiated a truce. Frozen Shore warriors now fight in his army.

The men of the Frozen Shore aren't too isolated from the other wildling tribes, despite living on the west side of the Frostfangs, because they can move along the coast to bypass the mountains. Still, the lands they live in are harsh, and they survive mostly on resources from the sea.

In the past, raiders from the Frozen Shore have raided [[Bear Island]] to the south.
