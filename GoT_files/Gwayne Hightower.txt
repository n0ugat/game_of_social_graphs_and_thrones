Ser '''Gwayne Hightower''' is a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|House Hightower]] and the eldest son of Ser [[Otto Hightower]]. He is a brother of [[Alicent Hightower]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Gwayne grew up in [[Oldtown]], while his father [[Otto Hightower|Otto]], mother [[Alyrie Florent|Alyrie]], and younger sister [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] left to live at the [[Red Keep]] when he was eight years old.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Gwayne Hightower.png|thumb|200px|left|Gwayne at the Heir's Tournament.]]
Ser Gwayne travels to [[King's Landing]] to compete in the [[Heir's Tournament]]. Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] chooses him as his first opponent in the jousting competition as an insult to his father Ser [[Otto Hightower|Otto]]. Gwayne has the better of Daemon in the first tilt knocking him backwards but on the second Daemon aims his lance low, taking out his horse's legs and throwing Gwayne from the saddle, injuring his face.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Ser Gwayne travels from Oldtown to King's Landing at the behest of his sister, Dowager Queen [[Alicent Hightower]]. He arrives at the capital shortly after their father has been replaced as [[Hand of the King]] by Ser [[Criston Cole]], [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] of his nephew's [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]], with Alicent insisting Cole allow Gwayne to accompany him on his march to secure [[Harrenhal]]. Gwayne makes several backhanded insults to Cole's parentage and lack of fitness for his new post before departing.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Several days later, Cole intercepts Gwayne and several of his companions as they make for an inn, rather than camp with the main army. As Gwayne defends his intentions, Cole notices they are exposed on open ground, before spotting Lady [[Baela Targaryen]] atop her [[dragon]] [[Moondancer]] circling above them. Cole orders the group to make for the forest nearby, and Gwayne and his companions hastily obey, reaching the treeline just ahead of a diving Moondancer, who breaks off her attack. The group nervously waits until Baela leaves, after which a chastened Gwayne thanks Cole for saving his life. Cole berates him for giving away their presence to the [[Blacks]] and insists there will be no further stopping at inns for Gwayne.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

As the campaign continues, Cole, Gwayne and their army travel by night to hide from the Blacks dragons. They reach [[Castle Stokeworth]] and [[Rosby]], and the lords of both castles swear fealty to king Aegon. However, lord [[Gunthor Darklyn]] of [[Duskendale]] refuse to bend his knee to the Green cause, leading to a battle where Gwayne fights alongside Cole. In the aftermath, he witnesses as Cole executes lord Darklyn.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Gwayne and Cole later reach [[Rook's Rest]], where they make camp while preparing to assault the castle. Cole decides to launch the attack in broad daylight, despite Gwayne protesting that they will easily be spotted and destroyed by one of Rhaenyra's dragons. As the attack commences, Gwayne surveys the battle alongside Cole, and watches as [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] arrives on [[Meleys]] to defend Rook's Rest. He then spots king Aegon arriving on [[Sunfyre]] and berates Cole, thinking that risking the kings life in battle is part of his plan. Soon afterwards, prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] joins the fray on [[Vhagar]] and the fight eventually causes both Sunfyre and Meleys to fall from the sky. Meleys crashes into Rook's Rest, killing Rhaenys and breaching the wall. Gwayne seizes the opening to rally the Green soldiers and take the castle while Cole goes to look for the fallen king.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Gwayne, Cole and their army later return to King's Landing, where they parade the head of the dead Meleys through the streets, to the horror of the citizens. When Cole asks if the people realize that the Green won the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]], Gwayne questions if it really was a victory.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Aemond, now appointed Prince Regent later sends Cole out into field yet again, with Gwayne once more set to accompany him. Before leaving, Gwayne speaks to Alicent, who asks whether Gwayne has heard anything from Otto, which he hasn't. She also inquires about her son [[Daeron Targaryen]] who is a ward in Oldtown. Gwayne assures her that he is a good and skilled young man, before leaving King's Landing with Ser Criston.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

While encamped in the field, Gwayne brandishes his sword and confronts Cole over his relationship with Alicent, and accuses him of breaking his vows as a Kingsguard. Cole doesn't excuse his actions, and only questions whether anything men do really matters in the face of a war between dragons. This silences Gwayne, who puts away his sword and sits down next to Cole.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Personality==
Gwayne is arrogant,{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }} sarcastic, and outspoken. Gwayne also disrespects Criston Cole due to being the son of a steward, constantly mocking him despite having become Hand of the King.{{Ref|HOTD203}} He is a capable leader in battle.{{Ref|HOTD204}} Gwayne knows that Alicent is their father's favourite but does not resent her for it. He instead tries to reach out to her and is shown to deeply care for his family. Freddie Fox, his actor, describes him as "someone who was raised with a bit of a silver spoon in his mouth and was a little quick to judge initially but as (...) battle completely breaks him down, he becomes a very human, kind person."

==Behind the scenes==
Gwayne first appears in the series premiere, portrayed by stunt performer [[Will Willoughby]] in a jousting match against Daemon Targaryen.<ref>''[[Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon: Inside the Creation of a Targaryen Dynasty]]''</ref> He has no speaking lines and appears helmetless only very briefly.

On April 24, 2023, [[HBO]] announced that [[Freddie Fox]] had been cast in the role of Gwayne Hightower for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]].{{Webref|name=Variety |author=Jordan Moreau |date=April 24, 2023 |url=https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-alys-rivers-season-2-1235592500/ |title=‘House of the Dragon’ Season 2 Casts Alys Rivers and Three More Characters |website=Variety |access-date=April 25, 2023 }} His character description reads as follows:
:''"An arrogant knight from Oldtown who is the son of Otto Hightower and Queen Alicent’s brother."''<ref name="WBD" />

Freddie Fox is from a prominent multi-generational family of actors. His mother, [[Joanna David]], portrayed [[Joselyn Redwyne]] in the first season of ''House of the Dragon''.

==In the books==
In the ''[[Fire and Blood]]'', Ser Gwayne Hightower is said to be the youngest of Alicent's brothers, rather than the eldest.

In 129 AC, Gwayne was named the second-in-command of the [[City Watch of King's Landing]], following the Greens' coup and Aegon II's crowning. He and Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]] escorted Grand Maester [[Orwyle]] when he traveled to Dragonstone, delivering Aegon II's terms of peace to Rhaenyra.
