'''Selhorys'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a town in western [[Essos]], located on the eastern bank of the [[Rhoyne]]. The town is located north of [[Volantis]] and [[Valysar]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels Selhorys is a settlement under the rule of Volantis. It is located at the confluence of the Rhoyne and the Selhoru. It pays tribute to passing [[Dothraki]] ''[[khalasar]]s'', which can easily reach the city from the western-most edge of the [[Dothraki Sea]], which is located not far to the east of the settlement. By the standards of the [[Free Cities]], Selhorys is a middling-sized town, although by the standards of [[Westeros]] it would be a large city.

The events that transcur in Volantis in the TV series take place in Selhorys, most notably [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] being kidnapped by [[Jorah Mormont]], who then does take him to Volantis.
