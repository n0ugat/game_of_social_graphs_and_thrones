The '''Lord of Storm's End'''{{Ref|GOT804}} is the ruler of the stronghold of [[Storm's End]], the capital of the [[Stormlands]]. The holder is ruler of the entire region of the Stormlands. The current Lord of Storm's End is [[Gendry Baratheon]].

==History==
===Background===
The Stormlands were originally a sovereign nation known as ''The Storm Kingdom'' until [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] arrived in [[Westeros]] and formed the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Aegon Targaryen sent his bastard brother [[Orys Baratheon]] to secure the Stormlands, making him the first Lord of Storm's End.

Former holder [[Robert Baratheon]] passed the title to his infant brother, [[Renly Baratheon]] after he became the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]] following [[Robert's Rebellion]]. This has left [[Stannis Baratheon]] with issues of resentment towards Robert since he feels as though he should have been the Lord of Storm's End as Renly's older brother. Instead, Stannis was given control of the traditional seat of the Targaryen heirs. Before Robert, his father [[Steffon Baratheon]] was Lord of Storm's End.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
During the [[War of the Five Kings]], the red priestess [[Melisandre]] uses her magic to create a [[shadow]] to kill King Renly. Following Renly's death, Stannis took Storm's End as his own, making him the Lord of Storm's End.<ref>"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"</ref> As Stannis was ostensibly rebelling against the crown, his claim to the title was disputed by the incumbent King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], who as Robert's legal son (his actual status as a bastard with no Baratheon blood notwithstanding) also claimed the title.

In the aftermath of Stannis's defeat at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], where several houses of the Stormlands became extinguished, the Stormlands descended into chaos, as some houses, attempting to curry favor with the victorious [[House Lannister|Lannister]] regime, began seizing lands from those that remained loyal to Stannis's cause.<ref>"[[The Stormlands]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The forces of Houses Lannister and [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] have fully consolidated control of the Stormlands in the name of King Joffrey, presumably making him the Lord of Storm's End.<ref name="KF">A map in "[[Kissed by Fire]]" shows Lannister and Tyrell map markers in the Stormlands, and no Baratheon map markers.</ref> Stannis presumably continues to claim the title.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's death]], his titles, presumably including that of Lord of Storm's End, are inherited by his younger brother, [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]].<ref>"[[The Lion and the Rose]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Stannis is [[Battle in the ice|defeated at Winterfell]] and killed by [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]].<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref> His death makes Tommen the undisputed Lord of Storm's End.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Tommen commits suicide after the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]].<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref> With no remaining trueborn Baratheon heirs, the title of Lord of Storm's End becomes vacant.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
At the feast following the [[Battle of Winterfell]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] questions the current status of Storm's End's lordship. She then decides to [[Legitimization|legitimize]] [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] as a Baratheon, and names him Lord of Storm's End.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref> This is upheld by the lords of Westeros after [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|her assassination]], as Gendry is a participant at a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]].<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>
