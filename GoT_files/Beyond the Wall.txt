'''Beyond the Wall'''{{Ref|GOT102}} and '''north of the Wall'''{{Ref|GOT103}} are generic terms employed by the people of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]] and the [[North|Kingdom of the North]] to refer to the large area of [[Westeros]] that lies north of the [[Wall]]. It is the only part of the continent that is not part of a realm, and thus the only place where particular attention is given to the difference between "Westeros" (the continent), and "the Six Kingdoms" and the Kingdom of the North (the two realms to the south of the Wall).

It is inhabited by tribes that refer to themselves as the "[[Free Folk]]", known by the people of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]] as wildlings. The wildlings themselves are not politically unified but consist of numerous and diverse groups. Many are semi-nomadic hunters, due to the impracticality of agriculture in the far north. Some wildlings are little more than savage and primitive raiders, but other groups live in small settled communities and villages.

The Free Folk sometimes refer to these lands as "the real North", because they are actually located north of the northernmost kingdom of Westeros, which is named simply "the [[North]]" - and they think it odd to say that "the north" is ''south'' of where they live.

==Geography==

{{Dialogue a-b|Davos Seaworth|This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the Seven Kingdoms.|Mance Rayder|We're not ''in'' the Seven Kingdoms.|Mance points out that the lands beyond the Wall might be on the same continent, but they are not part of the Seven Kingdoms.|The Children}}
The lands beyond the Wall are mostly uncharted. The region immediately north of the Wall includes the [[Haunted Forest]], a vast taiga-forest which covers most of the area, extending from the Wall to the furthest uncharted north.

The forest extends from the eastern coast to a large mountain chain in the west known as the [[Frostfangs]]. The Frostfangs extend an unknown distance to the north and are quite inhospitable. However, there are rumors that even the northern Frostfangs contain hidden valleys, heated by volcanic activity, which are actually the most hospitable regions north of the Wall, and heavily settled by the wildlings.

Southwest of the Frostfangs there is a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the sea known as the [[Frozen Shore]], a harsh area inhabited by fierce and primitive warriors who frequently cross the [[Bay of Ice]] to raid the lands in the [[North]] sworn to [[House Stark]]. This small area is totally enclosed by the Frostfangs, which run southeast to northwest, and the ocean.

Beyond all of these areas, in the furthest north are the [[Land of Always Winter]]. The forest ends and gives way to these truly polar regions, which are unexplored. The [[White Walkers]] are rumored to originate in the depths of the Land of Always Winter.

==Economy==

The [[Free Folk]] living north of the [[Wall]] have a hardscrabble, survival-based economy, with little settled agriculture. Most of their economic activity is fixated on hunting and gathering: they live to catch what they can eat, and they eat whatever they can catch. They use no official [[Money|currency]], as they are more interested in obtaining things that are directly useful to them, and thus function on the barter system.<ref>"[[The North Remembers]]"</ref>

However, the wildlings do engage in at least some long-distance trade: the heavy furs of local animals adapted to the harsh cold of the extreme north are fairly valuable, and they often trade them to passing smuggler ships in exchange for iron weapons, which they cannot forge on their own. In past centuries the Night's Watch tried to stop the fur-for-iron trade along the coasts, but in recent centuries as their numbers dwindled they abandoned any attempts to prevent passage around the Wall by sea.

==In the books==

Author [[George R.R. Martin]] has stated that the land-area inhabited by the Free Folk beyond the Wall is vast, roughly the size of Canada: "There's actually quite a lot of Westeros north of the Wall, it's a large expanse of land, probably as large as Canada."<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/03/new-s3-video-inside-the-wildlings/ HBO Behind-the-scenes featurette], Game of Thrones Season 3: Inside the Wildlings"</ref>

''The World of Ice and Fire'' companion book features a map of Westeros and western Essos that shows a significant amount of land north of the Wall, possibly extending further east and west as well, backing up the suggestion that the lands beyond the Wall are vast.<ref>[http://24.media.tumblr.com/ddd579fdf10fb72658d43f003dd62bb4/tumblr_n5igo1nnHW1sybxk4o3_1280.png ''The World of Ice and Fire'' preview]</ref>
