'''Wallen'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a deserter from the [[Night's Watch]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Wallen is a deserter of the Night's Watch who has fled south with [[Stiv]], a fellow deserter, and [[Osha]], a [[Free Folk|wildling]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Stiv, Osha, and Wallen flee south of the Wall, apparently in fear of the return of the [[White Walkers]]. In the woods near [[Winterfell]] they stumble across [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and decide to steal his horse. Realizing his importance, they ponder taking him prisoner and returning him to [[Mance Rayder]], the king-beyond-the-wall, for a reward, but decide against it. [[Robb Stark|Robb]] intervenes, kills Wallen and disables Osha. Stiv is killed by [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Wallen is a member of a band of wildlings and deserters who manage to evade the Watch to seek succor in the lands to the south. He is an associate of Osha and Stiv.
