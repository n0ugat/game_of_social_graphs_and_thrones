The '''winter town'''{{Ref|GOT704}} is a settlement in the [[North]], located just outside of [[Winterfell]] itself.

During the years-long winters which hit the region, the [[Smallfolk|smallfolk]] of the North came to huddle in settlements outside the walls of Winterfell for protection. Over time they built these up into permanent structures and over the centuries it grew into a more established town, though its population still swells during winter and declines during spring and summer.<ref>"[[Winterfell (Histories & Lore)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the winter town is formed by rows of small and neat houses built of log and undressed stone. Located at Winterfell's main gatehouse, the market square has wooden stalls for produce and goods and a well at its center. The local alehouse is the Smoking Log. The [[Kingsroad]] lies past the sprawl of castle and town, while the [[Wolfswood]] is two miles away. Hunting parties from Winterfell can avoid the winter town by taking the Hunter's Gate instead of the main gate.

Its streets are muddy during summer, when four fifths of the homes are left empty. During wintertime, however, the winter town becomes filled with [[northmen]] from throughout the region, such as clansmen from the northern mountains. Some townsfolk claim that [[Winterfell]] is warmed by a dragon which sleeps below the castle - really the castle was built over a series of natural hot springs.

''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' specifies that - other than [[White Harbor]], the only city in the North and a small one at that - the winter town is one of only two settlements in all of the North which are big enough to be called actual "market-towns". The other town is [[Barrowton]] to the southwest.

In the novels, the winter town is burned by the men of [[House Bolton]] when they betray the Northmen led by Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] during the attempt to liberate Winterfell from the [[House Greyjoy]] occupation led by [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], as part of the [[Sack of Winterfell]]. Despite the approach of winter, the Boltons have made no attempt to rebuild it for other refugees, and the ruins of the winter town become buried under heavy snows.
