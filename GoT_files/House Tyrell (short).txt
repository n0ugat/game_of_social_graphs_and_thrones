==Narration==
'''Margaery Tyrell''': ''[[House Tyrell]] trace our descent to [[Garth the Gardener|Garth Greenhand]], the legendary first [[King of the Reach]], who made the land bloom. But so too does every noble house around us.''

''It seems dear ancestor Garth ''planted'' as many flowers as he plucked. A king should have more consideration for his line, don't you think?''

''For over a thousand years, the Greenhand's sons and grandsons ruled the [[Reach]] as [[House Gardener]]. The offshoots of his daughters grew into vast and powerful houses in their own right. Except for House Tyrell.''

''We chose instead to serve our Gardener cousins faithfully as [[Steward|stewards]]. To manage their stronghold of [[Highgarden]] and the daily affairs of the [[Reach]].''

''Our words are "Growing Strong." And under our stewardship, the Reach did just that. As did we.''

''Until a blundering king almost cost us everything. [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] had landed in [[Westeros]]. King [[Mern IX Gardener|Mern allied]] us with the [[Westerlands|Rock]] to repel the upstart's army. One can only marvel that King Mern did not reconsider when he saw the living [[dragon]]s against him.''

''Perhaps he should have sought counsel from his trusted stewards before he set out. Then again, perhaps he did.''

''At the [[Field of Fire]], Aegon, and let us not forget [[Visenya Targaryen|his]] [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|sisters]], burned the combined armies of the Reach and Rock. King Mern paid for his misjudgment with his life and that of his ancient family. In a day, the Reach had lost its king, its ruling house, and most of its army.''

''Thankfully for everyone, my ancestor, [[Harlen Tyrell]], had better sense. Until the [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] sorted out the entail among Mern's cousins, Harlen, the steward was acting lord of Highgarden.''

''To ensure peace and life in the Reach, he would yield the castle of Aegon. The other castles and families would then follow, as they had since the [[Dawn Age]].''

''Aegon had a continent to [[Aegon's Conquest|conquer]], and the fertile Reach was too valuable to raze. He accepted Harlen's proposal and welcomed our lands into his kingdom.''

''To show his gratitude, Aegon entitled Harlen to Highgarden, the castle his family had served for a thousand years, and made House Tyrell his [[Warden of the South|Wardens of the South]], choosing us over older, greater families in the Reach.''

''Our House thus owed everything to the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]. So is it any wonder we stayed true to King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]], even during his madness, and even after [[Robert Baratheon]] [[Robert's Rebellion|rebelled]].''

''Some may question [[Mace Tyrell|my father for]] laying siege to the [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]]'s [[Storm's End|home]] instead of marching to aid Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] before [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] could [[Battle of the Trident|kill him and scatter the royal army]].''

''But let us not forget we had already dealt Robert his only [[Battle of Ashford|defeat]] of the war at [[Ashford]]. If Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] had not "[[Sack of King's Landing|vanquished]]" the Mad King so suddenly, our siege would've destroyed Robert's home and [[Stannis Baratheon|his]] [[Renly Baratheon|brothers]] and won the war for Aerys.''

''But when the Targaryens fell, House Tyrell again chose peace and prosperity over war and devastation, and bent the knee to King Robert Baratheon, First of His Name.''

''We returned to Highgarden to manage the affairs of the Reach, as we had for thousands of years and will for a thousand more.''

''Other Great Houses take [[House Lannister|lions]] and [[House Stark|wolves]] for their sigils and draw their power from the gold in their mountains or the cold of their winters. But mountains run dry, winter yields to spring, and the rose blooms once more.''
