*[[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] {[[Eddison Tollett]]}, known as "Dolorous Edd", a former [[Steward (Night's Watch)|steward]] of the [[Night's Watch]] and acting [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] after [[Jon Snow]] abdicated the position.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tollett is a House sworn to [[House Royce]] of [[Runestone]]. Their seat is the Grey Glen, their [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a pily grey and black, and their [[House words|words]] are "When All is Darkest". The current Lord of the Grey Glen is Uthor Tollett.

Dolorous Edd is apparently a member of a lesser branch of House Tollett, as he frequently makes comments indicating that he grew up in poverty, and his family were essentially living on the same level as peasants.

===Known members===
*Lord Uthor Tollett, Lord of the Grey Glen.
*Ser Andrew Tollett, a young knight of the Grey Glen.

With unspecified familiar relationship to the main branch:
*Eddison Tollett, a steward of the Night's Watch, known as "Dolorous Edd".
