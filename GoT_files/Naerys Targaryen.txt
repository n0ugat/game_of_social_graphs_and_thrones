{{Quote|The only woman in whom he took no pleasure was his sister and wife Naerys, even after she gave him a son and heir, Daeron.|[[Varys]]|The Blackfyres}}
Queen '''Naerys Targaryen''' was the sister-wife of [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], the eleventh [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty to sit on the [[Iron Throne]]. She was an ancestor of [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]].

==Biography==

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Naerys was the sister of Aegon IV, who was also her husband, and the legendary Prince Aemon, called the Dragonknight. Naerys had the classic Targaryen looks, a very fine and delicate beauty. She was very slender and small, with big purple eyes and fine, pale, porcelain skin, near translucent.

According to semi-canon sources, she almost died in the cradle and was sickly for most of her life. She was a devout follower of the [[Faith of the Seven]], and once Daeron was born she asked Aegon to release her from her vows so she could join the Faith but he refused her. She was unhappy in her marriage and it was said only her son Daeron or her brother Aemon could make her smile. Her brother, Prince Aemon championed her against the slanders of Ser Morgil and was rumored to, not only have loved her, but also to be the true father of Daeron II. Much later in her life she gave birth to a daughter, Daenerys.
