{{Quote|When one is never invited to speak, one learns instead to... observe.|Larys Strong to Alicent Hightower|We Light the Way}}
Lord '''Larys Strong''', called the '''Clubfoot''' due to his pronounced birth defect, is the [[Lord of Harrenhal]] and head of [[House Strong]]. He is the second son of Lord [[Lyonel Strong]], and the younger brother of Ser [[Harwin Strong]].{{Guideref|Larys Strong}} Late in the reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]], he rose to the position of [[Lord Confessor]]. He remains a prominent figure at court when King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] ascends to the throne, and is later appointed to the King's [[Small Council]] as [[Master of Whisperers]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Larys was born with a severe {{WPS|clubfoot}}, a birth defect that causes his right foot to be severely curved inward and downward. When his father saw him after his birth he believed that someone had cursed his son, and accused a member of his household of casting spells.{{Ref|HOTD206}} Due to his malformation, Larys walks with a cane inset with a golden firefly.{{Guideref|Larys Strong}}
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===

Larys, along with his father and brother, joins [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys]]'s hunting party on Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s second [[nameday]]. Being unable to participate in the hunt due to his foot, he sits with [[Alicent Hightower|Queen Alicent]] and the other noble ladies in the royal tent, quietly listening in on their conversation.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

In the [[godswood]] of the [[Red Keep]], Larys informs Alicent of [[Grand Maester]] [[Mellos]]'s delivery of [[moon tea]] to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], and offers to be her ally at court. This leads to Alicent and Rhaenyra's relationship to further estrangement.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Ten years later, Alicent and Larys have become full confidants in one another. Alicent informs Larys of his father's attempted resignation as [[Hand of the King]], and expresses her regret over her own father's dismissal. Larys subsequently gathers prisoners from the [[Black Cells]] has their tongues cut out, using them to set a fire at Harrenhal in which both his father and brother are killed. He later informs Alicent of this, clearing a path for [[Otto Hightower]] to return as Hand, though Alicent is disturbed by Larys's actions.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Larys attends the funeral of [[Laena Velaryon]] at [[High Tide]], where [[Criston Cole]] mentions to Alicent that Larys has been staring at her unabashedly. Alicent replies that it is only a look of pride as Larys is the new Lord of [[Harrenhal]]. After the incident between [[Lucerys Velaryon|Prince Lucerys]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|Prince Aemond]] which saw the latter lose an eye, Larys approaches her on their ship back to [[King's Landing]], offering to take Lucerys's eye to balance the scales. Alicent refuses his offer, but says that his devotion has not gone unnoticed and that the day will come when she will require such a friend.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Six years later, Larys is the [[Lord Confessor]] in the [[Red Keep]]. During the [[coup in King's Landing]], the Clubfoot observes the prisoners escorted to the dungeons for their knowledge of the king's death and an audience in the [[throne room]] in which Otto had the lords of the realm bend the knee and swear fealty to Aegon II. Larys then tips the guards to arrest Lord [[Allun Caswell]], who had been trying to escape the Red Keep to inform Rhaenyra of the coup. After Caswell has his execution ordered by Otto Hightower, Otto congratulates Larys and mentions that Larys had been spending many hours with the queen lately. Larys replies that there is no reason those hours could not in the end benefit Otto.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

At night, Alicent exits her meeting with Otto and shows discomfort to find Larys waiting for her in her chambers. Larys offers her information on [[Mysaria]]'s network of spies in the Red Keep—which includes Alicent's lady-in-waiting [[Talya]]—and its usage by Otto Hightower, offering to kill Mysaria to destroy his advantage. In exchange, Larys quietly demands sexual favors through Alicent showing Larys her feet, to which he pleasures himself as Alicent looks away. Later, one of Larys's convicts sets fire to Mysaria's safehouse.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Larys intercepts Dowager Queen Alicent following a meeting of the [[Green Council]], informing her that he has completed his interrogation of the Red Keep's servants and infers that any spying for persons other than himself have been executed. He also informs Alicent that he has personally selected her new ladies in waiting, much to Alicent's disquiet. Larys is later present in the throne room while King Aegon hold court for the smallfolk, noting the tension arising between Aegon and Otto. After the session of court concludes, Larys catches Aegon on the way back to his chambers, obsequiously flattering the king by comparing him to his [[Viserys I Targaryen|father]] and [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|great-grandfather]], while suggesting Aegon may want a more forceful [[Hand of the King|Hand]] than Otto, lest the perception of Otto manipulating him like his pliable father becomes the common view.{{Ref|HOTD201}}
[[File:2x1 Aegon and Larys Still.jpg|thumb|Larys influencing Aegon. ]]
Following the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murder]] of Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]], Larys interrupts a hasty meeting of the [[Green Council|Small Council]] to inform them [[Blood|one of the Prince's murderers]] has been apprehended at the [[Gate of the Gods]] with Jaehaerys's head in a sack. Otto overrules King Aegon's wish to execute the man, instructing Larys to interrogate him for further information. Larys has Blood imprisoned in a cell, but the moment he unveils his instruments of torture, Blood hastily confesses that he and [[Cheese|one of the Red Keep's rat catchers]] were hired by Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] to kill Jaehaerys. Once the interrogation is complete, Larys watches as King Aegon comes to the cell and bludgeons Blood to death with a mace.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

After King Aegon declares his intention to march to war alongside Ser Criston Cole, Larys comes to the King's chambers and informs Aegon that there are rumors flying about King's Landing that his [[Alicent Hightower|mother]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|brother]] have goaded him into marching out so they can rule in his absence. Aegon names Larys as his [[Master of Whisperers]], acknowledging he feels a need for one more than his late father did.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

In his absence, Larys's seat at Harrenhal is captured by Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Caraxes]]; Larys's great-uncle and castellan, Ser [[Simon Strong]] hastily declares his allegiance to Rhaenyra. When Daemon questions his alacrity, Simon makes it clear he despises Larys, considering him a [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]] guilty of his father and brother's deaths.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

At the first meeting of the Small Council following Larys's appointment as Master of Whisperers, a furious King Aegon berates him for failing to either warn them or do more to prevent Daemon from [[Taking of Harrenhal|seizing Harrenhal]]; an unconcerned Larys responds to the King's complaints that Harrenhal is a penniless ruin (as he controls all its gold) that is beyond Daemon's ability to restore sufficiently to make effective use of it, so allowing him to take the castle will keep him bogged down in the Riverlands while Ser Criston suppresses Rhaenyra's allies in the Crownlands. After the meeting, Larys pays a visit to Alicent, who absented herself from the meeting, ostensibly to check in on her. He makes a wry smile when Alicent claims she overindulged in lamprey pie while observing a bottle that contained [[moon tea]] brought to her by [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]]. The pair discuss Prince Daemon's capture of Harrenhal, Larys reiterating to Alicent he sees the castle's loss as a necessary sacrifice to keep the Blacks occupied, and Criston Cole's military successes in the Crownlands, before Larys observes several of Viserys's old history books on the table between them, remarking his surprise Alicent shared her husband's love of history. Alicent replies that she has an interest in the subject, noting Viserys looked to history to guide him. Larys asks if Alicent believes Viserys looked to history when he chose to name Aegon his heir, noting that no matter how well suited he thought his eldest daughter for the crown, history would have told him how Westeros would react to Rhaenyra's succession. Alicent bluntly replies the significance of Viserys's intentions, which are impossible to know now, died with him; war is inevitable now, and Rhaenyra and Aegon's supporters will believe what they will to justify their actions in the coming conflict, to which Larys agrees.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Following King Aegon's severe wounding at the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]], Larys attends a Small Council meeting where Grand Maester Orwyle reports the state of the King's injuries and his uncertainty that Aegon will survive. Larys agrees with Alicent's proposal a regent should be named to rule in Aegon's stead, to assure the smallfolk of the Crown's stability; in the following debate over candidates, Larys supports Prince Aemond, explaining to a displeased Alicent that it would be taken ill if, having started a war in opposition to Rhaenyra's succession to the Iron Throne, the Green Council named a woman to lead them. Following Aemond being appointed Regent, the discussion moves onto the Greens' strength in the Riverlands; when Tyland Lannister mentions House Tully's bannermen are in disarray, impeding Daemon's efforts to raise an army, Larys suggests sending a raven to Ser [[Oscar Tully]], who will likely soon inherit lordship of Riverrun from his elderly [[Grover Tully|grandsire]], and affirm his allegiance, only for Aemond to scoff that he should heed the advice of a man who let their enemies seize the greatest castle in the Riverlands.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

At a meeting of the [[Green Council|Small Council]], Aemond, having received Lord Jason's summons, furiously erupts at Tyland Lannister over his twin brother's arrogant audacity to summon him like a servant. Tyland attempts to defend his brother's decision by reminding Aemond of [[Caraxes]]'s presence at Harrenhal (against whom the Lannister host would be defenseless should [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] fly out to intercept them), but Aemond angrily orders Tyland to write back commanding Jason to march into the Riverlands, threatening Caraxes will become the least of Jason's problems if he disobeys.<ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 6: "[[Smallfolk (episode)|Smallfolk]]" (2024).</ref>

At another session of the Small Council, Aemond complains to Jasper Wylde and [[Larys Strong]] (the only other attendees) as to why the smallfolk are blaming him for food shortages when Rhaenyra ordered the blockade. Larys points out the smallfolk expect him to ensure their safety and suggests that Aemond name a new [[Hand of the King]], in place of Criston, to aid him. Aemond scornfully mocks Larys for thinking he would ever name Larys to the position, ordering him to summon Ser [[Otto Hightower]] back to the capital to resume his old office. The meeting is interrupted by Orwyle, who informs them that Aegon has regained conciousness. Aemond adjourns the meeting and goes to Aegon's chambers.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:2x8 Aegon and Larys Still.jpg|thumb|Larys helps Aegon recover.]]

When Aegon is offered [[milk of the poppy]] by a maidservant, Larys objects, ordering her to give the king his draught in an hour. He says to Aegon that while the milk takes his pain away, it also dulls his mind. He assures Aegon that he has been written into legend because he survived dragonfire, but he also relents that Aegon will never again be whole despite Orwyle's abilities, much to the king's grief. He insists that Aegon's mind is all that will remain to him. Larys recounts to Aegon the circumstances of his birth defect, and tearfully tells Aegon that people will pity him and stare at him behind his back, or turn away in disgust altogether. However, Larys also advises that people will underestimate Aegon, and that this could become his advantage. As he prepares to leave, Aegon pleads to him. Larys tells the king that his life is in danger since Aemond now rules in his place. Aegon asks Larys to help him.<ref name=":0" />[[File:2x7 Jasper and Larys Still.jpg|thumb|[[Jasper Wylde|Jasper]] and Larys discuss a new [[Addam of Hull|dragonrider]].]]
In the courtyard, Larys observes as [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] sentences [[Martyn Reyne|two]] [[Eddard Waters|Kingsguards]] to lifetime servitude at the [[Wall]], ostensibly for fomenting the riots. Lord [[Jasper Wylde]] approaches Larys and says that Seasmoke has a new, unknown rider. Considering it an unverified rumor, Larys suggests they withhold telling Aemond. Against Orwyle's advice, Larys pushes him to accelerate [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s recovery, despite the physical exertion causing Aegon extreme pain.<ref name=":1">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 7: "[[The Red Sowing]]" (2024).</ref>

During a meeting of the Green Council, presided over by Aemond, Lord Jasper Wylde warns that [[Ormund Hightower|Lord Ormund Hightower]] is making slow progress and there is fear that his armies are caught between two forces of [[House Beesbury]], those present hear a buzz coming from outside the castle, but at first they give it little weight, Lord Jasper continues giving good news, [[Tessarion]], [[Daeron Targaryen|Prince Daeron]]'s dragon, has taken flight and will soon be ready to fight for the greens, and with him the Hightower army will be unstoppable, the members of the council hear the guards shout "dragon", and at that point Aemond, suspicious, opens the doors to the balcony and sees a dragon, Silverwing, flying in the sky, and moves to attack it. <ref name=":1" />
[[File:Larys and Aegon flee.40.png|thumb|Larys and Aegon flee the city.]]
Larys tells [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] about Rhaenyra's new dragonriders and Aemond's decimating Sharp Point. He also warns that Aemond's rage is an even greater threat to Aegon's life. Aegon wants Aemond imprisoned, but Larys argues Aemond and Vhagar are essential assets to fighting the [[Dance of the Dragons|war]]. Having moved the bulk of Harrenhal's gold to the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]], Larys proposes that he and Aegon hide in [[Essos]] and return and reclaim the [[Iron Throne|throne]] after Aemond and Rhaenyra have destroyed each other.<ref name=":2">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 8: "[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]" (2024).</ref>

Later, Aegon and Larys secretly depart the city in a covered chicken coup carrier wagon on route to Essos.<ref name=":2" />

==Personality==
Larys is cunning and remorseless,{{Guideref|Larys Strong}} having no qualms about committing murders, even [[kinslaying]].{{Ref|HOTD106}} He may pretend to be friendly and helpful, thus earning people's trust (like Alicent{{Ref|HOTD105}}, Otto{{Ref|HOTD109}}) and Aegon{{Ref|HOTD208}}), but actually seeks to cause mistrust and division, using them for his own interests. He seeks to gain influence by ingratiating himself with those who wield power.{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

Despite his manipulative nature, Larys shows a rare glimpse of empathy and vulnerability when speaking to Aegon. Though an undertone of manipulation lingers, his words about how others will judge Aegon’s appearance reflect his own experiences with pain and isolation—scars from his deformity that forged his ambitions.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

{{Quote|What are children, but a weakness? A folly? A futility? Through them, you imagine you cheat the great darkness of its victory. You will persist forever, in some form or another.

[[File:Larys Cane.png|thumb|Lord Larys cane with personal sigil of a firefly.]]
On September 24, 2021, [[HBO]] announced that [[Matthew Needham]] had been cast in the role of Larys Strong for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. His character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] reads as follows:
:''"Younger son of Master of Laws Lyonel Strong, brought to court by his father."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

His character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"Younger son of late master of laws Lyonel Strong, named Lord of Harrenhal following the sudden and suspicious deaths of his father and brother, Larys seeks to gain influence by ingratiating himself with those who wield power."''{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Larys Strong was known as Larys the Clubfoot, and rarely spoke, preferring instead to listen. On the occasion that he did speak, it was either to be glib or share very important information.

Larys was the son of Lord Lyonel Strong, who served on the small council of Viserys I Targaryen and brought Larys and his brother Harwin to court. While Harwin is made Commander of the City Watch, Larys is made one of the king's confessors.

The fact that Larys orchestrated the fire at Harrenhal is never revealed in the books. Instead, he is merely one of several suspects, a list that also includes Prince Daemon, Corlys Velaryon, and King Viserys himself.
