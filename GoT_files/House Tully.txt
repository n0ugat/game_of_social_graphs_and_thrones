'''House Tully'''{{Ref|GOT106}} of [[Riverrun]] is a [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]]. Its most senior member carried the title of [[Lord of Riverrun]] and [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]], until the [[Red Wedding]]. The current head is Lord [[Edmure Tully]], son of the late [[Hoster Tully]]. The Tully sigil is a silver trout on a red and blue background. Their [[house words]] are "Family, Duty, Honor."<ref name="House Tully histories & lore" /><ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref>

At the onset of the [[War of the Five Kings]], House Tully came under attack by [[House Lannister]] and lent its support for [[House Stark]] when they came to their aid in the liberation of the Riverlands. House Tully has since been [[Attainder|formally stripped]] of lands and titles for rebellion against the [[Iron Throne]], with Lord Edmure a [[hostage|captive]] of [[House Frey]] following the [[Red Wedding]]. 

Later, [[Brynden Tully]] gathered the remaining Tully forces and [[Taking of Riverrun|reclaimed]] Riverrun from the Freys, reopening conflict between the Tullys and the [[Iron Throne]]. The Freys [[Second siege of Riverrun|lay siege]] to Riverrun, and were later assisted by the Lannisters on the orders of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen I]]. [[Jaime Lannister]] managed to end the siege by convincing Edmure Tully to command the garrison to lay down their weapons in return for clemency and protection. Brynden was killed during a final stand with Lannister and Frey forces while Edmure was returned to the Freys as a prisoner. Following the deaths of most of House Frey and the [[Battle of King's Landing|defeat]] of [[Cersei Lannister]] at [[King's Landing]], Edmure is freed and restored to his titles and lands.

== History==
===Background ===
House Tully is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. Their lands are the central part of the continent. Their seat is [[Riverrun]], a castle at the confluence of the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]] with the [[Tumblestone]]. They rule over the [[Riverlands]] from the castle and the head of the house is the [[Lord of Riverrun]].

House Tully rose to prominence during [[Aegon's Conquest]]. Lord [[Edmyn Tully]] rebelled against the [[King of the Iron Islands]], [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]], to support the invading [[House Targaryen]]. Edmyn's fellow Riverlords followed his lead. When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] established his rule from the [[Iron Throne]] he rewarded Edmyn, elevating the Tullys to [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|Lords Paramount of the Trident]].<ref name="House Tully viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/tully/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Tully entry]</ref>

House Tully fought on the side of the [[Iron Throne]] during the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. [[Hoster Tully]] and [[Brynden Tully]] fought during the conflict. The two brothers later parted on acrimonious terms after Brynden rejected his older brother's command that he marry [[Bethany Redwyne]] in order to seal a marriage pact with [[House Redwyne]]. Brynden broke ties with Hoster, earning the name "Blackfish", which also became his personal sigil.<ref name="House Tully histories & lore">"[[House Tully (short)|House Tully]]"</ref> Hoster later married Lady [[Minisa Tully|Minisa]] of [[House Whent]]<ref name="House Tully viewers guide" /> and they produced three children: two daughters [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]], and a son named [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]].<ref name="House Tully histories & lore" />

Its current head is Lord Edmure Tully.<ref name="Hoster Tully viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/tully/hoster-tully/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Tully - Hoster Tully entry]</ref> His sisters, Catelyn and Lysa, married Lords [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Jon Arryn]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]], forming a powerful alliance of major houses.<ref name="Lysa Arryn viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/arryn/lysa-arryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Arryn - Lysa Arryn entry]</ref> Together, the Tully-Stark-Arryn alliance defeated the "Mad King" [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]] and ended Targaryen rule over the [[Seven Kingdoms]].<ref name="House Tully histories & lore" />

==Military strength==
During Robert's Rebellion and the War of the Five Kings, House Tully has proven itself capable in times of conflict, fighting and prevailing with several engagements within each conflict, such as the [[Battle of the Trident]] and the [[Battle of the Fords]]. However, the Red Wedding greatly weakened the once formidable great house, leading to the destruction of the Tully army and stripping them of lands and titles. Despite this enormous setback, House Tully managed to [[Taking of Riverrun|reclaim]] Riverrun; however, it was eventually lost due to [[Second siege of Riverrun|capitulation]] of the Tully garrison, leading to the death of [[Brynden Tully]], leaving House Tully in a precarious position.

The Tully soldiers are outfitted with black scale leather armor, possibly being inspired by the Tully sigil, with chainmail beneath, adding further protection to the wearer. This design, is not aesthetically practical but more symbolic, since the Tully men live in a region that consists mostly of rivers. The design also provides a degree of low visibility during nighttime, allowing them to raid enemy camps with little detection. This makes them nimble compared to soldiers who might be wearing heavy plates of armor, while retaining a degree of protection.

==Family tree==
{{Tully tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tully is an old house which has held the castle at [[Riverrun]] for some centuries, but did not rise to greatness until King Aegon I's invasion. Aegon drove the ironborn out of the Riverlands and appointed Lord Edmyn Tully as the overlord of the area in thanks for his support during the Conquest. The Tullys joined the [[House Stark|Starks]], [[House Baratheon|Baratheons]] and [[House Arryn|Arryns]] in rising against the Mad King, providing numerous troops for [[Robert Baratheon]]'s armies.

The Tully banner is different in the books than in the series. In the TV series, it is striped horizontally, with one large red section and one large blue section, separated by white stripes. In the novels it has five ''vertical'' stripes of equal width; two muddy-red stripes separate three blue stripes (and there are no white stripes).

In a somewhat unusual in-joke, ''The World of Ice & Fire'' reveals that Tullys active during the [[Dance of the Dragons]] are named after Muppets of ''Sesame Street'': Lord [[w:c:muppet:Grover|Grover]] Tully, his grandson Ser [[w:c:muppet:Elmo|Elmo]] Tully, and his great-grandsons Lord [[w:c:muppet:Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] Tully and Ser [[w:c:muppet:Oscar the Grouch|Oscar]] Tully.

The following sworn houses did not appear in the series:
* House Piper of [[Pinkmaiden]]
*House Ryger of Willow Wood
*House Vance of Wayfarer's Rest
*House Vance of Atranta
* House Paege
