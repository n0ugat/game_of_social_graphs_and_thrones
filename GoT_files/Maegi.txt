*{[[Maggy]]}, also known as Maggy the Frog, a maegi who at some point moved to [[Westeros]], and used to live in the woods near [[Casterly Rock]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, ''Maegi'' are distrusted and hated by the Dothraki, who claim they lay with demons. Some of them have the capability of foretelling a person's future by tasting a drop of their blood.

According to Mirri Maz Duur, the word "''Maegi''" means "wise".

"Maggy", who in the books is stated to be Essosi, probably gets her name from a [[Common Tongue]] attempt at pronouncing "maegi".
