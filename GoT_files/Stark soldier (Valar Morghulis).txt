A '''Stark soldier''' is a soldier sworn to [[House Stark]].

==Biography==
===Background===
He is fighting for [[House Stark]] in the [[Riverlands]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]].{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] is escorting [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] from [[Riverrun]] to [[King's Landing]] to exchange him for the daughters of [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]. She stops when she sees the bodies of three women hanging in a tree. One of them has a sign around her neck saying they lay with lions. Jaime mentions that they were probably tavern girls who had relations with [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers. Jaime confronts Brienne with the charge that this atrocity was committed by her side. She reminds him that she doesn't fight for the Starks, she has given fealty to Lady Catelyn.{{Ref|GOT210}}

When they hear the three Northern soldiers coming, Jaime says to free his hands, but Brienne ignores him. The Stark soldier is accompanying [[Tom]] and another man. Brienne tells the men that she is transporting a criminal to Riverrun for justice. Jaime adopts a lower class accent and says he stole a pig. When the three realize that Brienne is a woman, they laugh hysterically at her. Brienne asked if the dead women were given quick deaths. The leader of the three bluntly says that two of them were.{{Ref|GOT210}}

At this point, the Stark soldier recognizes Jaime, having seen him at the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]], and the leader challenges Brienne and Jaime to simultaneously say what Jaime's name is. She kills him and his companions, giving two of them quick deaths. She then cuts down and buries the hanging women.{{Ref|GOT210}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Brienne, Jaime and [[Alton Lannister#In the books|Cleos Frey]] do not run into any Stark soldiers after they escape from Riverrun. They do see the women hanging in the tree with the same sign, near smouldering remains of a large building, at the lands of [[House Bracken]]. Cleos recalls spending a night at that inn with his escorts on the way back to Riverrun. They presume the women were killed by Northmen, as the sign reveals, though it is uncertain by whose order; Jaime and Cleos guess it could have been [[Jonos Bracken]], Marq Piper, [[Beric Dondarrion]] or [[Roose Bolton]].

Brienne pulls the boat over, climbs the tree, and begins to cut the bodies down. However, when she gets high enough, she sees the mast of the boat from Riverrun that is pursuing them, so she leaves the women unburied and they flee.
