'''Sea Dragon Point'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a large peninsula in the [[North]]. It extends northwards, separating the [[Bay of Ice]] to the east from the [[Sunset Sea]] in the west. It is located west of the [[Wolfswood]]. The nearest major castle is [[Deepwood Motte]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Sea Dragon Point is in the same location.

According to Tristifer Botley, Sea Dragon Point is totally worthless: there are no mines, and the land is too wet for agriculture.
