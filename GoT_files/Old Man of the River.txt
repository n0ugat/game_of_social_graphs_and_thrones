The '''Old Man of the River'''<ref>https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/movie-tv-memorabilia/props/gilly-hannah-murray-leather-bound-history-book-from-game-of-thrones-hbo-r-original-2011-20/a/7366-89595.s</ref> is a lesser god of the [[Rhoynar]]. During the [[Long Night]], a hero (the Rhoynish version of [[Azor Ahai]]) is said to have convinced the Old Man of the River and the [[Crab King]] to put aside their petty fighting and sing a secret song to bring back the day.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Old Man of the River's story is the same. A species of giant turtle is named after him.

The crew of the ''Shy Maid'' see a huge horned turtle at [[Ny Sar]]. The captain, Yandry, proclaims that it is the Old Man of the River himself.
