''[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' is the upcoming third live-action television series of the ''World of Westeros''. It will be the third installment of the franchise overall. It was greenlit by HBO in April 2023 and began filming in June 2024 for a late 2025 release. The series was later delayed, scheduled for an early 2026 release.

==Successor shows==
[[File:GRRM with White Walker ice-blade.png|thumb|left|300px|George R.R. Martin is in discussions with HBO to develop multiple successor shows for ''Game of Thrones''.]]
Following the conclusion of ''Game of Thrones'' in 2018, HBO began developing multiple successor shows to follow the main TV series.

The first wave of successor shows were initially pitched in 2016, and publicly announced as potential projects in May 2017. A second wave of pitches for successor shows was announced in early 2021. [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] were confirmed to not be returning to write for subsequent projects. [[George R.R. Martin]] is returning as a consultant with HBO on these future projects.

Martin has insisted that these upcoming projects be called "successor shows" but not "spinoffs", explaining:

:''"For what it's worth, I don't especially like the term 'spinoff,' and I don't think it really applies to these new projects. What we're talking about are new stories set in the 'secondary universe' (to borrow Tolkien's term) of Westeros and the world beyond, the world I created for A Song of Ice and Fire. It is a world, and a pretty big one, and if there were eight million stories in the naked city back in the 50s, just think how many more there are in an entire world, and one with thousands of years of recorded history...Rather than 'spinoff' or 'prequel,' however, I prefer the term 'successor show.' That's what I've been calling them."''<ref>[https://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html  About Those Spinoffs]</ref>

On October 29, 2019, HBO officially ordered ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', a prequel set 200 years before the events of the main show. 

===Active pitches===
====Live-action pitches====
In addition to the produced ''House of the Dragon'', HBO is currently considering a number of potential live-action successor shows (prequels and a sequel), all of which have advanced from the pitch phase to the pilot script phase as of March 2022. There is no guarantee that any of them will be greenlit to film a pilot or to full series, though George R.R. Martin has said that progress is going well on all projects:<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/09/random-updates-and-bits-o-news/ Random Updates and Bits o’ News,] GRRM, Not A Blog, March 9, 2022</ref>
*'''''[[Ten Thousand Ships]]''''': Set 1,000 years before ''Game of Thrones'', showing the massive war between Valyria and the [[Rhoynar]], ancestors of the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]]. After their defeat by the dragon-lords, Princess [[Nymeria]] rallies the surviving Rhoynar to flee across the sea in a large refugee fleet of "ten thousand ships", in a journey that takes them around the exotic lands of the [[Summer Sea]] before finally settling in [[Dorne]]. A pilot script has been ordered from screenwriter [[Amanda Segel]]. <ref>[https://deadline.com/2021/05/game-of-thrones-amanda-segel-write-10000-ships-spinoff-1234763526/ ‘Game Of Thrones’: Amanda Segel To Write ‘10,000 Ships’ Spinoff]</ref>

====Animated pitches====
As of 2024, HBO is also considering three separate pitches for animated successor shows:
*'''''[[Nine Voyages]]''''': About the famous nine voyages of exploration by young [[Corlys Velaryon]]. It is much more of a direct tie-in to ''House of the Dragon'', as the older Corlys appears as a starring character in the other series. Veteran HBO writer [[Bruno Heller]] is attached, and a pilot script has been ordered.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2021/03/game-of-thrones-prequels-sea-snake-9-voyages-flea-bottom-10000-ships-bruno-heller-1234717042/ ‘Game Of Thrones’: Sea Snake’s 9 Voyages Among Three More Spinoffs In Consideration At HBO]</ref> Conceived as a live-action project, George R.R. Martin confirmed on December 31, 2023 that the prequel was now in development as an animated series.{{Webref|name=Animation |author=George R.R.

*'''''[[The Golden Empire]]''''': About the Golden Empire of [[Yi Ti]], located east of [[Qarth]] in the [[Jade Sea]], Yi Ti is essentially the ''Game of Thrones'' equivalent of Imperial China. It doesn't appear in the main novels but has a chapter devoted to it in ''The World of Ice & Fire''. In March 2022, George R.R. Martin said that a writer is attached and he is reviewing concept art with them, though the project hasn't been officially greenlit yet.<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/09/random-updates-and-bits-o-news/ Random Updates and Bits o’ News,] GRRM, Not A Blog, March 9, 2022</ref>
*Another pitch for an animated successor show.<ref name="Animation" />
**In March 2021, it was reported that [[Vince Gerardis]] was developing a project with the working title ''A Song of Ice and Fire''. If it is one of the pitches for a successor show, it is most likely an animated series as all four live-action projects have already been revealed. Winter Is Coming speculated that this project may be an animated adaptation of the books.<ref>https://winteriscoming.net/2021/03/11/game-of-thrones-producer-developing-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-new-show/</ref> It may also simply be a working title for the Broadway play about the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]], of which Gerardis is an executive producer, the "Ice and Fire" referring to [[Lyanna Stark]] and [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] ([[#Other projects|see below]]).

===Rejected pitches and concepts===
*A prequel on '''[[Aegon's Conquest (Rand Ravich/Far Shariat)|Aegon's Conquest]]''' developed by [[Rand Ravich]] and [[Far Shariat]] before it was ultimately rejected. The pilot script portrayed Aegon as a drunken lout.<ref name="THR" />
*'''''[[Bloodmoon]]''''': A prequel about the [[Long Night]], set in the distant past almost 5,000 years ago. This was the first prequel pitch that HBO ordered, ahead of several other pitches. Martin has stated he never wanted to actually set a prequel narrative during this era, so it was not based on any prior prequel novellas, and had barely a few sentences of source material to draw on. HBO rejected the project soon after seeing the first rough cut of the [[Pilot (Bloodmoon)|pilot]] in October 2019, when it was vaguely admitted that the project had a troubled development which was marred by "creative differences" since its beginning.
*A prequel on the '''[[Doom of Valyria (pitch)|Doom of Valyria]]''': In July 2018, an unverified extensive report leaked to the Wiki of Westeros itself that [[Max Borenstein]]'s prequel pitch covered the [[Doom of Valyria]]. Supposedly titled ''Empire of Ash'', it would chronicle the decline and fall of the [[Valyrian Freehold]], ending with its volcanic destruction and the escape of the Targaryens to Westeros with the last dragons. After ''Bloodmoon'' was rejected, in November 2019 linguist David J. Peterson admitted that the three prequel pitches which advanced far enough to have their own writing staffs and series bibles were ''Bloodmoon'', ''House of the Dragon'', and a show about "Old Valyria". Screenwriter [[Max Borenstein]] later admitted in 2021 that his prequel pitch was very developed and had a series bible, indirectly admitting that his project was in fact the Valyria prequel. While HBO ultimately passed on Borenstein's prequel, there have been multiple changes in leadership since then, and Borenstein said that given the amount of time and effort he devoted into the project he still wants to make it, and hopes that HBO's new leadership will reconsider it at some point in the future.
*'''''[[The Dance of the Dragons]]''''': A prequel pitch on the Targaryen civil war of the same name, first helmed by [[Carly Wray]] before passing onto [[Bryan Cogman]].
*'''''[[Flea Bottom (concept)|Flea Bottom]]''''': Among the new prequel pitches revealed in spring 2021, one was described as being set in [[Flea Bottom]], the worst slum district in King's Landing. No writers were formally attached and the actual nature of the show was unknown: whether it would be set during a specific time period or an anthology. It might have been intended as a tie-in to ''House of the Dragon'', as in his youth [[Daemon Targaryen]] was commander of the City Watch and used it to take over the criminal underworld in the slum district. The project had apparently been quietly dropped by summer 2021.
*A prequel on the '''[[Seven Gods]]''': A short-lived concept for a TV series would have followed the [[Seven]] as mortals, doing deeds that would lead to them being [[Faith of the Seven|worshiped]] as gods.<ref name="THR" />
*Two animated projects were shelved by 2024.<ref name="Animation" />
*'''''[[Snow]]''''': Created by and starring [[Kit Harington]], who intended to reprise his role as [[Jon Snow]] in a sequel to his storyline in ''Game of Thrones''.<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/06/23/snow-and-other-stuff/ Not a Blog: "SNOW… and Other Stuff",] June 23, 2022</ref>

==History==
===''A Song of Ice and Fire'' {{C|1996-present}}===
{{Main|A Song of Ice and Fire}}
''A Song of Ice and Fire'' is an award-winning series of bestselling epic fantasy novels by George R.R. Martin. The ''World of Westeros'' franchise is an adaptation of Martin's novels and supplementary material.

===A decade of ''Game of Thrones'' {{C|2008-2019}}===
{{Main|Game of Thrones}}
A [[Pilot (Game of Thrones)|pilot]] for ''Game of Thrones'', an adaptation of ''A Song of Ice and Fire'', was ordered by HBO in November 2008. In March 2010, the [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|first season]] was ordered, which culminated in an eight-season run for the series and the development of the ''World of Westeros'' franchise.

===First wave of pitches {{C|2017-2018}}===
[[File:Four prequels one throne.jpg|thumb|350px|Four new producers vying to create successor shows:  Carly Wray, Brian Helgeland, Max Borenstein, and Jane Goldman.]]
On May 4, 2017, HBO announced it had ordered pitch scripts for four separate ''Game of Thrones'' successor shows (after negotiations which had privately begun in 2016). While the identity of each prequel was not revealed, the four potential showrunners were announced as: [[Jane Goldman]], [[Max Borenstein]], [[Brian Helgeland]], and [[Carly Wray]]<ref>[http://ew.com/tv/2017/05/04/game-of-thrones-prequels-spinoffs/ ''Entertainment Weekly'' - HBO developing 4 different Game of Thrones spinoffs], May 4, 2017</ref> George R.R. Martin subsequently made an extensive post on his personal blog about the announcement.<ref>[https://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html About Those Spinoffs]</ref> Martin confirmed that while at the time, HBO announced only ''four'' prequel pitches, a ''fifth'' had also just been presented, but for some reason wasn't included in HBO's announcement. It was only confirmed four months later, on September 20, that the fifth prequel pitch was being developed by [[Bryan Cogman]].<ref>[https://grrm.livejournal.com/550336.html And Then There Were Five...]</ref> 

Martin explained in his blog that he first discussed making prequel series with HBO in August 2016 (after [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]] of the main series finished airing). At the time, he pitched two prequel ideas: one of these continued as one of the announced set of five ideas (it is unclear which one), while the other sixth idea was rejected and never made it that far.<ref>[https://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html About Those Spinoffs]</ref>

Martin also gave two other brief pieces of information, confirming that ''none'' of the ideas being pitched is a sequel to the main series (considering that the main novels aren't even finished yet) but prequels, and will not include any living characters from the main series. Moreover, he officially ruled out a few prequel ideas (see below). As Martin said:

:''"Every one of the concepts under discussion is a prequel, rather than a sequel. Some may not even be set on Westeros. Rather than 'spinoff' or 'prequel,' however, I prefer the term 'successor show.' That's what I've been calling them."''<ref>[https://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html About Those Spinoffs]</ref>

Jane Goldman and Carly Wray's projects both had George R.R. Martin himself attached as a co-producer, though he also had ongoing story discussions with every showrunner:

:''"It was stated in some of the reports that I am working with two of the four writers. That's not quite right. I've actually been working with all four of the writers. Every one of the four has visited me here in Santa Fe, some of them more than once, and we've spent days together discussing their ideas, the history of Westeros and the world beyond, and sundry details found only in 'The World of Ice & Fire' and 'The Lands of Ice & Fire'...They are all amazing talents, and I am excited to be working with them. In between visits, I've been in touch with them by phone, text, and email, and I expect there will be a lot more back-and-forth as we move forward."''<ref>[https://grrm.livejournal.com/536859.html About Those Spinoffs]</ref>

===''Bloodmoon'' {{C|2018-2019}}===
{{Main|Bloodmoon}}
[[File:Jane Goldman IMDB profile pic.jpg|thumb|[[Jane Goldman]], showrunner on the ''Bloodmoon'' prequel pilot.]]
On June 8, 2018, HBO announced that it has ordered a live-action [[Pilot (Bloodmoon)|pilot]] for [[Jane Goldman]]'s prequel pitch, and revealed its identity: it was about the [[Age of Heroes]] and the [[Long Night]] that occurred during it, when the [[White Walkers]] first appeared and nearly destroyed the world. On June 11, 2018, George R.R. Martin made a post on his personal blog to congratulate Goldman, and give an update on the current status of the prequels. Martin confirmed that by this point one of the other five pitches had been officially rejected, but the remaining three were still being considered.<ref>[http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2018/06/11/hbo-greenlights-goldman-pilot/ HBO Greenlights Goldman Pilot], June 8, 2018</ref>

On October 30, HBO made its first casting announcement for the project, revealing that [[Naomi Watts]] would play the lead character.<ref>[https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/game-of-thrones-prequel-pilot-naomi-watts-hbo-1202977630/ ‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Casts Naomi Watts in Lead Role]</ref> Two large waves of casting announcements followed: one on January 8, 2019, and a second in March 2019.<ref>[https://www.thewrap.com/game-of-thrones-prequel-cast-naomi-ackie-jamie-campbell-bower-toby-regbo/ ‘Game of Thrones’ Prequel Adds 8 to Cast]</ref> Throughout these casting announcements, HBO gave no character descriptions or even the names of the characters the cast were playing - as it wasn't adapting a previous prequel novella, and Martin hadn't intended to develop prequel stories during this era in the distant past. Therefore it is unknown what the specific story of this pilot was actually going to be like.

Filming on the pilot took place during summer 2019, with principal shooting beginning around late May (just as the final season of ''Game of Thrones'' was airing) and wrapping up in August. Leaked production photos during this time revealed that the pilot was named "Bloodmoon", which was later confirmed to be the working title for the overall Long Night prequel project. A rough cut of the pilot was delivered to HBO in September - which then immediately requested that it be re-edited. Soon afterwards on October 29, 2019, HBO confirmed that the prequel was formally rejected. Given the large investment of time and money into the project, its rejection came as a shock - up until that point HBO had been treating it as the flagship title for ''Game of Thrones'' spinoffs, with the other prequel pitches on hold.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-naomi-watts-led-prequel-dead-at-hbo-1250795]</ref> The exact details concerning the reasons for rejection remain unknown. The only word about it from official news sources was a report the next day in ''TVLine'', citing anonymous insiders:

:''"According to multiple insiders, the pilot was 'troubled' from the start, marred by budget overruns, numerous personnel issues, and myriad creative differences." ''<ref>[https://tvline.com/2019/10/29/game-of-thrones-prequel-spinoff-cancelled-hbo-pilot/ Long Night prequel canceled] - ''TVLine'', October 29, 2019</ref>

===''House of the Dragon'': Season 1 {{C|2019-2021}}===
{{Main|House of the Dragon: Season 1}}
Hours after HBO announced the rejection of the Long Night prequel, it released another announcement that it would instead be developing a different prequel titled ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', about the Targaryen civil war known as the [[Dance of the Dragons]] which took place almost two hundred years before ''Game of Thrones''. Unlike the Long Night prequel, the Dance of the Dragons already had extensive prequel novellas to draw from as source material to adapt. HBO also announced that it was foregoing a pilot, instead directly greenlighting ''House of the Dragon'' for a ten episode first season.

Ironically, none of the five potential prequel showrunners initially announced in May 2017 ultimately made the first prequel to air. While a "Dance of the Dragons prequel" was in fact one of the initial five pitches, it had been assigned to [[Bryan Cogman]] - who then left HBO in October 2018 to sign an exclusive five-year development deal with Amazon.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-thrones-final-season-a-knight-seven-kingdoms-writer-bryan-cogman-forecasts-winterfell-battle-1204464 Bryan Cogman prequel rejected,] ''Hollywood Reporter'', April 2019</ref> Cogman explained in a May 2019 interview with ''Vanity Fair'' that he had to divide so much of his attention between his prequel pitch writeup and his work on Season 8 of ''Game of Thrones'' itself that even he felt his take on the subject wasn't as strong as it could have been. Retroactively, this explains why Cogman's pitch was the last of the original five to be finalized, a full four months after all the other pitches were announced as a group - he was struggling to schedule his obligations between it and Season 8.<ref>[https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/05/bryan-cogman-game-of-thrones ''Vanity Fair'',] May 15, 2019</ref> 

Two weeks after ''House of the Dragon'' was announced, ''Deadline'' broke the news that new showrunner [[Ryan Condal]] would be leading the project, along with veteran director [[Miguel Sapochnik]] as co-executive producer. The report also confirmed that Condal wasn't simply taking over Cogman's old pitch, but starting over again from scratch. Condal and Cogman reiterated in several subsequent interviews that ''nothing'' from Cogman's original pitch treatment was re-used for ''House of the Dragon'', rather Condal's new team started over again with only the same basic idea to make "a prequel about the Dance of the Dragons".<ref>[https://deadline.com/2019/09/house-targaryen-prequel-game-of-thrones-series-ryan-condal-george-rr-martin-hbo-1202732221/ ''Deadline'',] September 12, 2019</ref>

In May 2019, George R.R. Martin made another blog update in which he confirmed that one of the four remaining prequel pitches had also been rejected - but he reiterated that besides the Long Night prequel (which had just begun filming its pilot) there were still two other active pitches which were relatively well-developed (one of these two turned out to be ''House of the Dragon''):

:''"Oh, and speaking of television, don’t believe everything you read. Internet reports are notoriously unreliable. We have had five different GAME OF THRONES successor shows in development (I mislike the term 'spinoffs') at HBO, and three of them are still moving forward nicely. The one I am not supposed to call THE LONG NIGHT will be shooting later this year, and two other shows remain in the script stage, but are edging closer. What are they about? I cannot say. But maybe some of you should pick up a copy of FIRE & BLOOD and come up with your own theories."''<ref>[http://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2019/05/04/stuff-and-nonsense-3/ Stuff and Nonsense]</ref>

Soon after these announcements at the end of October, [[David J. Peterson]] subsequently gave an interview on November 12, 2019, with the longrunning podcast series ''Game of Owns'', in which he gave confirmation on several key details:<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llwYVV92g7k ''Game of Owns'',] episode #439, David J. Peterson interview, November 12, 2019</ref>

*Peterson confirmed that the title of the Long Night prequel actually was "Bloodmoon", which had previously been revealed through spy photos of production sheets but never confirmed by HBO. Peterson cautioned, however, that it was only a placeholder/working title, because strictly speaking a TV series title is only "official" when it is formally announced, but HBO never ''officially'' gave this project any public title - and now that it's been rejected, it never will. Peterson briefly said he saw "several" names being used for the project at one time or another, either "The Long Night", "The Age of Heroes", or "Bloodmoon". Nonetheless "Bloodmoon" is the only title that was ever seen in official logos on paperwork from spy reports.
*Peterson confirmed that the third prequel was about "Old Valyria". He had been hired to work on it, expanding the Valyrian language work he did on ''Game of Thrones'', but the project was put on hold.
*Peterson stated that the three prequel pitches that were still active by May 2019 (as cited by Martin) were the Long Night (''Bloodmoon''), the Dance of the Dragons (''House of the Dragon''), and Old Valyria. Peterson stated that all three had advanced to the point that they had screenwriters and series bibles. As for the fourth and fifth prequel pitches, which by that point had been officially rejected, Peterson said he had no idea what they were about - moreover, none of the other producers he works with had any idea what they were about either. Thus both of those ideas were apparently dropped very early in the pitch phase, possibly before they even had pilot scripts.

On April 3, 2021, Max Borenstein gave an interview with ''Collider'' for his new ''Godzilla vs. Kong'' movie, in which he was asked about his prequel pitch. Borenstein said that given the large amount of work he put into the pitch he still wanted to make it someday, and given the recent leadership changes at HBO's parent company combined with their recent expansion with a second wave of prequel pitches, he remained hopeful:

:''"I had an amazing experience with it. We did a tremendous amount of work, I'm really proud of it. And maybe one day it'll have its moment, that's my hope for it...Right now, they're really developing a lot of projects in that world, and I'm doing a different show at the network [about the LA Lakers] that I'm deeply in love with. I am also really in love with that project and would to love to one day be able to do it, so we'll see. It was very developed in terms of the world and the story bible. There was a script, and there were outlines. We had a title, we had a lot of stuff...It's definitely in their court as to what could theoretically get released."''<ref>[https://collider.com/max-borenstein-interview-godzilla-vs-konggame-of-thrones-spinoff-series/ ''Collider'',] April 3, 2021</ref>

Given that David J. Peterson had confirmed that the three prequel pitches which advanced to the point they had story bibles were the Long Night (now rejected), the Dance of the Dragons (greenlit as ''House of the Dragon''), and "Old Valyria", Borenstein's admission that his pitch was very developed to the point it had a story bible indirectly confirmed that the Old Valyria prequel was in fact his prequel pitch. This lends some credence to the earlier leaks from July 2018 concerning the Valyria prequel, though of course it doesn't confirm the more specific details from that leak.

Leading up to the release of Martin's ''Fire & Blood'' on November 20, 2018, Martin admitted that "at least two" of the remaining four prequel pitches were directly based on material in it. ''Fire & Blood'' is an outgrowth of ''The World of Ice & Fire'', an in-universe history book about the first half of the Targaryen dynasty's reign, starting with Aegon I and ending with Aegon III.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/10/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-the-winds-of-winter-interview Guardian interview]</ref> Given that the two major narratives in ''Fire & Blood'' are [[Aegon's Conquest]] and the Dance of the Dragons, by process of elimination, the fourth major pitch was probably about the Targaryen Conquest. The identity of the fifth prequel, which was also rejected early on, remains unknown.

===Second wave of pitches {{C|2021-2022}}===
In spring 2021, it was reported that HBO was considering several new prequel pitches, both live-action and animated. Unlike the first wave of prequel pitches, which were formally announced by HBO itself in one big burst, these new pitches were first learned about in a series of insider leaks posted in major TV industry news sites, which were spread out from late January to late May 2021.

On January 21, 2021, ''Variety'' reported that HBO was considering a live-action adaptation of the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]]. This is intriguing given that Martin said he didn't want to start an adaptation of it until after the prequel novella series is finished: so far only three out of a planned twelve installments were completed. On the other hand there are time skips between novellas on a scale of years, so it's possible that HBO is just considering an adaptation of the first three novellas before going on break.<ref>[https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/game-of-thrones-tales-of-dunk-and-egg-series-hbo-1234889520/ ''Variety'',] January 21, 2021</ref> Hours after ''Variety'' broke this news, ''Entertainment Weekly'''s James Hibberd responded with his own leak, that a live-action [[Robert's Rebellion]] prequel was being considered.<ref>[https://ew.com/tv/game-of-thrones-dunk-and-egg-prequel/ ''EW.com'',] January 21, 2021</ref> A few days later on January 27, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' put out another leak that HBO was considering an adult-oriented animated project, to compete with the recently announced burst of ''Star Wars'' and Marvel animated projects by Disney.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-of-thrones-animated-drama-eyed-at-hbo-max-exclusive-4123015/ ''THR'',] January 27, 2021</ref>

Two months later on March 18, an extensive new leak report came out in ''Deadline'', claiming that three entirely new live-action prequel pitches were being considered: [[Nymeria]] and the 10,000 ships of the [[Rhoynar]], the 9 Voyages of [[Corlys Velaryon]], and one about [[Flea Bottom]]. Corlys Velaryon appears in ''House of the Dragon'' so this would be a direct tie-in to the first major prequel series (basically a "Young Corlys" show). Moreover, ''Deadline'' reported that Bruno Heller (former showrunner of HBO's ''Rome'') was attached to the 9 Voyages series. No further details were given for the pitch about "Flea Bottom" - the worst slum district in King's Landing - such as whether it was set in a specific time period or was an anthology. Given that in his youth [[Daemon Targaryen]] was commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] and essentially took over the city's underbelly and was called "Lord Flea Bottom", this ''might'' have been another ''House of the Dragon'' tie-in, focusing on Young Daemon, but no specific details were given.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2021/03/game-of-thrones-prequels-sea-snake-9-voyages-flea-bottom-10000-ships-bruno-heller-1234717042/ ''Deadline'',] March 18, 2021</ref>

Two weeks later on March 30, George R.R. Martin himself publicly announced that he was developing another prequel, not for television or animation, but as a Broadway stage-play: the story of the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]], the opening event that set [[Robert's Rebellion]] in motion. Martin also promised that the stage play would reveal secrets about what really happened at the Tourney that have never been revealed in the current novels (such as the true details about how [[Jon Snow]]'s parents [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and [[Lyanna Stark]] met and fell in love). The production company had already been hired, and Martin stated that it was set for a 2023 premiere.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-of-thrones-play-in-the-works-for-broadway-will-revive-iconic-characters-exclusive-4153230/ ''THR'',] March 30, 2021</ref>

About a month later on April 22, James Hibberd stated that the Robert's Rebellion prequel project turned out to be the Harrenhal stage play. Martin promised that the stage play will contain new information about how the rebellion started.<ref>[https://winteriscoming.net/2021/04/22/game-of-thrones-never-was-roberts-rebellion-prequel-series/ ''WiC.net'',] April 22, 2021</ref>

One month later on May 25, two months after the leak first came that a Nymeria pitch was being considered, ''Deadline'' posted a new update that screenwriter [[Amanda Segel]] had been hired to write a pilot script for it. This did not mean that a ''Ten Thousand Ships'' prequel had been "greenlit" to series, nor that a pilot had been greenlit yet, but that it had advanced through the production process from the initial pitch phase to the point that a screenwriter had been officially hired to write a formal pilot script.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2021/05/game-of-thrones-amanda-segel-write-10000-ships-spinoff-1234763526/ ''Deadline'',] May 25, 2021</ref>

Subsequently on July 16, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' posted a major update that HBO is not considering only one ''Game of Thrones'' animated project, as previously reported, but at least ''three'' separate animated projects. Moreover, ''THR'' reported that one of these three ideas was specifically about the Golden Empire of [[Yi Ti]] - a land in the distant east of [[Essos]] which is loosely their world's Fantasy analogue of Imperial China (Yi Ti is about as far east of [[Qarth]] as [[Slaver's Bay]] is west of it). Yi Ti hasn't been visited in the main ''A Song of Ice & Fire'' novels, so this project would apparently draw on the extensive chapter about Yi Ti in ''The World of Ice & Fire'', the sourcebook published in 2014.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-of-thrones-animated-yiti-1234982593/ ''THR'',] July 16, 2021</ref>

''THR'''s July 16 report also stated that the proposed "Flea Bottom" prequel had been quietly dropped, also noting that it was only ever "the most nascent" of ideas for a spinoff. It apparently never went beyond the pitch phase and didn't have screenwriters attached - if it ever even was a formal "pitch" or was just an idea that was being informally suggested.<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-of-thrones-animated-yiti-1234982593/ ''THR'',] July 16, 2021</ref>

Much later in June 2022, ''THR'' leaked that a sequel show focusing on [[Jon Snow]] was in development. On June 23, 2022, George R.R. Martin confirmed in a blog post that not only was the project real, but it was the creation of [[Kit Harington]] himself. Moreover, Martin revealed that the project - with the working title "''Snow''" - had been in development for almost as long as the other current pitches, and he considered it co-equal with the other three live-action successor shows. He went on to say that the project was actually so far along in development that Harington had already put together his own team of screenwriters, who had met with Martin in person, and they had already produced multiple draft scripts for it. Martin emphasized, however, that all four of these live-action projects including ''Snow'' have not been greenlit and there is no guarantee that any of them will be produced.<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/06/23/snow-and-other-stuff/ Not a Blog: "SNOW… and Other Stuff",] June 23, 2022</ref>

'''Thus from about 2020 to 2021, the "second wave" of prequel pitches consisted of:'''
*Tales of Dunk & Egg (with Steve Conrad attached)
*9 Voyages of Corlys Velaryon (with Bruno Heller attached)
*Nymeria & the 10,000 Ships of the Rhoynar (with Amanda Segel attached)
*''Snow'' (a sequel focused on Jon Snow, developed by Kit Harington himself)
*Flea Bottom (a nascent idea that was rejected very early on)
*3 animated projects, one of which is Yi Ti
*Quite separately, a Broadway stage-play about the Great Tourney at Harrenhal, produced by George R.R. Martin himself (which has been definitely ordered and is set to premiere in 2023).

It is unknown what sparked this second wave of prequel pitches. It may have simply been a natural outgrowth, due to HBO's wish to expand the ''Game of Thrones'' franchise as its own cinematic universe to compete with expansion by various other streaming platforms, with multiple ''Star Wars'' and Marvel TV projects in development.

At this point in time, it is impossible to know if any of the second wave of pitches revealed in early 2021 are original ideas, or recycled pitches from the first phase under new writers - given that this is exactly what happened to ''House of the Dragon'' itself (the initial pitch by Cogman was actually rejected, but the basic idea to adapt that prequel era was then handed over to a new set of writers). The identity of the fifth pitch was never revealed, and Martin said there was a sixth one at first that HBO rejected out of hand. For all we know, the "fifth prequel" out of the five pitches announced in May 2017 might have been about the 9 Voyages of Corlys Velaryon - or it could be something else entirely. Moreover even if any idea was recycled it might not have the same writers attached in 2021 compared to a full four years before in 2017.

Ryan Condal also revealed that, in some sense, he was both the first ''and'' last screenwriter of the first cycle of pitches for successor shows: he approached George R.R. Martin in early 2016 about doing a ''Tales of Dunk & Egg'' prequel, but Martin himself rejected the idea out of hand at the time because he wanted to finish that series first. Thus Condal's suggestion was never a formal "pitch" and wasn't one of the other ideas HBO rejected early on. After Condal's early suggestion to do ''Dunk & Egg'' was rejected in 2016, he ultimately came back at the end of the first pitch cycle in 2019 to helm ''House of the Dragon''.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5AsnmQUvyI ''WiC.net'',] October 27, 2020]</ref>

On November 30, 2021, {{WPS|Deadline Hollywood|Deadline}} reported that [[Steve Conrad]] was attached as writer and executive producer on a potential pitch for an adaptation of the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]].<ref>[https://deadline.com/2021/11/dunk-egg-steve-conrad-writer-game-of-thrones-prequel-series-hbo-1234881825/ ‘Dunk & Egg’: Steve Conrad To Write ‘Game Of Thrones’ Prequel HBO Series – Deadline]</ref>

On March 9, 2022, George R.R. Martin himself gave an update in his blog that all of the currently known successor shows are proceeding well, confirming that all three have advanced from the "pitch" phase to the "pilot script" phase of development, though it will be some time before HBO might order a pilot to be filmed. He also confirmed that the working titles of the three current live-action successor shows are ''The Sea Snake'' (young Corlys Velaryon), previously known as ''[[Nine Voyages]]'', ''The Hedge Knight'' (Dunk & Egg), and ''[[Ten Thousand Ships]]'' (Nymeria and the Rhoynar). Additionally, Martin confirmed that the three rumored showrunners are in fact attached to each project (Heller, Conrad, Segel). He went on to say that animated projects are also proceeding well, and that the already leaked one about the Golden Empire of Yi Ti has the working title ''[[The Golden Empire]]''. Martin also acknowledged for the first time that the Yi Ti project has moved beyond the opening negotiation phase in that it has a writer attached (he didn't say who) and that he has seen concept art produce which he is very happy with. This does not guarantee that the animated Yi Ti project will ultimately be greenlit.<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/09/random-updates-and-bits-o-news/ Random Updates and Bits o’ News,] GRRM, Not A Blog, March 9, 2022</ref>
