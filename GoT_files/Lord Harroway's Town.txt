'''Lord Harroway's Town'''{{Ref|GOT707}} is a town in the [[Riverlands]], located just upriver along the [[Trident]] from the [[Inn at the Crossroads]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] instructs his military commanders that their remaining forces in the [[Westerlands]] should head east along the [[River Road]], until they meet up at Lord Harroway's Town with their forces from [[King's Landing]] heading west, before advancing north.<ref>"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels, Lord Harroway's Town is much the same. It is currently ruled by House Roote, apparently a relatively minor noble House. It was originally named after a ruler from [[House Harroway]], the second family to hold [[Harrenhal]] after the Targaryen Conquest (following the extinction of [[House Qoherys]] at the hands of a rebel lord). The Harroways held Harrenhal for a scant four years, however, before being wiped out by King [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]].

Lord Harroway's Town is one of the larger market-towns in the Riverlands, along with [[Saltpans]] and [[Fairmarket]]. The Riverlands have no settlement large enough to be called a "city" in them, because for one reason or another various local kings throughout history refused to grant such charters to give them the right to formally expand. Thus the fact that there are no "cities" in the Riverlands can be misleading, as it has a disproportionate amount of fairly large market-towns.

The course of the Trident river shifted about 80 years prior to the War of the Five Kings: the Inn at the Crossroads used to be located on the waterfront with its own ferry dock, so that a traveler could take a ferry straight to Lord Harroway's Town, but after the river banks shifted the Inn is now located some distance inland.

[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] pass through Lord Harroway's Town on their way north to the [[Twins]].
