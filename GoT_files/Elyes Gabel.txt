'''Elyes Cherif Gabel''' (born 8 May 1983) is a British actor. Of Algerian and Indian descent, he was born in London and has also lived in Canada and Manchester. He has appeared in theatrical productions such as [[wikipedia:West Side Story|''West Side Story'']], [[wikipedia:Oliver!|''Oliver!'']] and [[wikipedia:The Diary of Anne Frank (play)|''The Diary of Anne Frank'']]. His first television role was in children's series [[wikipedia:I Love Mummy|''I Love Mummy'']] in 2002. In 2004-2007 he was a regular on the popular British medical series ''[[wikipedia:Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' and was also a regular on the fourth season of [[wikipedia:Waterloo Road|''Waterloo Road'']]. Most recently he has appeared alongside [[Aidan Gillen]] on [[wikipedia:Identity (TV series)|''Identity'']].

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' he plays [[Rakharo]] and was announced in the role on 11 August 2010. Originally he was announced as playing the role of Jhogo, but HBO decided to change the name as it sounded too much like [[Drogo]]. He initially appeared as a guest star in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|first season]] and returned in this role for the first two episodes of the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]].

Gabel was written out of the show in the second season after getting a role on the movie ''[[wikipedia:World War Z (film)|World War Z]]''. Rakharo's activities were, to a certain extent, replaced by the new character of [[Kovarro]], played by [[Steven Cole]].
