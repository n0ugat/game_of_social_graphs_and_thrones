==Biography==
===Background===
Marlow serves as a governess at the [[Red Keep]]. She is [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s tutor.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
As Rhaenyra and [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] study the history of [[Nymeria]] and the [[Rhoynar migration]], Alicent quizzes Rhaenyra on who Nymeria married when she landed in [[Dorne]]. Alicent says that Septa Marlow would be furious at Rhaenyra's answer, "Lord Something," to which Rhaenyra replies that Marlow is funny when she is furious. When Rhaenyra later answers correctly "Lord [[Mors Martell]]," she tears a page from the book and gives it to Alicent. Alicent again brings up Marlow, and Rhaenyra counters "Fuck the septa."{{Ref|HOTD101}}
