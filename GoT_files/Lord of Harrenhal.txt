'''Lord of Harrenhal'''{{Ref|GOT303}} is a title in held by the ruler of [[Harrenhal]], the massive [[Riverlands]] castle built by King [[Harren Hoare]], and its surrounding lands.

Several noble houses have held the title since [[Aegon's Conquest]]. After the death of Harren the Black and his sons, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] granted the castle to [[House Qoherys]] as a reward for its loyalty until the line died out. The following families to rule Harrenhal were the [[House Towers|Towers]], [[House Harroway|Harroways]], [[House Strong|Strongs]], and [[House Lothston|Lothstons]], all of which became extinct, leading to the popular belief that the castle is cursed. Following House Lothston, the [[House Whent|Whents]] become the new Lords of Harrenhal, until the castle is occupied by [[House Lannister]] during the early stage of the [[War of the Five Kings]], while Lady [[Shella Whent]] flees from it.

The title of Lord of Harrenhal is then awarded to [[Janos Slynt]], commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing]], for his role in the betrayal and arrest of [[Eddard Stark]]. Thus, the newly created [[House Slynt]] displaces the nigh-extinct House Whent. However, Lord Janos never takes possession of Harrenhal, as he's stripped of lands and title and exiled to the [[Wall]] by acting [[Hand of the King]] [[Tyrion Lannister]] for his role in [[Joffrey Baratheon|King Joffrey]]'s [[Massacre in King's Landing|purge of all of Robert Baratheon's bastards]] in [[King's Landing]].

Tyrion then offers the title to [[Petyr Baelish]] in exchange for his aid in the liberation of Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], along with the title of Lord Paramount of the Riverlands. However, Baelish obtains Harrenhal from the hands of King Joffrey as a reward for arranging an alliance between Houses Lannister and [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]].

Following the [[Trial of Petyr Baelish]] and the resultant extinction of [[House Baelish]], the title of Lord of Harrenhal remains empty.
