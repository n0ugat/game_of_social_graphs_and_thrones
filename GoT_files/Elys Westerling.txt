{{Quote|My father's knights burst into the hall in time to see the last of it, so there was no way for me to vanish and let some bragger steal the glory or blame. I knew at once when I saw the way they looked at me. It would be blame. Lannister or no, I'd been one of Aerys's Kingsguard. I commanded them to announce that the Mad King was dead and to spare all those who yielded. They asked me if they should proclaim a new king as well. I knew what they meant. Would it be my father, or Robert Baratheon, or maybe the child Viserys who'd fled to Dragonstone?|[[Jaime Lannister]]|Robert's Rebellion - Jaime Lannister}}
'''Elys Westerling'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Westerling]] during the reign of [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. He participated in the [[Sack of King's Landing]].

==Biography==
After [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] killed the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], Ser Elys and more of [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s knights entered the [[Red Keep]] hall, and saw Jaime standing over Aerys's body. They incorrectly assumed Jaime killed the king in order to give the throne to his father, and asked him whether they should proclaim a new king. Jaime considered naming [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]], but fearing that the boy would grow to be like his monstrous father, he just said "Proclaim who you bloody well like".{{Ref|H&L606}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Elys Westerling is mentioned only once and very briefly, in Jaime's flashback about the aforementioned event,{{Bookref|ASOS|11}} as narrated in ''[[Histories & Lore]]''.

It is unknown whether Ser Elys is still alive, and what is his exact kinship to the main branch of House Westerling.
