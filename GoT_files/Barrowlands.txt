[[Eddard Stark]] and [[Robert Baratheon]] hold a meeting in this area on their way south, discussing the marriage of [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to Khal [[Drogo]]. Robert is impressed with the countryside.<ref>[[The Kingsroad]]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Barrowlands are so-called for the number of tombs and barrows in the area, extending over a vast territory and dating back to the days of the [[First Men]].

In the novel ''A Game of Thrones'', Robert and Eddard's meeting is much as in the TV series. However, Robert also asks Eddard why the area is so lightly populated and Eddard jokes that Robert's huge travelling party scared all the people away.
