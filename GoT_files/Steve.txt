'''Steve''' was a member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Steve is a member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]. It is not clear whether he was one of the rogue members, but it is possible as he is in the company of [[Gatins]] and not with the main group.{{Ref|GOT608}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Gatins is bragging about what an excellent kisser he was and asks Steve and [[Riddell]] if they want to learn. Steve stands and is on the receiving end of a prank when Gatins sticks his finger down the back of Steve's pants. Steve begins hurling insults at Gatins until he realizes his companions are tensing at the approach of a stranger. He turns just in time for [[Sandor Clegane]] to remove his head with an axe.{{Ref|GOT608}}
