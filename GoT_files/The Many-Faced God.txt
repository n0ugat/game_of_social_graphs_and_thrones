{{Premise|H&L512}}

==Narration==
'''Jaqen H'ghar''': ''A young man walks beside a girl across a flowered field. Spring has come, and this girl is his life. He prays.''

''A child climbs a tree to watch the sunset over the fields. Summer is ending, and the harvest is life for his village. He prays.''

''A hunter tracks a boar through the woods. [[Westeros#Climate and seasons|Winter]] is coming, and this boar is life for his family. He prays.''

''But to whom do they pray?''

''The world has as many answers as there are men to answer, but walk far enough, climb high enough, hunt long enough, and a man shall find only one. One god with many faces.''

''In the [[Faith of the Seven]], He is the [[Stranger]], who guides men from this life to the next. Few seek his favor, or at least few realize that they do.''

''In the [[North]] of [[Westeros]], He is one of the nameless [[Old Gods]], staring out from the [[weirwood]] trees and the snow.''

''In the [[Iron Islands]], He is the [[Drowned God]], calling men down to his watery hall. "What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."''

''In the [[Yi Ti|Far East]], He is the [[Lion of Night]], who fathered the world's [[God-on-Earth|first emperor]] on the [[Maiden-Made-of-Light]], and whose wrath [[Long Night|nearly ended the world]].''

''In [[Volantis]], He is the [[Lord of Light]], whose [[Red priest|followers]] feed men to the flames to beg his favor.''

''In [[Lys]], He is the [[Weeping Lady]], who sheds her tears for the living soon to die.''

''In [[Qohor]], He is the [[Black Goat]], and He feeds on blood offerings every day.''

''On holy days, He is offered condemned criminals, and in times of great crisis, He may even be offered the nobles' children of the city to beg his protection. Does he accept their gift? Well, the city still stands.''

''For the poor, He is the [[Hooded Wayfarer]]. For soldiers, He is [[Bakkalon|Bakkalon, the Pale Child]]. For sailors, He is the [[Moon-Pale Maiden]] and the [[Merling King]].''

''In the [[House of Black and White]], however, He is all of them, and none of them.''

''He is the [[Many-Faced God]], and wherever a man turns, there He is. Men come from every corner of the world to know Him, to beg His favor, and seek His gift.''

''For themselves, if their life has grown too hard, or for others who are making it so. It is all the same to the Many-Faced-God.''

''"Valar dohaeris," all men must serve Him, beggars and kings. "Valar morghulis," all men must die, good and evil. Men worship as they will, but at the end of every road stands the Many-Faced God, waiting.''
