'''Aggo''' was a [[Dothraki]] warrior who escorted a captive [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to [[Vaes Dothrak]]. He was killed by [[Daario Naharis]], whilst saving Jorah Mormont during their attempt to rescue Daenerys.

==Biography==
===Background===
Aggo is a Dothraki warrior serving in the ''[[khalasar]]'' of ''[[Khal]]'' [[Moro]].{{Ref|GOT601}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Aggo and [[Qhono]] comment on [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] as they are bringing her to Khal Moro.{{Ref|GOT601}}

Once in [[Vaes Dothrak]], Aggo and his companion [[Iggo]] encounter [[Jorah Mormont]] and [[Daario Naharis]] as they attempt to infiltrate in the holy city. Aggo sees through Jorah's claim to being a wine merchant and orders his companion to raise the alarm. Jorah attacks Aggo but as both are unarmed, the younger and larger Dothraki begins to overpower the older knight, beating him severely. Jorah attempts to blind Aggo with a thrown handful of sand, but misses. Aggo seizes Jorah by the throat and begins to choke the life from him, but is fatally stabbed in the back by Daario. To hide Aggo's stab wound, as weapons are forbidden in the holy city, Daario repeatedly bludgeons Aggo's corpse with a large rock.{{Ref|GOT604}}

Later, the great Khals discuss Aggo's death. Khal Moro notes that Aggo, a rider in his ''khalasar'', served him well, yet nonchalantly dismisses his death for the way in which he was killed.{{Ref|GOT604}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the only Dothraki named Aggo is [[Aggo (The North Remembers)|Daenerys's bloodrider]]. However, Daenerys's storyline has surpassed the latest published novel, ''A Dance with Dragons'', so Aggo or an equivalent character may appear in the upcoming novels.
