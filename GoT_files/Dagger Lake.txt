'''Dagger Lake'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a lake in western-central [[Essos]], formed by the confluence of the [[Rhoyne]] and the [[Qhoyne]]. It is adjacent to the [[Golden Fields]], north of [[Volantis]] and south of [[Qohor]] and [[Norvos]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Dagger Lake is an important landmark along the length of the Rhoyne. The lake lies outside of the territories controlled by Norvos, Qohor, and Volantis, meaning that numerous river pirates operate on and near the lake. It is another border zone, somewhat like the [[Stepstones]] (which are also filled with pirates), claimed by many but truly controlled by none. Volantis's area of control only begins south of the Sorrows and ruins of [[Chroyane]].
