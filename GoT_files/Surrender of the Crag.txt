The '''surrender of the Crag''' is an event in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. 

==History==
===Prelude===
Having won victories in the [[Riverlands]], among them the [[Battle of Oxcross]], the [[taking of Ashemark]] and a [[battle at the Yellow Fork]], King [[Robb Stark]]'s army has established a strong foothold in the [[Westerlands]].<ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref><ref name="E14">"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref><ref name="E17">"[[A Man Without Honor]]"</ref> The victory at Oxcross has left the region lightly defended.<ref name="E14"/>

===Surrender===
Robb leads part of his force to the Crag to negotiate the surrender of [[House Westerling]], a proud but impoverished vassal house of [[House Lannister]]. He is accompanied by the battlefield surgeon [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]] who uses the opportunity to obtain supplies from the castle's [[Order of Maesters|maester]].<ref name="E17"/>

===Aftermath===
Robb returns from the mission without incident. However, while he was away, his key prisoner [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] was released by [[Catelyn Stark|his mother]] without his consent. The betrayal, combined with the ongoing worry about his siblings captivity, causes Robb to seek solace in the arms of Talisa, flouting his vow to marry into [[House Frey]].<ref>"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Crag surrenders only after losing a battle for control of the castle.

The Crag is stormed at night. While [[Smalljon Umber]] and [[Walder Rivers|Black Walder Frey]] lead scaling parties over the walls, Robb breaks through the main gate with a ram, but is injured by an arrow wound.

Robb is wounded in the battle and he is nursed back to health by [[Talisa Stark#In the books|Jeyne Westerling]] (Talisa's book counterpart), the daughter of the Lord of the Crag. Shortly afterwards, Robb learns of the alleged deaths of [[Bran Stark|his]] [[Rickon Stark|brothers]] at the hand of [[Theon Greyjoy]], and in his grief he sleeps with Jeyne. Having taken Jeyne's maidenhood, Robb feels honor-bound to marry her, in spite of his betrothal to a daughter of [[Walder Frey]].
