==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Merryweather was once a rich and powerful family.

After [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] resigned his position as [[Hand of the King]], Lord [[Owen Merryweather]] was named the new Hand by the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. Aerys stripped the Merryweathers from their lands and exiled Owen for his failure to prevent [[Robert's Rebellion]].{{Bookref|ASOS|11}}

After [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] seized the [[Iron Throne]], he restored the Merryweathers' title and some of their lands, but the family's wealth and status has not yet completely recovered.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', Lord Orton and his wife arrive at King's Landing.{{Bookref|ASOS|6}} Following [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's death]], Taena is one of the numerous false witnesses who testify against [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]].{{Bookref|ASOS|66}}
