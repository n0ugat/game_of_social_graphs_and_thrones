==Narration==
'''Robert Baratheon''': ''[[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]] was the last of his name to sit on the [[Iron Throne]]. Known far and wide as "the Mad King," his was a reign of instability and terror. The [[Seven Kingdoms]] are well-rid of him and his kind.''

''Oh, he may have appeared to be a capable ruler at first, but that was due in no small part to his councilors led by the [[Hand of the King]], [[Tywin Lannister]]. There may have been years of peace and prosperity during Aerys's reign, but it was Tywin who was really running the country as Aerys spiraled further and further into insanity.''

''The dragonspawn were famous for losing their minds. It was the price they paid for centuries of keeping the bloodlines pure. And Aerys more than happily continued the noble sister-fucking tradition of his forefathers.''

''As the years passed, Aerys's behavior became increasingly erratic.'' ''He cut himself so often on his [[Iron Throne]], many referred to him as "King Scab," though never to his face.''

''It was rumored he had developed an obsession with [[wildfire]], and was known to inflict horrific punishments on those he considered enemies, including burning them alive.''

''As his paranoia and bloodlust grew, he had a bitter falling out with Lord Tywin, who had served the Crown faithfully for twenty years.''

''At least Tywin was able to leave the job with his life and fortunes intact. Subsequent Hands of King Aerys weren't so fortunate.''

''Then the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] went too far. The Crown Prince, [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], abducted [[Lyanna Stark]], daughter of [[Rickard Stark]], the [[Lord of Winterfell]].''

''She was my betrothed. She was my beloved — beautiful and spirited woman.''

''And I loved her more than life itself.''

''Rhaegar went south with Lyanna, hiding her away in [[Dorne]]. What harm he inflicted on the poor girl, the gods only know. [[Brandon Stark]], Lyanna's eldest brother, was outraged.''

''He rode to [[King's Landing]] to confront the king and demand his sister's safe return. Instead, Aerys had him [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|executed]]. His father, Rickard Stark, as well. There wasn't much left to discuss after that.''

''Aerys feared their loved ones would seek revenge for what he did. He was right to be afraid.''

''Aerys wasted no time in calling for the heads of Brandon's younger brother, my friend [[Eddard Stark]], and my head, too, of course. I'm sorry he didn't come looking for it himself.''

''Alongside [[Jon Arryn]] of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] (the man who fostered Ned and I as children), [[House Baratheon|Baratheons]], Starks, and [[House Tully|Tullys]] all called their banners. Once our [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] began, the Mad King's days were numbered.''
