'''Lord of the Seven Kingdoms'''{{Ref|GOT101}}{{Note|Feminine: '''Lady of the Seven Kingdoms'''{{Ref|HOTD110}}}} is the second title held by the ruler of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], along with [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King/Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]] and [[Protector of the Realm]]. This title has previously been combined with the latter to become [[Protector of the Seven Kingdoms]] under Queens [[Cersei Lannister]]{{Ref|GOT610}} and [[Daenerys Targaryen]].{{Ref|GOT703}}

Following a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]] and the realm's reformation into the [[Six Kingdoms]], the title has been changed accordingly to '''Lord of the Six Kingdoms'''.{{Ref|GOT806}}

==Inspiration==
This is loosely comparable to how some real-life medieval monarchies continued to claim titles that they no longer possessed ''de facto''. The kings of England styled themselves "King of France" long after the English had lost all their French territory and any prospect of reclaiming it, and "Lord of Ireland" when they had little practical control of the country. The oddity of the early Targaryen kings laying claim to Dorne is that, unlike English kings who lost territory in Ireland but still claimed it, the Targaryens never conquered Dorne, nor did they have any other real legal claim to it.

==In the books==
Every king of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] held the title "Lord of the Seven Kingdoms", dating back to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] himself, even though Aegon was never able to conquer [[Dorne]]. He thus only controlled six of the seven kingdoms plus the [[Riverlands]], which historically has never been counted as one of the "seven". Dorne only joined the Targaryen realm through peaceful marriage-alliance fully two centuries after [[Aegon's Conquest]] (about one century before the [[War of the Five Kings]]).

When Aegon I began his conquest of Westeros, he unilaterally declared himself king and lord of all of the Seven Kingdoms, before proceeding to actually conquer kingdoms such as the [[Reach]] or the [[Westerlands]]. Aegon's armies were repulsed from Dorne due to guerrilla warfare - but he never stopped claiming the title. Subsequent Targaryen kings continued to use the title "Lord of the Seven Kingdoms" as a tacit declaration that they still laid claim to Dorne and intended to conquer it eventually. A century and a half later, King [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron I]] even managed to briefly conquer Dorne, but the occupation was thrown off and it remained independent for another half century.
