'''Valysar'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a town in western [[Essos]]. The city is located north-west of [[Volantis]] on the western bank of the [[Rhoyne]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Valysar is a vassal town of [[Volantis]]. As it is located on the western side of the river, it does not have any fear of the [[Dothraki]] or a need to pay them tribute, unlike its sister-city of [[Selhorys]] to the north. Valysar is a middling-sized town by the standards of the [[Free Cities]], but would be a small city by [[Westeros]]i standards.
