==Narration==
'''Robert Baratheon''': ''Rebellion! The crimes of House Targaryen were too heinous to go unanswered. The noble Houses of [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]], [[House Stark|Stark]], and [[House Arryn|Arryn]], united to oppose and overthrow the line of the cursed dragon kings.''

''While [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] and [[Jon Arryn|Arryn]] secured an alliance with the [[House Tully|Tullys]] of [[Riverrun]], I called the banners of [[Storm's End]] and rode out in force against the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] and his minions. Gods, those were some battles!''

''Our first [[Battle of Summerhall|victory]] occurred at [[Summerhall]] where I faced off against an army of dragon loyalists and won three battles in a single day, three in one day! Seven hells, that was a glorious day!''

''We tried to take [[Ashford|Ashford Castle]] in the [[Reach]], but the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] beat us back. We had to regroup. My army was pursued north by Aerys's army and took refuge in the [[Stoney Sept]] in the [[Riverlands]].''

''When the Targaryen army entered the town, the [[sept]] bells tolled, a signal to the townspeople of the battle that was to come. As the Targaryens searched from house to house for me, the combined forces of Ned Stark and the Tullys swept into the city.''

''Gods, what a day that was! It's now known as the [[Battle of the Bells]]. We overwhelmed the Mad King's forces and sent them scampering back to [[King's Landing]].''

''Aerys's son, [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], who started the whole damn thing, finally emerged from hiding in the South and assembled his own army to face us. As for the Mad King, he must have been pissing himself.''

''The battle that would decide the fate of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] occurred at the crossing of the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]] river. Rhaegar commanded the royal host, which was some forty thousand strong.''

''My forces were outnumbered by nearly five thousand men, but that didn't matter. They were fresh, but we were battle-hardened and had justice on our side.''

''As the battle raged around us, I faced off with Rhaegar. The stag and the dragon right there in the ford of the river. I fought with the fury of ten men, raining blow after blow upon that vile prince before burying my war hammer in his chest.''

''I hit him so hard, the rubies on his armor broke free, flinging them into the stream. They call it the [[Ruby Ford]] now.''

''With that scum Rhaegar dead and the royal army shattered, our next move was to make for King's Landing. But I'd sustained a few wounds in the battle and was unable to ride. I sent Ned Stark to the capital to face the Mad King and make him pay for his crimes.''
