'''Quentyn Ball'''{{Con|D&EN}} was the [[master-at-arms]] at the [[Red Keep]] during the reign of [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]].

==Biography==
Quentyn trained the young [[Daemon Blackfyre]] at arms.{{Ref|H&L803}}

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' and the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Quentyn was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of House Ball, an ancient house of the [[Reach]]. Known as Fireball for his red hair and hot temper, he took a red and yellow fireball on a night black field for his personal coat-of-arms. He served as master-at-arms at the Red Keep and taught all of Aegon IV's sons to fight.

Quentyn was promised a place in the [[Kingsguard]] by King Aegon, but years later, [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]] refused him and named Ser [[Willem Wylde]] instead. This caused him to be disgruntled with the king; he allegedly convinced Daemon Blackfyre to press his claim alongside [[Aegor Rivers|Bittersteel]]. He also rescued Daemon when the king attempted to have him arrested.

Quentyn was one of the foremost [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre]] commanders in the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]. He was killed by an archer when he stopped for a drink of water on the eve of the [[Battle of Redgrass Field|Battle of the Redgrass Field]].

Ser Glendon Flowers claims to be Quentyn's son, calling himself "Glendon Ball" and carrying the Fireball arms. No one takes him seriously, however, and he is mocked as the "Knight of the Pussywillows" in reference to the [[Prostitution|brothel]] he grew up in.
