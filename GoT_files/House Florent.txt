{{Quote|House Florent, who had actual blood ties to the [[House Gardener|Gardeners]]. They whinge about their ancient rights to [[Highgarden]] every once in a while; and now that [[Selyse Baratheon|their daughter]] is married to [[Stannis Baratheon]], about their rights to all of [[Westeros]], too. Apparently, putting a fox on your banners doesn't impart a fox's wiles.|[[Margaery Tyrell]]|The Reach}}
'''House Florent'''{{Ref|H&L312}} of [[Brightwater Keep]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to Lord [[Bronn]] of [[Highgarden]]. The Florent [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a red-gold fox on an [[Wikipedia:Ermine (heraldry)|ermine]] background.

House Florent had close ties to [[House Gardener]] when they were the [[King of the Reach|Kings of the Reach]] prior to [[Aegon's Conquest]]. House Tyrell were installed as [[Warden of the South|Wardens of the South]] after [[King]] [[Mern IX Gardener]] was killed [[Field of Fire|fighting]] [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. House Florent resents the elevation of House Tyrell and believe they have a more valid claim to the position.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/locations/brightwater-keep/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 map, Brightwater Keep entry]</ref> They fought for [[Stannis Baratheon]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]] as [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse Florent]] was the wife of Stannis.<ref name="E19">"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

House Florent follows their liege lords, House Tyrell, in pledging support to [[Renly Baratheon]]'s claim to the [[Iron Throne]]. Following the [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|Renly's death]], however, the Florents do not follow their Tyrell overlords, but go over to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], as [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse Florent]] is the wife of Stannis.<ref>Season 2 Bluray: War of the Five Kings feature</ref> They participate in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].<ref name="E19"/>

==Family tree==
{{Florent tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Florents, like the Tyrells, claim descent from the extinct House Gardener, the royal line of the defunct Kings of the Reach. The Florents are known to chafe at the fealty owed to House Tyrell. The Florents believe that they have a superior line of descent, and by rights should possess Highgarden. While many Houses in the Reach can claim some descent from House Gardener, the Florents were a [[cadet branch]] of the Gardeners (descended from a younger son), while the Tyrells can only claim descent from the Gardeners through the female line. Physically, Florents are known for having large and prominent ears.

The [[heraldry]] of House Florent in the books is inconsistently described, but apparently consists of a red-gold fox's head, encircled by lapis lazuli flowers, all of which is on an ermine background. The TV version simply omits the lapis lazuli flowers (and predominantly shows a full-bodied fox).

During the [[War of the Five Kings]], the Florents initially declare for [[Renly Baratheon]] along with the rest of the noble Houses in the Reach, but following the latter's assassination, they defy the Tyrells and join [[Stannis Baratheon]], becoming one of the few Houses of the Reach not to join their Tyrell overlords in switching their allegiance to House Lannister.
