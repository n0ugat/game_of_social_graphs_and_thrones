'''Jim Stanes''' is the lead Graphic Artist for ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Stanes has previously worked as a Graphic Artist for the films ''Timeline'', ''Troy'', ''Kingdom of Heaven'', ''The Da Vinci Code'', and ''The Golden Compass''.

Jim Stanes is responsible for creating all of the numerous [[heraldry]] designs seen in HBO's ''Game of Thrones'' TV series adaptation.

Stanes also creates all of the maps seen on-screen in the TV series, such as the illuminated parchment map that the [[House Stark|Starks]] use in their war council scenes in [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]].

In addition, Stanes is responsible for creating ''all'' of the hand-written letters and books in the TV series. Stanes doesn't create the prop books, but the actual writing on their pages - entire volumes worth of material which often is barely glimpsed on-screen.
