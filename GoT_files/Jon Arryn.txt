{{Quote|The seed is strong.|Jon Arryn's last words.|Lord Snow}}
Lord '''Jon Arryn''' was the [[Defender of the Vale]], [[Warden of the East]], and the head of [[House Arryn]]. He served as the first [[Hand of the King]] to [[Robert Baratheon]] until he died under [[Assassination of Jon Arryn|mysterious circumstances]].

==Biography==
===Background===
[[File:King Robert Baratheon Hand Jon Arryn.jpg|thumb|Jon Arryn held the realm together for King Robert.]]
He was the head of [[House Arryn]], one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. Jon was the Warden of the East and Defender of the Vale. He was a respected nobleman and fostered both [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Robert Baratheon]] during their adolescence.<ref name="Jon Arryn viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/arryn/jon-arryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Arryn - Jon Arryn entry]</ref> The [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] condoned the alleged [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapping]] of Eddard's sister, Lyanna, who was also Robert's betrothed, and demanded that Eddard and Robert, still in the Vale, be turned over to the King's justice. Instead, Lord Arryn rebelled, calling his banners to war. [[House Stark]] and [[House Baratheon]] followed suit. The rebels forged an alliance with [[House Tully]] through marriage, with Eddard married to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]] and the then-elderly Jon to the young [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa Tully]].<ref name="Jon Arryn viewers guide"/>{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Jon_Arryn_Hand.png|thumb|left|Jon Arryn serving as Hand of the King.]]
After the rebel victory in the war, Robert acceded to the throne and appointed Jon as his [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. Jon served the realm well for many years as Hand of the King. Indeed, Jon Arryn was essentially the man really holding the realm together for the next seventeen years, while Robert drank, ate and whored his way through his reign.{{Ref|GOT101}}

Jon Arryn eventually died in [[King's Landing]], sparking King Robert's search for a replacement. Jon is survived by his wife Lysa and their six-year-old son, [[Robin Arryn]].{{Ref|GOT101}} Near the end of his life, Jon was investigating the legitimacy of the children of Queen Consort, [[Cersei Lannister]]. He later died from unknown, and unexplained, causes just after discovering the secret that the children were not the seed of Robert Baratheon.{{Ref|GOT107}}

His dying words were to Robert Baratheon, "The seed is strong."{{Ref|GOT103}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Jon Arryn Silent Sisters Funeral.jpg|thumb|[[Silent Sisters]] perform the funeral ceremony for Jon Arryn.]]
Jon Arryn's body is laid out in state in the throne room of the [[Red Keep]] in King's Landing. [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] discuss Jon's attempts to learn the truth about their incestuous relationship and his failure to do so. Later, news of Jon's death reaches Eddard at [[Winterfell]], who is shocked and upset as he considered Jon a second father. Catelyn then receives a letter from Lysa accusing House Lannister of murdering Jon.{{Ref|GOT101}}

When Eddard attends his first [[Small Council]] meeting in King's Landing, he is shocked to learn that the realm is six million [[Money|gold dragons]] in debt, and refuses to believe that Arryn would let this happen. [[Pycelle]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] explain to Eddard that while Jon gave wise and prudent advice, Robert did not always follow it.{{Ref|GOT103}}

Arryn had asked Pycelle for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', a book detailing genealogies of the nobility, which notes the hereditary preponderance for black hair in [[House Baratheon]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

Eddard is told that Arryn visited an armorer, [[Tobho Mott]], several times before his death and also talked with his apprentice [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], inquiring about his mother. On meeting Gendry, Eddard realizes almost immediately that he is King Robert's [[bastard]] son.{{Ref|GOT104}} On the day Arryn died, he met with [[Mhaegen]], a prostitute at [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]'s brothel. She showed him her infant daughter, [[Barra]], who was fathered by Robert.{{Ref|GOT105}}

[[Varys]] privately warns Eddard that he thinks Arryn was murdered by an unknown party for asking too many questions, using a rare and untraceable poison known as the [[Tears of Lys]].{{Ref|GOT105}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Under forceful interrogation by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], Pycelle confesses that he knew that Arryn had unearthed the truth upon seeing Robert's [[bastard]] children that Cersei's three children were not conceived by Robert, but by her twin brother. Pycelle states that Arryn intended to act and reveal his discovery to Robert. When Tyrion accuses Pycelle of having Jon poisoned to keep the truth from getting out, he angrily denies that. Tyrion then points out that Pycelle must have realized that ''someone'' had poisoned Arryn (i.e. that he wasn't simply sick), but he let him succumb anyway, so he has Pycelle thrown into the [[Black Cells]].{{Ref|GOT203}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After being reunited with Littlefinger, Lysa obsessively declares her love for him, stating the things she has done to demonstrate it, including lacing Jon's wine with Tears of Lys, then sending a letter to Catelyn accusing House Lannister of the assassination.{{Ref|GOT405}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Eventually, Littlefinger is forced to answer for his many crimes, including his role in the [[Assassination of Jon Arryn]], when [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] unexpectedly puts him on [[Trial of Petyr Baelish|trial]]. Sansa publicly accuses Littlefinger of persuading Lysa (whom Littlefinger also murdered) to poison Jon and write a letter to her sister, falsely accusing the Lannisters of killing her husband, igniting the conflict between the two great houses. Sansa has [[Arya Stark|Arya]] slit his throat, exacting justice for Jon.{{Ref|GOT707}}

==Behind the scenes==
Originally it was intended that Jon Arryn's death in [[King's Landing]] would open the series, following the depiction of the book's prologue, and the event would be discussed by [[Pycelle]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] in a new scene not in the books. This scene was not filmed for the [[Pilot (Game of Thrones)|pilot]] in favor of retaining the opening of the novel. Jon Arryn was played in these scenes by [[John Standing]].

In a November 2015 interview, Standing described the death scene he filmed: Jon Arryn is feverish and bedridden (from being poisoned), but with a last desperate burst of strength he drags himself across the floor from his bed to a writing desk, and from the ground he reaches for the pen and ink on it. As he pulls it down his strength fails him, however, and he ends up spilling the ink pot all over himself. In his last seconds of life he feebly attempts to move his hand to write something with the pen - only for Cersei ([[Lena Headey]]) to stamp on his fingers to stop him, at which he dies from the poison. Standing said that filming was difficult because he found out the night before that his younger brother had died (though filming had been scheduled for weeks in advance).<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEiUPb0iUWQ</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jon Arryn is a great lord, wise counselor, and canny tactician. He is loved as a second father by both Eddard and Robert, and commanded great respect in the [[Vale of Arryn]]. His nephew and heir Elbert Arryn was among [[Brandon Stark]]'s companions who were imprisoned and killed by the Mad King, sparking Jon Arryn's decision to join the rebellion. Following the rebellion's end, Jon's first act as Hand was to travel to [[Dorne]] and negotiate peace with [[House Martell]] who, outraged at the murders of Princess [[Elia Martell]], her [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|son]], and her [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|daughter]] during the [[Sack of King's Landing]], were willing to continue fighting in [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]]'s name. Jon brought the bones of Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]]'s uncle, the [[Kingsguard]] knight [[Lewyn Martell]], who'd been slain at the [[Battle of the Trident|Trident]], with him so the Martells could give him a proper burial and convinced the Martells to accept Robert's rule. According to [[Oberyn Martell]], during the negotiations, Doran compelled Jon to divulge the identity of Elia's [[Gregor Clegane|killer]].

Jon Arryn's first wife, Lady Jeyne Royce, died in childbirth, and their daughter was stillborn. His second wife, Rowena, died without issue. Lysa Tully, some forty years his junior, became his third wife as part of an alliance with Lord [[Hoster Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. The marriage was loveless and produced only one surviving child, the sickly Robert.

In the books, [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] discovers that Arryn and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] inquired together about Cersei's children and Robert's bastards. In fact it was Stannis who initiated the investigation, while in the TV series he is not mentioned at all in respect of Arryn's actions prior to his death – this was likely changed so that TV-first viewers weren't confused about the actions of yet another unseen character.

When Tyrion confronts Pycelle with his guards, Pycelle admits that Jon Arryn was being treated by Maester Colemon, who gave him purges to get the poison out; that treatment might have cured Arryn. Pycelle, aware that Arryn knew the secret of Cersei's incest, sent the other maester away and just gave Arryn [[Milk of the poppy|painkillers]] to ease his passing. In the TV series the emphasis is slightly different: Pycelle presents it as that he simply didn't intervene when he realized Arryn was poisoned, though Tyrion points out that even his inaction when he could have saved Lord Arryn makes him an accomplice to the murder. In the TV series, Tyrion just vaguely asserts that Pycelle must have "made sure he succumbed", but in the book version he goes slightly beyond inaction, deliberately dismissing a maester who might have saved him.

Even in the books, Pycelle does not know who actually poisoned Jon Arryn, but it is convenient for Pycelle that someone else poisoned him before he had to deal with it.

In the book, Lysa blurts out the whole truth about Arryn's death while she is dragging Sansa to the Moon Door. Littlefinger tries in vain to hush Lysa, feeling uncomfortable that she reveals this secret in the presence of Sansa and [[Marillion#In the novels|someone else]].

Lysa's reason for poisoning Jon is actually a little less obsessive, but just as selfish: he planned to sent their son to Dragonstone to be fostered by Stannis, in keeping with accepted tradition for noble boys in the [[Seven Kingdoms]], and the fact that Stannis was the only one – aside from Ned – he could trust. This didn't matter at all to Lysa of course, as she could not bear the thought of being separated from her son.

Littlefinger apparently wanted Arryn dead to trick the Starks and Lannisters into fighting each other (aided by the letter he had Lysa write to Catelyn), and also so he could later marry Lysa and take control of the Vale. Thus while the situation was the same in the books, Lysa's motivation and Pycelle's role were a little more complicated.
