==Narration==
'''Jorah Mormont''': ''[[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]] was not the first to conquer the world. In the [[Dawn Age|Dawn of Days]], the city of [[Old Ghis|Ghis]] opened its gates and poured forth its [[Ghiscari legions|legions]] across the continent of [[Essos]].''

''With their lockstep discipline and absolute obedience, they ground entire nations beneath their boots and planted the [[Harpy]] in every corner of the [[known world]]. What they didn't destroy, they chained.''

''[[Slavery]] is as old as man, but until the [[Ghiscari]], it was never an art.''

''The slave lords grew rich and fat as pyramids were raised around them, [[Pleasure house|pleasure houses]] were filled, and [[Fighting pit|fighting pits]] were opened. Nobody remembers if the waters around Ghis had names before the [[Ghiscari Empire|Empire]], but ever since they have been known only as "[[Slaver's Bay]]" and the "[[Gulf of Grief]]."''

''Of Ghis, however, nothing remains but ruins, where end all great civilizations.''

''Five thousand years ago, Valyrian shepherds stumbled on [[Dragon|strange eggs]], and within a few generations, an upstart [[Valyrian Freehold]] rose across the sea.''

''[[Ghiscari wars|Five times]] did the Ghiscari contend with Valyria, and five times did they go down in defeat. For the Freehold had dragons, and the [[Ghiscari Empire|Empire]] had none. The best of their legions burned, the others broke.''

''The brick walls of Ghis were pulled down, the streets and buildings turned to ash, and the very fields sown with salt, sulfur, and skulls.''

''Yet the Empire was not wholly destroyed. [[Astapor]], [[Yunkai]], and [[Meereen]], once lowly colonies along Slaver's Bay, survived, and even thrived. Valyria had watched the Ghiscari grow rich and powerful off the backs of conquered peoples, and now the self-styled Freehold wanted its turn.''

''While the [[dragonlord]]s brought the world to heel, the slave markets of their former enemy never lacked for flesh.''

''Lamenting the lost empire, the [[Ghiscari|descendants]] of Old Ghis grew rich and fat. The [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]] fell on Valyria, and the [[Dothraki]] [[Century of Blood|rose]] to pillage most of the continent at will.''

''But gold-laden Astapor, Yunkai, and Meereen continue as they have for thousands of years. Untouched. For even the horselords understand what the Ghiscari taught Valyria so long ago. What good are slaves without slavers?''

==Behind the scenes==
*Jorah states that "Slaver's Bay", as well as the "Gulf of Grief", were always known by these names (in their local languages) even during the time of the old Ghiscari Empire five thousand years ago. Previously, it wasn't clear if they only became known by these names ''after'' the fall of Valyria four hundred years ago.
