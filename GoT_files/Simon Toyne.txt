{{Quote|Good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina.|[[Barristan Selmy]]|Lord Snow}}
'''Simon Toyne''' was the leader of the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]], an [[outlaw]] brotherhood. He was killed by Ser [[Barristan Selmy]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Simon Toyne was the leader of the Kingswood Brotherhood, a band of outlaws and bandits opposed to the rule of [[House Targaryen]]. They inhabited the [[Kingswood]], a large area of woodland south-east of [[King's Landing]]. Roughly twenty years before the events of the series, King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] ordered the Brotherhood destroyed, a mission led by Ser Barristan Selmy of the [[Kingsguard]]. Selmy himself killed Toyne with a counter-riposte, a move witnessed by the then-[[squire]] [[Jaime Lannister]].{{Ref|GOT103}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Jaime recalls Selmy killing Toyne and cites Selmy's counter-riposte as the finest sword move he'd ever seen. Selmy says that Toyne was a good fighter, but lacked stamina.{{Ref|GOT103}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Simon was a descendant of [[House Toyne]]. His background and fate are the same as in the show.

House Toyne was formerly a house of honor, with one member - Ser [[Terrence Toyne]] - serving in the Kingsguard of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]]. When Aegon IV found this knight abed with one of his mistresses, he had him executed in a horrible fashion. The knight's brothers declared war against [[House Targaryen]], slaying the infamous Dragonknight, Ser [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon Targaryen]]. Simon was their descendant and the last of his line.
