==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
He is present at the [[kingsmoot on Old Wyk]] and he interrupts [[Yara Greyjoy]]'s speech because he is skeptical about a woman being ruler of the Iron Islands, citing the fact that the Islands have never had a queen. He then gives his support to [[Euron Greyjoy]] and follows him when the newly-proclaimed king orders Theon and Yara's murder.{{Ref|GOT605}}
