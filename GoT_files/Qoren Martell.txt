{{Quote|The Triarchy has made common cause with Qoren Martell of Dorne.|Reggio Haratis|The Princess and the Queen}}
Prince '''Qoren Martell''' is the head of [[House Martell]] and the sovereign [[Prince of Dorne]] during the [[War for the Stepstones]] and the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[Prince of Pentos|Prince]] [[Reggio Haratis]] informs [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] and his family that Qoren Martell has allied [[Dorne]] to the [[Triarchy]], threatening the [[Stepstones]] once more.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Qoren Martell joined the [[War for the Stepstones]] in support of the Triarchy, four years after [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] and [[Corlys Velaryon|Corlys]] originally went to war with them.

Viserys considered a marriage between [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] and the Prince of Dorne in order to bring Dorne under the Iron Throne, though he eventually made her marry [[Laenor Velaryon]].

At the beginning of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], the [[Greens]] reached out to Qoren to try and forge an alliance. Qoren outright rejected [[Otto Hightower]]'s terms, replying "''Dorne [[First Dornish War|has danced with dragons before]]. I would sooner sleep with scorpion''s," and declared Dorne neutral during the civil war. Otto's failure to broker the alliance was one of several reasons why King [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] replaced him as [[Hand of the King]].
