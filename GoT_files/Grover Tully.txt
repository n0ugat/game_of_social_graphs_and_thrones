{{Quote|Lord Grover is fickle and easily swayed.|Rhaenyra Targaryen|The Black Queen}}
Lord '''Grover Tully''' was the head of [[House Tully/House of the Dragon|House Tully]], [[Lord of Riverrun]], and [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]] during the reigns of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]] and [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]].

==Biography==
===Background===
In [[112 AC]],{{Dateref|The Heirs of the Dragon}} Grover was among the lords who swore allegiance to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] as heir to the throne.{{Ref|HOTD110}} In [[132 AC]],{{Dateref|House of the Dragon: Season 2}} he is described as "fat and old"{{Ref|HOTD201}} and said to be incontinent.{{Ref|HOTD202}} [[Serena Frey]] considers him an oaf.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
The [[Small Council]] discusses a land dispute in the [[Riverlands]] between [[House Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken]]. While [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] argues that it is an issue for Lord Grover to preside on, Rhaenyra says that the [[Iron Throne]] should look into it, considering the intense rivalry between the two houses. When asked why Lord Grover didn't already address the issue himself, [[Jasper Wylde]] says he has heard that the elderly Grover has become so frail that in truth [[Grover Tully's son|Grover's son]] now rules Riverrun in all but name.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

When the [[Greens]] stage their [[coup in King's Landing]], [[Otto Hightower]] mentions [[Riverrun]] as an ally.{{Ref|HOTD109}} At the [[Black Council]], Maester [[Gerardys]] informs the council that he has sent [[raven]]s to Lord Grover to ask for his support, while [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] plans to treat with Lord Grover personally when he flies to the Riverlands.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Frustrated by Grover's reluctance to declare for the Greens, [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], during a session of the [[Green Council]], threatens to send [[Sunfyre]] and [[Vhagar]] to sway "fat old Lord Tully," proposing to fly to Riverrun.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

After rising hostilities between Houses [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken|Bracken]] result in the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]], [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] suggests sending a raven to Riverrun ordering Lord Grover to rein in his bannermen, only for [[Jasper Wylde]] to insultingly dismiss Grover's ability to control them. Following his [[Taking of Harrenhal|capture of Harrenhal]], Daemon orders [[Simon Strong]], Harrenhal's castellan, to summon Grover so he can treat with him to bring House Tully to the Blacks' cause. Simon warns Daemon Grover is a senile old man whose bannermen don't respect his authority, but Daemon insists on meeting with him.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Ser [[Oscar Tully]], Grover's grandson, is introduced to Daemon. He reports that his grandfather is incapacitated, lying in a kind of waking sleep, unable to do much more than take meager drink. Oscar is shocked by Daemon's suggestion to kill Grover, stating he loves his grandfather.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Grover dies of his illness (it is implied that [[Alys Rivers]] "helped" him die), and is succeeded by Oscar.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Grover Tully was already an old man by the [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council of 101 AC]], in which he supported Prince [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys Targaryen]] over Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]]. When [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] visited the [[Trident]] in 112 AC, a son of Lord Tully tried to court her.

When the [[Dance of the Dragons]] broke out in 129 AC, Grover wanted to support Aegon II and the Greens, but he was bedridden and too aged to act. His grandson and heir Ser Elmo, who preferred Rhaenyra's claim, kept the Tully banners at Riverrun at the beginning of the war.

Grover's death occurred in later point in the books.

Grover's name is a humorous reference to the ''Sesame Street'' character [[w:c:muppet:Grover|Grover]], and so are the names of his grandson Ser Elmo, and his great-grandsons Lord Kermit and Ser [[Oscar Tully|Oscar]] (the latter is Grover's grandson in the show). By the end of Viserys I's reign Kermit was still just a young boy "green as summer grass", and his younger brother Oscar was "still greener."

The TV series apparently condensed several of Grover's descendants together, given that Grover's son was never even named in the text - a son who apparently predeceased him, as his grandson Elmo is his heir when the civil war begins. In Season 1's "The Princess and the Queen," it is remarked that Grover's son, not his ''grandson'', now rules Riverrun in all but name. Grover's eldest (great) grandson in the TV version is also now named Oscar instead of Kermit (it's possible the TV writers chose to avoid this because "Kermit" is even more well-known as a Muppet name). It is unknown if a second grandson will be introduced in the future or by what name.
