{{Quote|Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.|[[Tyrion Lannister]] to [[Sansa Stark]]|Mhysa}}
Lord '''Desmond Crakehall''' is the Lord of Crakehall and the head of [[House Crakehall]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
As [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] walk through the [[Red Keep]]'s gardens, Lord Desmond and Ser [[Eldrick Sarsfield]] walk by, clearly laughing at Tyrion, who notes their names for future humiliation.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are several characters whose first name is (among them [[Grand Maester]] [[Desmond]], Desmond Grell, and Desmond Redwyne), but none of them are members of House Crakehall. Instead, House Crakehall is headed by Lord [[Roland Crakehall]].
