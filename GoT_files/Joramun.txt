{{Quote|Lucky for you southerners, the Free Folk rallied to a King-Beyond-the-Wall, as we will when need be.|[[Ygritte]]|The Night's Watch}}
'''Joramun'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a legendary [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]].

==Biography==
According to legend, Joramun gathered the [[Free Folk]] to battle [[Night's King]], who had made the [[Night's Watch]] into his personal army. He joined forces with the [[House Stark|Stark]] [[King in the North|King of Winter]], [[Brandon Stark (Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]] and together they [[Fall of Night's King|brought down]] Night's King.{{Ref|H&L212}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Joramun is the legendary first [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] who not only fought Night's King, but also blew the Horn of Winter to wake [[giants]] from the earth.

According to legend, the Horn is also capable of bringing the [[Wall]] down.

When [[Jon Snow]] comes to [[parley]] with Mance Rayder (actually to kill him), Mance shows him a huge horn, claiming it is the legendary Horn of Winter. He tells Jon to deliver an ultimatum to [[Castle Black]]: unless the wildlings are allowed to pass the Wall within three days, he will blow the horn and destroy the Wall. The horn is destroyed while Mance is executed. However, later Tormund tells Jon that the destroyed horn was a fake; Mance has never found the true horn. There is a theory that the [[Old warhorn|broken warhorn]] which Sam has in possession is the Horn of Winter, but it has not been verified so far.
