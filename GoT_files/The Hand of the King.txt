{{Premise|H&L707}}

==Narration==
'''Petyr Baelish''': ''"What the King dreams, the [[Hand of the King]] builds." Or so say the Kings, the Hands, and the lords who wish to be Hands.'' 

''The [[Smallfolk|lowborn]] put it differently: "The King eats, and the Hand takes the shit."''

''The fact is most Kings hate ruling. We shouldn't blame them. Their only qualification is blood. So naturally, they're wary of a seat made of blades. Far better to find other men to rule in their stead. But how should a King select his Hand?''

''Family? [[Aenys Targaryen|One King]] chose his brother, Prince [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]], a warrior who was proud and arrogant. Maegor agreed to marry the [[High Septon (Faith Militant uprising)|High Septon]]'s [[Ceryse Hightower|niece]] to unite the [[Faith of the Seven|Faith]] and the Crown, but then secretly wed a [[Alys Harroway|second wife]] in a [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] ceremony artfully combining bigamy and heresy.''

''And when word of it got out, the King was forced to exile Maegor and choose a [[Murmison|septon]] as his new Hand. But the damage had been done. The King had trusted in family, and his brother had set off a [[Faith Militant uprising|rebellion]] that would claim his rule and his life.''

''Strength? As little more than a boy, Ser [[Criston Cole]] replaced the legendary Ser [[Ryam Redwyne]] on the [[Kingsguard]] and soon rose to [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]]. But [[Knighthood|knights]] only know one way to settle disputes.''

''When Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s [[Viserys I Targaryen|father]] died, Ser Criston slit the throat of [[Lyman Beesbury|an advisor]] who objected to Aegon's ascension over his aunt, the [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|anointed heir]]. His actions so pleased the new King, Aegon, Second of His Name, that he appointed Ser Criston as his Hand in the ensuing civil war called the [[Dance of the Dragons|Dance of Dragons]]. Neither Ser Criston nor the King nor even the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[dragon]]s would survive it.''

''Perhaps it's no surprise that the [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|wisest King]] in the history of [[Westeros]] made the wisest choice for his Hand. The son of a lowly blacksmith, [[Septon]] [[Barth]], had few options for advancement in the world and even fewer after his family gave him to the Faith as a child.'' 

''But as royal record keeper, Barth impressed the King so much that the King, defying all his highborn advisors, made Septon Barth his Hand. Forty years of prosperity ensued. So much did Barth accomplish that many lords and commoners credited him with sorcery. No other explanation could they accept for a man without blood or skill at arms because what Barth had was rarer than both. A sharp mind.''

''Years later, the realm had no sharper mind than Lord [[Tywin Lannister]], Hand to King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]], or as history remembers him, "The Mad King." He saw [[assassin]]s and plots in every shadow, heard whispers in silence, and burned men alive. But his greatest madness by far was driving away Lord Tywin.''

''The Mad King then cycled through every mistake of his ancestors. [[Jon Connington|Soldiers]], [[Qarlton Chelsted|toadying]] [[Owen Merryweather|lords]] and at the end, even an [[Rossart|alchemist]], perhaps to save the crown's growing expenses on [[wildfire]]. Unfortunately, it didn't save his crown or his dynasty.''

''The new King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] chose his foster father, Lord [[Jon Arryn]], as his Hand. The wisest decision Robert ever made, not that it had many rivals. Too bad it proved so fatal.''

''Lord Arryn was a man of honor from an ancient and proud family. But honor is no shield against the corruption of [[King's Landing|the capital]], as Lord Arryn's successor, [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]], learned as well.''

''Perhaps the Hand of the King is a flawed idea. Westeros needs a ruler who can rule, who builds what he dreams himself. A King who can't govern his kingdom is no King, and a Hand who shits what another man eats is an arse.''

==Behind the scenes==
*This short contains a major mistake: '''[[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] was the ''half-sister'' of [[Aegon II Targaryen]], not his ''aunt''.''' ''[[The Dance of Dragons]]'' featurette accurately described her as his half-sister. For that matter, "[[The Dance of Dragons (episode)|The Dance of Dragons]]" from [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]] had [[Shireen Baratheon]] explain who Rhaenyra and Aegon II were, and she directly stated in dialogue that Rhaenyra was Aegon II's half-sister.
**Of course, Rhaenyra did marry her own uncle, [[Daemon Targaryen]], who was also Aegon II's uncle on their father's side - thus Rhaenyra actually was Aegon II's aunt ''by law'', in a sense. Still, both sides in the war usually referred to her as his half-sister, which is a closer relationship.
*This short continues an error introduced by the live-action TV series: when it finally depicted King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], the "Mad King", in a brief flashback montage in Season 6, it depicted him as clean-shaven...even though he is repeatedly described as having gone so crazy that he gave no thought to his physical appearance: his hair and beard where freakishly long, past his waist, and completely filthy and unkempt, in long matted ropes. For that matter, his live-action appearance also omitted that he had stopped cutting his fingernails too, until they were ''several inches'' long. Then the Season 6 ''Histories & Lore'' short on "[[The Great Tourney at Harrenhal]]" depicted the Mad King as he is described in the books, and even had the narration explicitly point it out - his long and unkempt hair, beard, and fingernails which made it obvious he was insane just from his appearance. Thus the Mad King's depiction in this animated short is even in contradiction with the other animated short.
**It even contradicts the ''Conquest & Rebellion'' chapter "[[The Last Dragons]]," which accurately shows the Mad King with a crazed, large and unkempt beard.
**Perhaps this short was simply depicting Aerys at a point before he went totally crazy and stopped cutting his hair.
*The short does, for the first time, accurately depict the four men who served as Hand of the King in rapid succession after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] abandoned the Mad King:
**[[Owen Merryweather]], a genial sycophant, exiled for failing to end Robert's Rebellion in its infancy
**[[Jon Connington]], a soldier, dismissed after he lost the [[Battle of the Bells]]
**[[Qarlton Chelsted]], another sycophant, who did find the strength to refuse to implement the [[Wildfire plot]] and burn King's Landing, for which Aerys had him burned alive
**Wisdom [[Rossart]], leader of the [[Alchemists' Guild]], who served for all of two weeks before the rebels arrived at King's Landing, and ''was'' willing to implement the wildfire plot, but was killed by [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] during the [[Sack of King's Landing]] before he could.
*When [[Criston Cole]] is shown, the short accurately depicts the [[heraldry]] of [[House Cole]], a family from the [[Stormlands]]: ten black pellets on a scarlet field (arranged in four descending rows, 4-3-2-1).
*[[Alys Harroway]] is accurately depicted wearing the heraldry of [[House Harroway]]: a bend sinister (diagonally cut in half from lower left to upper right), the upper left half black and the lower right half orange, with a castle in the middle, colors counter-charged (the opposite color on each side of the dividing line, so the top left half of the castle is black against an orange background, while the lower right half of the castle is orange against a black background. The castle sigil stands for their rule over [[Harrenhal]], the largest castle in Westeros.
*The septon mentioned as having been named as Aenys's Hand to replace Maegor was Septon [[Murmison]], a reputed miracle worker. He was named in an attempt to placate the Faith's anger over Maegor's polygamous marriage and other affronts the Faith felt House Targaryen had committed against them. Murmison's appointment, unfortunately, did little to ease tensions between the Faith and Crown, and Murmison directly made things worse when he performed the marriage ceremony between Aenys's eldest [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|son]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|daughter]]. Murmison was excommunicated from the Faith for such a blatant act of heresy; when Aenys wrote an angry letter to the High Septon in Oldtown, defending his children's marriage and demanding Murmison's reappointment, the High Septon retaliated by calling on the faithful across Westeros to overthrow Aenys. Murmison was later ambushed and murdered by a group of Faith Militant in the streets of King's Landing less than a fortnight after his excommunication. By the time of the events of ''A Song of Ice and Fire,'' Murmison is considered one of the worst Hands of the King in history for his disastrous actions; when [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] frets about his fitness to be Hand to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], believing the Hand should be a man of learning, Maester Pylos points out Murmison was one and yet utterly failed as Hand.
*Maegor's polygamous second marriage to Alys Harroway caused great strife with the [[Faith of the Seven]], but it was his half-brother King [[Aenys Targaryen]]'s later, baffling stupid decision to marry his own son and daughter to ''each other'' (the incestuous marriage of Prince [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon]] and Princess [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena]]), that specifically sparked off the [[Faith Militant uprising]]. Aenys fled the capital after a [[Faith Militant raid on the Red Keep|narrowly thwarted attempt on his life]] to Dragonstone and soon died from stress (or was poisoned by his aunt [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] according to some source), and Maegor usurped the throne ahead of Aenys's own children. The full story of this is explained in ''The Sons of the Dragon'', a prequel novella released a few weeks before this Blu-ray short in 2017. Alys was derided as Maegor's whore, and was claimed to have threesomes with Maegor and his third wife Tyanna of the Tower. Alys later gave birth to a monstrous stillbirth, however - quite probably due to poisoning by Tyanna, after which convinced Maegor that he couldn't have been the father of such a monster, and Alys was having affairs. In response, Maegor killed ''every living member of House Harroway'', rendering it extinct, and Tyanna slowly tortured Alys to death over the course of a fortnight. This dark act started the belief that Harrenhal was cursed, and any who ruled it would come to ruin. The reality is that Harrenhal is such a prize that rule over it tends to be given away as a political favor by one faction or another, meaning its rulers tended to get caught up in highly charged civil wars more than most, resulting in a high "turnover" rate among its rulers.
*The woman who officiates the marriage between Maegor and Alys Harroway is stated to have been performed in a "Valyrian ceremony" - note that the woman officiating the wedding ceremony is Maegor's own mother, [[Visenya Targaryen]]. Visenya had to perform the marriage, according to the ritual of the [[Old Gods of Valyria|Valyrian religion]], because such a polygamous marriage was considered heresy to the Faith of the Seven (along with the fact Maegor's first wife, [[Ceryse Hightower]], was the [[High Septon (Faith Militant uprising)|High Septon]]'s niece), and they couldn't find any [[septon]] willing to officiate it. The furore caused by the marriage forced Aenys to give Maegor a choice between either setting aside Alys or exile. Maegor chose exile and left for [[Pentos]] with Alys, taking [[Balerion]], [[Blackfyre]] and [[Dark Sister]] with him.
*Septon Barth isn't known to have actually "practiced" magic, as far as anyone knows, though he did read extensively on the subject from various old sources, and from his research wrote an extensive compendium on magic and [[dragon]]s, ''Unnatural History''. His work was considered the definitive writing on the subject for generations, but a hundred years later King [[Baelor I Targaryen]], a pious zealot, ordered all copies burned. Only a few scattered pages survived the flames (of which [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] has managed to find several).
