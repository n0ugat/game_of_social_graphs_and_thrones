'''Protector of the Seven Kingdoms'''{{Ref|GOT610}} is a title that combines the titles of [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms]] and [[Protector of the Realm]], the two traditional titles held by the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]]. This centralizes the power of the [[king]]s of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. The title was apparently created by [[Cersei Lannister]], which she held until her death.<ref name="E63">"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref><ref>"[[The Bells]]"</ref> [[Daenerys Targaryen]] also took on the title for herself.<ref name="E63"/>

The title was not used beyond the reigns of the two queens. Upon his [[Great Council in the Dragonpit|election]], [[Bran Stark]] took the titles "Lord of the Six Kingdoms" and "Protector of the Realm," returning to the original styling of the monarchs.<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>
