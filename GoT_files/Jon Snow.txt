{{Quote|You've got the North in you. The <u>real</u> North.|[[Tormund]]|The Last of the Starks}}
'''Jon Snow''', born '''Aegon Targaryen''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Āegon Targārien''}} is the son of [[Lyanna Stark]] and [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], the late [[Prince of Dragonstone]]. From infancy, Jon is presented as the [[bastard]] son of [[Lord of Winterfell|Lord]] [[Eddard Stark]], Lyanna's brother, and raised alongside Eddard's lawful children at [[Winterfell]]. Jon's true parentage is kept secret from everyone, including Jon himself, in order to protect him from those that sought the complete annihilation of [[House Targaryen]].

Jon joins the [[Night's Watch]] and is later elected as [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]]. As a result of several controversial decisions, such as allowing the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] to settle south of the [[Wall]], Jon is murdered in a [[Mutiny at Castle Black|mutiny]], but is resurrected by the [[red priest]]ess [[Melisandre]].

Freed from his Night's Watch vows, Jon and his half-sister [[Sansa Stark]] retake Winterfell from [[House Bolton]], restoring House Stark's dominion over the North. Jon is declared [[King in the North]].

Jon negotiates with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] for an alliance against the [[White Walkers]] in the imminent [[Great War]]. Later he pledges himself and his army to Daenerys, with whom he falls in love, subsequently abdicating his throne and being named [[Warden of the North]].<ref>[[War of the Five Kings|File:Jon_renounce.jpg]]</ref>

Later, Jon learns his true lineage from [[Samwell Tarly]], revealing Daenerys is his aunt. A dragonrider whose dragon was [[Rhaegal]], he fights in the [[Battle of Winterfell]], during which the [[Night King]] is defeated and the return of the [[Long Night]] is prevented. Afterwards, Jon aids Daenerys in her resumed campaign to take the [[Iron Throne]] and participates in the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. However, when Daenerys lays waste to a surrendered [[King's Landing]], Jon tries but is unable to dissuade her from more destruction and [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassinates]] her to prevent further carnage.

Following a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]], Jon is sent into [[exile]], returning to the Night's Watch. He leads the remaining Free Folk to settle in the thawing [[Beyond the Wall|free lands]].

==Biography==
===Background===
{{Quote|His name is Aegon Targaryen. If Robert finds out, he'll kill him. You know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me.|Lyanna Stark to her brother Ned, speaking of her son Jon Snow.|The Winds of Winter}}
[[File:Abduction of Lyanna Stark.png|thumb|Artistic depiction of Rhaegar Targaryen abducting Lyanna Stark.]]
[[File:The Winds of Winter 22.jpg|thumb|Ned Stark finds Lyanna dying after giving birth to Rhaegar's last living child, whom Ned then passes off as his own bastard son, "Jon Snow."]]
[[File:Game-of-Thrones-S6-Ep10-The-Winds-of-Winter-Baby-Jon-Snow.jpeg|thumb|Jon Snow as an infant.]]
Seventeen years before the [[War of the Five Kings]], Rhaegar Targaryen allegedly [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted Lyanna Stark]] in a scandal that led to the outbreak of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Rhaegar eventually returned to fight in the war, but not before leaving Lyanna behind at the [[Tower of Joy]], guarded by [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] [[Gerold Hightower]] and Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] of the [[Kingsguard]]. Eddard Stark rode to war along with her betrothed, [[Robert Baratheon]], to rescue his sister and avenge the [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|deaths of their father and brother]] at the orders of [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]], the Mad King.{{Ref|GOT101}}

Robert ultimately killed Rhaegar at the [[Battle of the Trident]], effectively ensuring their victory in the war. After the [[Sack of King's Landing]], Ned continued south in search of his sister and ultimately found her at the Tower of Joy in the [[Red Mountains]] at the border of Dorne. Ned and his companions engaged in a [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy|final fierce melee]] with the remaining Kingsguard, which resulted in the deaths of all combatants save Ned himself and [[Howland Reed]].{{Ref|GOT603}}

After defeating the last of the Kingsguard, Ned rushed into the tower to save his sister - only to find Lyanna dying from childbirth, having just given birth to Rhaegar's own son. Desperate to protect the life of her newborn child, a fading Lyanna pleaded with Ned to promise her that he would keep her son safe, and his true heritage hidden from Robert as he had been Rhaegar's most bitter enemy. Furthermore, the boy's existence was a potential threat to Robert's claim to the [[Iron Throne]] after the deaths of Rhaegar's other children, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon]], by his wife [[Elia Martell]], who also perished, during the Sack of King's Landing. In accordance with her last wish, Ned resolved to pass Lyanna's son off as his own bastard and raise him in his home castle - a great blow to his honor as he knew that his decision would shame both himself and his wife, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]].{{Ref|GOT610}}{{Ref|H&L207}}

Rather than using his nephew's birth name of Aegon, which would have given away his real parentage, Ned gave the baby the name "Jon" after his great friend and mentor [[Jon Arryn]], Lord of the Vale, whom he loved like a second father. The boy also grew up using the surname "Snow", as is customary for acknowledged bastards in the [[North]]. In truth, however, "Jon" is not a bastard at all, as Rhaegar apparently had his marriage to Elia annulled and married Lyanna.{{Ref|GOT705}}

Jon spent the next seventeen years being raised in Winterfell as Eddard's illegitimate son, alongside his trueborn children with his wife. Understandably, Eddard never told anyone, including Catelyn or Jon himself, who his mother was or even if she was still alive. When pressed by Robert, whom he couldn't deny an answer, Ned vaguely claimed that Jon's mother was a lowborn woman named "[[Wylla]]" that he met during the war.{{Ref|GOT102}} Eddard never treated Jon much differently from his trueborn children.{{Ref|GOT101}}

Despite sharing a happy marriage, Jon's presence at Winterfell would serve as a constant source of friction between Eddard and Catelyn. Catelyn never mistreated Jon, but she was cold towards him and avoided him whenever possible, viewing him only as a living reminder of the one time that Eddard had dishonored her.{{Ref|GOT101}} Catelyn would later confess to her daughter-in-law [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]] about how Jon caught the pox when he was a child, and she stayed with him through the night and prayed to the gods to let him live out of guilt for previously praying for his death, accepting that the boy was not to blame for her husband's sin, though it was still not enough to make her love Jon, something she would eventually come to regret.{{Ref|GOT302}}

Due to his bastard status, Jon grew up feeling like an outsider at Winterfell. Although Ned would see that he was well-treated, Jon's attendance at Winterfell's more "formal" occasions was restricted and he would even be barred from sitting inside at the Lord's table with his family so as not to offend important guests. Otherwise, Jon still lived better than many bastard-born children and was well-raised by Eddard as his own. He was loved by his father and siblings, was never hungry or poor, lived in his father's castle, and had a noble's upbringing. Jon received a highborn education from Maester [[Luwin]] and a young lord's martial training from Winterfell's [[master-at-arms]], Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]].{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Jon_and_Robb.png|thumb|Jon and Robb play with snowballs in their childhood.]]
Of the Stark children, Jon was very close friends with Robb - given that they were roughly the same age, being regular companions in training and riding. He was also close with both [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], and was friendly rival to Lord Eddard's [[ward]], [[Theon Greyjoy]]. However, Jon's closest relationship was with [[Arya Stark|Arya]], who, as an adventurous tomboy prone to un-ladylike pursuits, also felt like a social outsider.{{Ref|GOT102}} In contrast, Jon's early relationship with Sansa was unpleasant; very much her mother's daughter, she was aloof and cold to him as well.{{Ref|GOT604}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Jon and Robb instruct Bran in archery, when their father receives word about a captured [[Desertion|deserter]] from the [[Night's Watch]], for which the penalty is death. Jon accompanies his father, Robb, Bran, Theon, Rodrik, and [[Jory Cassel]], Rodrik's nephew. out to the holdfast where the deserter, [[Will]], is being held. It is Bran's first time watching his father carry out an [[execution]], but as the deserter is brought into position outside, Jon warns Bran not to look away, as their father will know. Jon praises Bran afterwards for keeping his composure. On their way back to Winterfell, they find a dead [[direwolf]] - a species not seen south of the Wall in centuries - and her newborn pups.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Screen_Shot_2013-06-16_at_12.18.27_AM.png|thumb|Jon finds Ghost, the runt of a litter of direwolves.]]
Jon talks Eddard into allowing the young Starks to adopt them, pointing out that a direwolf is the [[Heraldry|sigil]] of House Stark: given that there are five direwolves and five trueborn Stark children, it must be a sign that the Stark children are meant to have the pups. In order to make this point, Jon intentionally leaves himself out of the count of Stark children, and when Bran asks about this, Jon responds that he is not a Stark. Just as they are about to leave, however, he finds the runt of the litter, an albino, which crawled away from its mother's corpse. Theon remarks, "The runt of the litter, that one's yours, Snow." Jon takes this direwolf as his own, naming him [[Ghost]].{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Jon, Robb and Theon 1x01.png|thumb|Jon, Theon and Robb discuss the royal family.]]
Catelyn ensures that Jon, Robb, and Theon are groomed for the arrival of Robert and Queen [[Cersei Lannister]]. Jon, in particular, is set against the altering of his appearance, as well as expressing antipathy against the [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|royal family]]. When the Baratheon entourage arrives, Jon is present, but is not allowed to attend the subsequent banquet for fear of offending the royal guests (on Catelyn's suggestion). He waits outside in the courtyard venting his frustrations against a practice dummy. When Jon's uncle, [[Benjen Stark]], arrives, Jon tells him he has been thinking about it, and before his father leaves for the south he wants to join the Night's Watch.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Winter is Coming Tyrion and Jon.jpg|thumb|Jon meets Tyrion Lannister.]]
Since they don't care about recruits' pasts and even a bastard can rise to positions of high honor in it, the Watch provides an easy escape from his life in Winterfell. He later meets [[Tyrion Lannister]]. As a [[dwarf]], Tyrion knows what it is like to be an outcast, so he gives the young man some advice: never try to hide what he is, for the world will not forget. Instead, he should wear the name "bastard" openly, like armor, and then it can never be used to hurt him. When Jon angrily asks Tyrion what he knows about it, Tyrion replies that "all dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes."{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow 1x02.jpg|thumb|Jaime sarcastically thanks Jon.]]
Before departing, Jon has a run-in with [[Jaime Lannister]], who infamously killed his grandfather, the Mad King. Jaime sarcastically thanks him for protecting all of them from the mythical monsters that allegedly exist [[beyond the Wall]], in order to taunt him. Before Jon departs for the Wall, he says goodbye to the unconscious Bran, who has been injured in a fall. He gives Arya a sword named [[Needle]] that he had made especially for her, advising her to "stick them with the pointy end." Jon says he will miss her, and they both hug.{{Ref|GOT102}}

[[File:Kingsroad3.jpg|thumb|Robb bids farewell to Jon.]]
As he prepares his saddle, Robb asks if Jon said goodbye to Bran and is sure Bran will survive. Jon says Starks are hard to kill, and Robb asks about his mother, and Jon assures him she was kind. Robb offers to visit him at the Wall sometime, and they bid farewell with a hug. At their parting on the [[Kingsroad]], Eddard vows to tell Jon the truth about his mother the next time they meet. Jon is accompanied by his uncle Benjen and Tyrion, who has expressed a desire to see the Wall (and urinate from the top of it) before he dies. Ghost also accompanies Jon to the Wall.{{Ref|GOT102}}

[[File:GOT103.jpg|thumb|Jon trains at Castle Black.]]
At [[Castle Black]], Jon's expectations of the Night's Watch are soon disappointed. Instead of a brotherhood of noble warriors sworn to defend the realm from [[Free Folk|wildlings]] and [[White Walkers]], he realizes the Watch is a dumping ground for criminals and wastrels. He earns the enmity of Ser [[Alliser Thorne]], the master-at-arms in charge of training new recruits. He humiliates his fellow recruits with his superior fighting skills, learned from Winterfell's master-at-arms over the course of many years.{{Ref|GOT103}}

[[File:Jon and Benjen 1x03.png|thumb|Benjen bids farewell to Jon atop the Wall.]]
Benjen stands with Jon on his first watch and tells him that he is going ranging North of the Wall. Jon is keen to accompany him, but Benjen insists that he complete his training. Tyrion helps Jon see that he is no better than the recruits, but has been afforded more advantages than them due to his highborn upbringing. Jon offers to train some of his new brothers and [[Pypar]] and [[Grenn]] accept.{{Ref|GOT103}} He also befriends the fat and bookish coward [[Samwell Tarly]] when he arrives at [[Castle Black]], and helps to protect him from the cruelty of Thorne. Thorne angrily tells Jon that going easy on Sam won't help him, and will risk getting him killed during the next winter.{{Ref|GOT104}}

[[File:Jon 1x07.png|thumb|Jon takes his vows before the heart tree beyond the Wall.]]
After completing his training, Jon is inducted into the Night's Watch and swears his oath before a weirwood [[Heart tree]] on the north side of the Wall. He is assigned to the stewards rather than the rangers, and at first, thinks it is due to his ongoing feud with Thorne. However, Sam points out that Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] has asked for Jon as his personal steward, and may be grooming him for command. Jon is concerned when Benjen's horse returns to the Wall riderless. Later, Ghost finds the corpses of two rangers assigned to Benjen, [[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers]].{{Ref|GOT107}} Learning of Eddard's imprisonment, Thorne taunts Jon about being a traitor's bastard, causing Jon to draw a knife in anger. He is restricted to quarters.{{Ref|GOT108}}

[[File:Jon and Jeor.jpg|thumb|Lord Commander Mormont rewards Jon.]]
Later, Othor's corpse becomes a [[wight]] and attacks Mormont. Jon saves Mormont's life by burning the wight, earning a pardon for his earlier misdemeanor.{{Ref|GOT108}} Mormont also gives Jon his [[Valyrian steel]] sword, [[Longclaw]] - given that his own son [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] fled into exile and left it behind. Jon ponders abandoning the Watch to join Robb's army when it marches against the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], but [[Aemon]] tells him that he chose to stay with the Watch when he was similarly tested - as he is secretly a long-forgotten great uncle of the Mad King, and was once known as Aemon ''Targaryen'', but his entire family was killed at the end of Robert's Rebellion.{{Ref|GOT109}}

[[File:Jon and Pypar 1x10.png|thumb|Jon is convinced to return to the Night's Watch.]]
News of [[Execution of Eddard Stark|Eddard's execution]] reach Castle Black. Jon immediately leaves, meaning to join Robb and seek vengeance for his father's death. Samwell, Pypar, and Grenn intercept him and convince him to stay. Mormont tells Jon their war against the White Walkers is more important than the game of thrones in King's Landing. He tells Jon that the Watch is marching beyond the Wall in force, to find Benjen and learn the truth about the threat. Jon swears to him not to attempt to desert again and accompanies the troops as they set out.{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Mormont prepares Jon for a command role as the [[great ranging]] travels North seeking Benjen and an explanation for the wight attack. They pass through several abandoned wildling villages before arriving at the home of their unsavory ally [[Craster]].
[[File:Sam, Edd and Jon 2x01.jpg|thumb|Edd tells Jon of Craster's sexual inclinations upon their arrival at the Keep.]]
Jon is perplexed when he learns that Craster [[Incest|incestuously]] marries his own daughters, but apparently has no sons. He takes an instant dislike to Craster when they meet with him. Craster reveals to Jeor that he has not seen Benjen, and that the wildlings are gathering with their leader, [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] [[Mance Rayder]]. Jeor reprimands Jon for failing to follow his lead with Craster - the man disgusts him as well, but unfortunately, he's one of the few wildlings who is willing to give them shelter and supplies which mean the difference between life and death for many black brothers in the wild.{{Ref|GOT201}}

Sam appeals to Jon to aid Craster's pregnant daughter-wife [[Gilly]]. She is afraid of having a son, but will not say why. Jon is frustrated and refuses to disobey Jeor's order to leave Craster's wives alone. Jon sees Craster carrying a newborn into the woods and follows him. He sees Craster leave the child for a White Walker but does not recognize the creature hidden in the shadows. Craster spots him and knocks him out.{{Ref|GOT202}} Craster disarms Jon and drags him back to his keep. He expels the rangers from his home. Jeor reveals that he knew that Craster was sacrificing his sons, but chose to ignore it because of his usefulness as an ally of the Night's Watch.{{Ref|GOT203}}

[[File:Arriving at the fist of the first men.jpg|thumb|Jon arrives at the Fist of the First Men.]]The rangers reach the ancient fortified peak known as the [[Fist of the First Men]] and await [[Qhorin]] and his party from the [[Shadow Tower]]. When Qhorin arrives, he suggests altering their tactics and using small groups to overcome Mance's lookouts in the [[Skirling Pass]]. Jon asks to join Qhorin's raiders and Jeor lets him go.{{Ref|GOT205}}

[[File:Jon lies with Ygritte 2x6.png|thumb|Jon and Ygritte share body heat.]]
Qhorin leads his men into the pass, and they locate and ambush the wildling watchers. Jon realizes his opponent is a young woman and hesitates to kill her. She introduces herself as [[Ygritte]], but does not give away details of Mance's plans. Qhorin leaves Jon alone to execute Ygritte. Jon is unable to do it and she escapes. He pursues and recaptures her, but they become separated from Qhorin's group. Jon decides they cannot regroup with Qhorin due to the approaching night. Ygritte convinces Jon to sleep next to her to share body heat and keep warm, and then makes sexual advances towards him. Jon rejects the temptation to break his oath.{{Ref|GOT206}}

[[File:Jon and Ygritte.jpg|thumb|Jon and Ygritte discuss the restrictions of the Night's Watch vows, including his virginity.]]
Jon unties Ygritte's legs, while keeping her hands bound, as he continues his search for the rest of the raiders. She tells him that she knows that he is a virgin. As they walk, Ygritte questions Jon as to why the men of the Night's Watch hate the wildlings. She explains that both the Free Folk and the [[Northmen]] like the Starks are descendants of the [[First Men]], and the wildlings just happened to be on the wrong side of the Wall when it was built. She urges him to forget about his oath and live free. Another sexual advance from Ygritte prompts him to reach for his sword. She backs away and trips him with the rope, when he is caught off guard.{{Ref|GOT207}}

[[File:Halfhand and Jon Snow.jpg|thumb|Qhorin and Jon are held captive by the wildlings.]]
He pursues her but is ambushed and taken captive. Ygritte tells him that he should have taken her when he had the chance.{{Ref|GOT207}} Ygritte brings Jon to the [[Lord of Bones]], and convinces him that Mance will want to question Jon. The Lord of Bones has a prisoner of his own; Qhorin. The Halfhand tells Jon that the rest of the men were killed while they searched for him. He urges Jon to make their deaths meaningful and become a spy within the wildling ranks. He then feigns anger with Jon until he is restrained after managing to knock Jon over.{{Ref|GOT208}}

In Winterfell, after Theon betrays House Stark and [[Capture of Winterfell|takes the castle]], he refuses to flee and join the Night's Watch when he is surrounded by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]]'s men, claiming that Jon will likely kill him for betraying the Starks and apparently burning Bran and Rickon alive (in actuality, Theon faked their deaths).{{Ref|GOT210}}

[[File:Jon kills Qhorin.jpg|thumb|Jon slays Qhorin.]]As they make their way to Mance, Ygritte continues to playfully mock Jon by tapping him on the head with the flat of Longclaw. Qhorin uses the distraction to advance his plan to portray Jon as a traitor to the Night's Watch. He attacks Jon, and the Lord of Bones allows them to fight. Jon is initially reluctant until Qhorin calls [[Eddard Stark|his "father"]] a traitor and his mother a whore. Jon slays Qhorin, who whispers a line from the Night's Watch oath to Jon with his dying breath, stunning Ygritte and the rest of the band. Jon's hands are freed, and Ygritte leads him to the crest of the mountain to look over the massive wildling encampment.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
As Jon is led by Ygritte and the Lord of Bones into the main wildling camp in the [[Frostfangs|Frostfang mountains]], he discovers that almost all of wildling society is on the move to escape the White Walkers, including the women and children. As they enter the camp, Jon is shocked to see a real-life [[Giants|giant]] walk past. Many of the wildlings are surprised to see Jon in his all-black Night's Watch clothing and shout "crow!" at his approach. Several young boys pelt Jon with ice and small stones but Ygritte shoos them away.{{Ref|GOT301}}

Jon is led into the tent of the King-Beyond-the-Wall, Mance Rayder, where the Lord of Bones explains that he is Ned Stark's bastard son to a large man with a heavy beard who is eating chicken by the fire. He says he doesn't care, but his interest is piqued on hearing that Jon killed Qhorin Halfhand. As they talk Jon kneels before the man, whom he assumes to be Mance Rayder, and calls him "your Grace." This causes all of the wildlings to burst out laughing. As it turns out this isn't Mance, but his lieutenant [[Tormund |Tormund Giantsbane]]. The real Mance is an unassuming man sitting in a corner, who then introduces himself and tells Jon to stand, as no man kneels before another among the Free Folk, since they do not recognize a class of nobility in their culture.{{Ref|GOT301}}

Mance says he is glad that Jon killed Qhorin, as he had killed many of Mance's wildlings. Mance asks Jon why he wants to join them and he replies he wants to be free, but Mance doesn't believe this. Jon then explains that when the Night's Watch camped at Craster's Keep, he saw Craster leave his newborn son in the woods as an offering, and the inhuman creature that took it. Jon says that he wants to leave the Night's Watch, because he is disgusted that Mormont already knew what Craster was doing but did nothing to stop it. Jon states that the First Men he is descended from defeated the White Walkers once during the [[Long Night]], and that now he wants "to fight for the side who fights for the living." Mance is satisfied and advises Jon to get a new cloak, his black one clearly attracting malignity.{{Ref|GOT301}}

[[File:Got-game-of-thrones-34037192-953-536.jpg|thumb|Mance explains his unification process to Jon.]]
Jon then marches south with the Free Folk army. Mance explains that his army is a diverse force, formed of about ninety different groups or clans of wildlings, who speak seven different languages, and have numerous internal rivalries. However, he managed to unite them all by telling them the truth: that they will all die if they remain north of the Wall. Mance brings Jon to one of his scouts, [[Orell]]. He is sitting silently with his eyes rolled back as an eagle circles above him. Mance says that he is a "[[warg]]."{{Ref|GOT302}}

Jon learns a warg is a person who is capable of entering the mind of an animal, seeing what it sees and even controlling its actions. Orell controls his eagle to scout miles ahead. Mance asks him what he has seen, and Orell says he saw the Fist of the First Men - and many dead "crows."{{Ref|GOT302}}

As Jon and the Free Folk arrive at the Fist of the First Men, they survey the bloody aftermath of the assault on the Night's Watch by the White Walkers and their army of undead wights. However, they only find corpses of horses and no human remains. Jon says that there were three hundred men of the Night's Watch at the Fist, and asks Mance if Mormont could still be alive. Mance says that with Mormont, it's possible he was able to escape, but that even if he did he and his men took quite a beating and are trapped miles away from the Wall with the White Walkers in close pursuit. Mance warns Jon that all of the missing corpses from the Fist are no longer his friends and brothers from the Night's Watch, but have been resurrected as undead monsters who serve the White Walkers. Jon reluctantly agrees.{{Ref|GOT303}}

Mance orders Tormund to take a force of twenty men to scale the Wall to attack Castle Black from its exposed rear. Mance's plan is for Tormund's small band to distract Castle Black by attacking their exposed southern side, at which point Mance's main army will assault it from the north. Tormund will know that Mance is in position when his army makes a massive signal fire. Mance orders Tormund to take Jon with him, as Jon knows the layout of Castle Black, and it will prove a key test of his loyalty: if it turns out that he won't really betray the Night's Watch, Tormund can easily throw him off the Wall to his death.{{Ref|GOT303}}

On their way to the Wall and Castle Black, Jon and Ygritte are gathering firewood, when the warg Orell asks him about the defenses of the Night's Watch. Orell has seen through the eyes of his eagle that there are patrols on top of the Wall and he wants to know how frequent they are. Jon says they usually sent out patrols in teams of four, two builders to inspect for structural damage and two rangers to protect them, but that the frequency of their patrols often changes. Orell says the wildlings know there are nineteen castles along the south side of the Wall, but he wants to know how many are currently manned.{{Ref|GOT305}}

Jon finds this very unpleasant, but reluctantly says that only three are currently manned. Apart from Castle Black, there is also [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] at the extreme eastern end, and the Shadow Tower at the western end. Jon is then asked how many men currently garrison Castle Black. Jon is very reluctant to answer, but after being threatened by Orell, he gives an exaggerated number, saying there are one thousand men (this is a lie, as Castle Black only had six hundred men before the great ranging, and the garrison now is closer to three hundred). Tormund tells Jon that he likes him, but if he is lying to them, he will rip his guts out through his throat. Despite this, Jon remains steadfast to the lie.{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[File:Kissed-by-fire-jon-and-ygritte.png|thumb|Jon loses his virginity to Ygritte.]]
Jon and Ygritte then walk away, but she steals his sword Longclaw, making him chase her to get it back. She leads him into a nearby cave. Ygritte starts disrobing, and says that she wants to make sure Jon has truly come over to the wildlings' side and broken his Night's Watch vows - by making him break his oath of celibacy with her. She quickly shucks off all of her clothes and walks up to him naked. Jon is very hesitant at first, but they soon end up having sex in the cave. Afterwards, Jon and Ygritte lay together in a naked embrace, and Ygritte tells Jon she wishes they could stay in this cave forever.{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[File:Jon and Ygritte kissing.jpg|thumb|Jon and Ygritte kiss atop the Wall.]]
He joins a wildling party led by Tormund Giantsbane to climb the Wall. Beforehand, he is questioned by Ygritte about their relationship and his allegiance to the Night's Watch, saying that he must be loyal to her instead. During the climb, Ygritte causes part of the ice to break, leaving them hanging in the air by the rope. Orell, believing them to be lost, cuts it. Jon manages to save himself and Ygritte by climbing back to the ice. The two return to the climb and reach the top, where Ygritte gazes at the north side and the south side, before they kiss.{{Ref|GOT306}}

[[File:Ygritte_and_Jon_Bear_and_Maiden_Fair.jpg|thumb|Jon and Ygritte journey south of the Wall.]]
After surviving the perilous climb of the Wall, Jon, Ygritte and the wildlings led by Tormund Giantsbane advance through the [[Gift]] - the strip of land immediately south of the Wall which the Watch draws supplies from - and continue on towards Castle Black, to await Mance Rayder's signal to begin the attack. Afterwards, Jon confronts Orell about cutting his and Ygritte's rope loose on the Wall, nearly killing both of them in the process. Orell tells Jon that he doesn't see Ygritte complaining about what happened, because she is a wildling and understood what needed to be done in a pressure situation, also telling Jon that this is the reason he will never be able to keep her.{{Ref|GOT307}}

During the journey through the woods, a jealous Orell confronts Ygritte and says that he would be a better man for her than Jon, while continuing to express his distrust in him. Later, Jon tries to persuade Ygritte that the wildlings can't win an attack against the realms but she refuses to listen and points out that Jon is now one of them; if it fails, so does he. She restates her passion for him and tells him bluntly that if they die, they die, but before they die, they will live.{{Ref|GOT307}}

[[File:Ygritte and Jon - The Rains of Castamere.png|thumb|Jon and Ygritte argue over the killing of innocents.]]
Jon and the wildling party prepare to raid an elderly horse breeder's home for his horses and gold; Jon insists that the old man is no threat to them, but Orell and Tormund Giantsbane intend to kill the man so as to stop him from alerting the Night's Watch to their presence. However, when the party attacks the farmstead, Jon surreptitiously hits a rock with his sword, alerting the old man who flees; Jon also distracts Ygritte when she tries to shoot the fleeing man with an arrow. Outside, Tormund moves to kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man, and instead, Ygritte kills the man with an arrow.{{Ref|GOT309}}

[[File:Rain of castamere jon snow.png|thumb|Jon battles Orell.]]
Realizing that Jon is still loyal to the Night's Watch, Tormund orders his men to kill Jon; Tormund restrains Ygritte to stop her trying to help Jon, and soon after Jon battles with Orell. In the nearby [[Queenscrown]], a hidden Bran enters the mind of [[Summer]] to aid Jon. as he battles to the death with Orell and finally kills him. With the last of his strength Orell wargs into the mind of his pet eagle, which swoops down and attacks Jon, clawing him badly about the face before he fights the bird off. Jon then steals a horse and escapes, leaving a heartbroken Ygritte and heading back to the Wall.{{Ref|GOT309}}

Stopping to rest and tend to his injury, Jon is confronted by a furious Ygritte, who has an arrow ready to shoot him. Jon tries to talk Ygritte out of shooting him, insisting that he still loves her. Though his feelings are clearly reciprocated Ygritte is still angered by his betrayal and shoots Jon three times with her bow as he flees from her. Jon is badly injured, but his horse manages to carry him the rest of the way to Castle Black, as he hovers in and out of consciousness. Having reached safety, Jon is brought inside the castle by the guards, where he encounters Sam and Pypar, who are overjoyed to see him and insist that his injuries be taken care of.{{Ref|GOT310}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Jon survives the injuries inflicted by Ygritte and has largely recovered, though he still grimaces while getting dressed. At some point, Jon has been told about his half-brother Robb's death at the [[Red Wedding]] and wanting vengeance for his family, but decides to stay at the wall. He shares with Sam that he had always been jealous of Robb for having more of their father's affection and for being better than him at riding, fighting, and winning the affection of other girls. Still, he says he could never bring himself to hate Robb, as he was also always a good friend and honorable person. Sam responds by saying he has felt the same way about Jon, that Jon is better than him at everything (except reading).{{Ref|GOT401}}

[[File:S04E1_-_Jon_Snow.png|thumb|Jon testifies before a panel of sworn brothers.]]
It turns out that Sam had been sent to retrieve Jon, who has been summoned to testify before a panel of five sworn brothers, including Maester Aemon, acting Lord Commander Alliser Thorne, and [[Janos Slynt]] (who was exiled to the Wall by Tyrion). At the hearing, Jon admits to killing Qhorin, living amongst the wildlings, and sleeping with one. He also states that Mance intends to attack and gives intel on his plans and strength. Both Slynt and Thorne are openly hostile to Jon, disbelieving much of what he says and call for his execution. Aemon, however, realizes that Jon is speaking the truth, and the hearing ends with Jon being allowed to keep his head.{{Ref|GOT401}}

Meanwhile, at the [[Dreadfort]], when Theon is pressed by [[Roose Bolton]] for information on the whereabouts of Bran and Rickon, he reluctantly guesses that they may try to head to Jon at Castle Black. At Ramsay's suggestion, Jon becomes a target of the Boltons, since Ramsay reasons that even though Jon may be a bastard, he is still a son of Ned Stark, and may pose a threat to the Boltons' future hold on the North, either because the Northerners who are still furious at the Boltons for betraying the Starks may rally behind him even though he is a bastard in the Night's Watch, or because Jon may simply seek revenge on both Roose and Ramsay for their role in the Starks' downfall at Red Wedding. Roose subsequently sends his hunter, [[Locke]], to the Wall in order to infiltrate the Watch, use Jon to find Bran and Rickon and then kill them all, promising a lordship as a reward.{{Ref|GOT402}}

[[File:Jon_speaks.png|thumb|Jon speaks to the Night's Watch about the wildling threat following the raids in the Gift.]]
The orphan [[Olly]] then arrives at Castle Black, telling them how the wildling raiding parties south of the Wall killed his entire village. Thorne asks for Jon's opinion on protecting the smallfolk living in the Gift, thinking Jon will disagree with his decision not to send help. Instead, Jon regretfully says that he knows from his time with the wildlings that this exactly what they want - to lure as many of them out of Castle Black as possible to weaken its defenses for the massive attack about to come from the north side of the Wall, which would allow them to move over a thousand miles southward before they reached an army that could stop them.{{Ref|GOT403}}

Therefore, Jon agrees with Thorne that they should do nothing, and concentrate every available man in Castle Black itself to brace for the assault. They are interrupted by a single horn blast, revealed to be Grenn and Edd, who have escaped the [[mutineers]] at Craster's Keep. Jon is relieved to see them alive, but his relief turns to concern when they reveal that the mutineers remain entrenched at the keep. Jon understands that if the mutineers are captured by Mance Rayder, then the wildlings will know how vulnerable Castle Black really is. Jon tries to convince Thorne that eliminating the mutineers should be their top priority.{{Ref|GOT403}}

[[File:Grenn and Jon - Oathkeeper.png|thumb|Jon and Grenn train the new recruits in preparation for the impending battle against the wildlings.]]
Jon and Grenn are training the new recruits, one of which is Locke, to fight wildlings. The training session is interrupted by Thorne who continues to talk down to Jon and reminds him that he is a steward. Locke approaches Jon and they get acquainted, with Jon unaware of Locke's true purpose. Jon and Sam are talking about Bran going beyond the Wall. Jon is worried for Bran and once he realizes that he could be at Craster's Keep, Locke comes in to tell him that Thorne has summoned him. Thorne gives him permission to attack Craster's Keep, but only with volunteers; Slynt convinced Thorne that Jon questioning his decisions is a problem, and if Jon gets himself killed on a dangerous mission he ''volunteered'' for (knowing the risks), it will both remove him and be his own fault; alternatively, if he succeeds and returns alive, so much the better.{{Ref|GOT404}}

Jon gives a speech about avenging Mormont's death at the hands of the mutineers and this convinces a number of his brothers to join him in his attack, including Grenn, Edd, and Locke (who secretly intends to kill Jon during the mission and blame it on the mutineers).{{Ref|GOT404}}

[[File:Karl's death.png|thumb|Jon kills Karl with Longclaw.]]
The group [[Raid on Craster's Keep|attacks]] at night, taking the mutineers by surprise. Jon personally enters the main building to deal with [[Karl Tanner]]. The two of them are evenly matched, though Karl manages to get the upper hand by spitting in Jon's face and then kicking him to the floor. Before he can land the finishing blow, Karl is stabbed in the back by [[Sissy]]. Karl attempts to kill her, though it's a fatal mistake as Jon doesn't miss the opportunity to thrust Longclaw through the back of Karl's head and out of his mouth.{{Ref|GOT405}}

[[File:S04E5_-_Jon_Snow_&_Ghost.png|thumb|Jon reunites with Ghost.]]
After the fight, Jon and the others count five dead amongst the Watch, including Locke, whose neck was snapped in a way that terrifies Jon (Jon being completely unaware that Locke had been killed by a Bran-possessed [[Hodor]]). He then reunites with Ghost, before turning to Craster's wives and offering them refuge at Castle Black. They decline, saying that after the abuse they took at other members of the Night's Watch they can't trust them and will go their own way. Before leaving, they set a torch to Craster's Keep, burning it to the ground.{{Ref|GOT405}}

[[File:S04E7 - Jon & Grenn.png|thumb|Jon returns to Castle Black.]]
Jon and his fellow black brothers return to Castle Black, much to the annoyance of Thorne and Slynt. Once Alliser spots Ghost, he orders Jon to lock up Ghost or his direwolf will become food for the Night's Watch. Later, Jon reports that Mance Rayder's army was closing in on Craster's Keep and will reach the Wall before the next full moon. Jon states that defending the tunnel is hopeless since the gates will not stop the giants in Mance Rayder's army. He proposes they seal the tunnel, but Alliser Thorne refuses to listen. Alliser then assigns Jon and Sam to night duties atop the Wall until the next new moon.{{Ref|GOT407}}

[[File:S04E8_-_Jon_&_Sam.png|thumb|Jon and Sam receive the recent news regarding Mole's Town.]]
News of the wildling [[Sack of Mole's Town|attack on Mole's Town]], the largest village in the Gift, reaches Castle Black. Jon, Pypar, and Eddison Tollett try to comfort a distraught Sam, who believes that Gilly and her baby are dead. Grenn is furious that the wildlings slaughtered the inhabitants of [[Mole's Town]], which included brothers of the Night's Watch. Jon concludes that if Mole's Town has been attacked, then Mance Rayder's assault on Castle Black is imminent.{{Ref|GOT408}}

Atop the Wall, Jon and Sam are staring out into the darkness of the north and awaiting the imminent wildling invasion. Sam attempts to interrogate Jon about what it was like to be with a woman, stating that as their deaths are likely imminent, it may be his last chance to find out. Sam brings up that the vows of the Night's Watch only explicitly forbid members from taking wives or producing children, and that other "activities" are open to interpretation. Jon replies glumly that Alliser most likely does not care about their interpretations. When further pressed by Sam to describe lying down with Ygritte, Jon attempts to explain but is unable to properly express it, proclaiming exasperatedly that he is "not a bleeding poet." Jon offers to take the watch up alone so Sam can go below.{{Ref|GOT409}}

[[File:S04E09_-_Jon_(On_the_Wall).png|thumb|Jon spots Mance's promised signal.]]
Later that night, Jon hears the horn blowing and looks north, witnessing a tremendous conflagration north of the Wall, just as Mance had promised him. Jon approaches Thorne, who finally relents and admits that they should have heeded his advice and sealed the tunnel, but grimly muses that leadership means not second-guessing oneself because of "clever little twats" like him. While they start to prepare for the massive wildling army that is emerging from the woods, another horn blows from down below at Castle Black, signaling the unanticipated appearance of Tormund's band of wildlings at Castle Black.{{Ref|GOT409}}

[[File:S04E09 - Jon & Grenn (On the Wall).png|thumb|Jon silently thanks Grenn.]]
Alliser decides to go down and defend the keep, leaving Slynt in charge of the Wall's defenses. Even though a wildling strike force led by two giants, [[Mag Mar Tun Doh Weg|one of which]] is riding a [[mammoth]], charge towards Castle Black's outer gate, Slynt does nothing and breaks down, demoralizing the troops. Grenn steps in by falsely claiming that Alliser needs Janos back down in Castle Black, allowing Jon to take command of the Wall's defenses, silently thanking Grenn. The black brothers continue to rain down arrows on the advancing wildlings, even killing ones that are attempting to scale the Wall.{{Ref|GOT409}}

[[File:Season-4-Episode-9-The-Watchers-on-the-Wall-game-of-thrones-37169832-2100-1397.jpg|thumb|Jon takes command on the northern defense.]]
[[Dongo]], armed with a massive bow, manages to fire a huge arrow at one of the bunkers atop the Wall, and Jon is unable to warn his brothers fast enough before the giant fires again, violently killing one of his black brothers. Although Jon manages to repel most of the wildlings attacking the outer gate, including the mammoth, one giant manages to single-handedly lift the gate. Jon, knowing the inner gate won't hold against him, sends a group of black brothers led by Grenn to hold it at any cost. Jon decides to give Edd control of the top of the Wall, and tasks Sam with releasing Ghost from his pen to assist in the fighting, then orders half a dozen other men to descend with him and finally enter the fray.{{Ref|GOT409}}

[[File:Battle_of_Castle_Black.jpg|thumb|Jon fights Styr during the battle for the Wall.]]
Jon quickly dispatches many wildlings with Longclaw, catching the attention of [[Styr]], Magnar of the [[Thenns]], and so the two meet in single combat. Styr eventually gets the upper hand by knocking Longclaw away, then Jon disarms Styr of his axe using some chains, and the fighting goes hand to hand. Styr brutally smashes his face into an anvil and tosses him into the blacksmith's forge. However, when Styr picks Jon up and begins to strangle him, Jon spits blood in Styr's face, distracting him long enough for him to grab the blacksmith's hammer lying next to him and bury it into Styr's skull.{{Ref|GOT409}}

[[File:Ygritte_dies.png|thumb|Ygritte dies in Jon's arms.]]
Upon killing him, Jon turns around to find Ygritte pointing her bow at him with an arrow drawn. He smiles at her, causing her to hesitate. Before either can say anything, Ygritte is shot through the heart by Olly. Jon holds her in his arms as she tells him that they should have never left the cave, and they lament circumstances that prevented them from being together as she succumbs to her wound.{{Ref|GOT409}}

Later, while Edd forces the wildling army to retreat for the night, down below Jon deals with a heavily wounded Tormund, who continues to fight despite being the only wildling left alive in the castle. Jon subdues him with a crossbow and orders his brothers to take him prisoner and interrogate him. The following morning, Jon discusses with Sam his suicidal solution to end the wildling threat: he plans to assassinate Mance Rayder, noting that he is the only thing binding the disparate wildling clans that make up the army, and his death will rob them of that purpose and leadership.{{Ref|GOT409}}

[[File:Jon_goes_beyond_the_Wall.png|thumb|Jon ventures beyond the Wall to confront Mance.]]
Sam tries to stop him, but to no avail. As Jon prepares to leave via Castle Black's tunnel, they discover the bodies of the black brothers who held the inner gate against the giant. Grenn is amongst the casualties, and Jon tells Sam that all bodies must be burned. Before Jon leaves, he remembers the promise he made to Jeor Mormont and decides to leave Longclaw with Sam. Sam tells Jon to come back, and Jon looks and Sam and gives him an unsure smile before stepping out into the wilderness on the other side of the gate.{{Ref|GOT409}} Jon finds Mance in a wildling camp north of the Wall, and claims he wants to negotiate with him.{{Ref|GOT410}}

[[File:S04E10 - Jon & Stannis.jpg|thumb|Jon meets Stannis Baratheon.]]
Despite Mance expressing disappointment at Jon's betrayal, they drink a toast to some of their fallen friends, such as Grenn, Ygritte, and Mag the giant. Mance then notices that Jon is eyeing a cooking knife, and quickly deduces that Jon came to [[parley]] with Mance simply so he could assassinate him. Before anyone can make a move, they are interrupted by the sound of war horns. Outside, hundreds of mounted knights led by [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Davos Seaworth]] arrives and slaughter many of the wildlings, scattering the rest.{{Ref|GOT410}}

[[File:S04E10_-_Burial_of_Ygritte.png|thumb|Jon gives Ygritte a northern burial beyond the Wall, at the request of Tormund.]]
Jon introduces himself to Stannis as Ned Stark's son, and suggests that Stannis arrest Mance instead of executing him, reasoning that Mance had the chance to kill him, but chose not to. Out of respect for Ned, Stannis accepts, and Jon also advises Stannis to burn the bodies of the dead in order to prevent them from returning as wights. During the funeral, Jon notices [[Melisandre]] staring at him through the flames. Later, Jon visits Tormund, who tells Jon that Ygritte truly loved him, and asks him to lay Ygritte to rest north of the Wall. Jon later takes his love's body into the woods and burns it, weeping as he walks away.{{Ref|GOT410}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[File:Stannis on the wall.jpg|thumb|Jon bows before Stannis.]]
Jon spars with Olly, along with other new recruits before being summoned by Melisandre to see Stannis atop the Wall. He questions the Red Woman if she is cold, as she is dressed in unusually light clothing for the local climate, but she states that "the [[Lord of Light|Lord]]'s fire" lives within her. Melisandre asks if Jon is a virgin. Jon replies he is not, which she approves. Jon meets with Stannis and Davos, kneeling before the king. With Roose Bolton ruling Winterfell, Stannis asks Jon if he wants to avenge his fallen [[Robb Stark|half-brother]].{{Ref|GOT501}}

Jon reaffirms that he is a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. Davos states that his loyalty to the Watch is considered dubious because of his time spent with the wildlings. Nevertheless, Stannis wants Jon to retake the [[North]] with the help of the wildlings, stating that he will pardon them and declare them citizens of the realm once the war is won. Stannis will give the wildlings their lives and freedom if Mance bends the knee and swears his loyalty. He gives Jon until nightfall to convince Mance, or the King-Beyond-the-Wall will be burned as a sacrifice to the [[Lord of Light]].{{Ref|GOT501}}

[[File:Jon_and_Mance_wars_to_come.jpg|thumb|Jon attempts to convince Mance to bend the knee to Stannis.]]
Jon does his best to convince Mance to save his life as well as all the wildlings, but fails: the wildlings only follow him because he kneels to no one, so if he did kneel to Stannis, they would lose all respect for him and ignore his commands anyway, so he might as well die with his honor intact by refusing. As Mance is led to the pyre, Stannis gives him one last chance to save his life. Mance politely refuses and is led to the stake and Melisandre lights the pyre. Unable to watch Mance suffer, Jon storms off. Just as the fire begins to fully consume Mance, he is mercifully shot through the heart with an arrow by Jon.{{Ref|GOT501}}

Stannis and Davos summon Jon to discuss his future. Stannis shows him a letter delivered by messenger-[[raven]] from [[Lyanna Mormont]] saying she would only pledge her House to a member of House Stark. Stannis offers a simple solution: as king, he will officially legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell. Later that day, the [[Elections#Night's Watch|choosing]] for the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch has begun, and many brothers of the Night's Watch have assembled to vote for either Thorne (who is fervently supported by Janos) or Ser [[Denys Mallister]] commander of the Shadow Tower.{{Ref|GOT502}}

[[File:LCJonSnow.png|thumb|Jon is elected the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, fulfilling Jeor's wish.]]
After hearing from Jon that he intends to refuse Stannis's offer and stay true to his vows, Sam nominates Jon as the third candidate and recounts how he took command of the defense of Castle Black (including the fact that Thorne fought bravely and Slynt was cowering in the pantry with Gilly) and was willing to sacrifice himself to stop Mance. With the votes cast, Aemon and his aide tally the tokens and a tie is declared between Jon and Thorne. Aemon feels around in his hands for his voting chip and produces a circle token and adds it to Jon's stack amidst cheers and laughter, as Jon has been chosen as the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.{{Ref|GOT502}}

Jon is approached by Stannis and Davos about the offer of legitimization. As the new Lord Commander, Jon reminds the king that his place is with the Night's Watch, even though his dream was to be a Stark. Stannis, a man of duty, respects his decision to keep his vow and tells Jon he intends to march on Winterfell within a fortnight since the Night's Watch cannot afford to feed both his army and the wildling prisoners. He also recommends sending Thorne to command Eastwatch-by-the-Sea], and that executing the wildling prisoners would be the safest choice. Stannis then leaves, but Davos stays behind and tries to further persuade Jon to help Stannis retake the North. Davos iterates that the Night's Watch is "the shield that guards the realms of men", telling Jon that it may not just mean protecting the Seven Kingdoms from beyond the Wall, but possibly taking part in battles in order to prevent the Seven Kingdoms from suffering, such as the North will under Bolton rule.{{Ref|GOT503}}

[[File:JonSnowS5E3.jpg|thumb|Lord Commander Jon Snow presides over a mess hall meeting.]]
During Jon's first general meeting of the garrison in the main hall as Lord Commander, he starts with some levity by assigning a black brother to oversee the digging of a new latrine pit. He also acknowledges Ser Alliser Thorne as an experienced and valuable member of the Night's Watch by naming him [[First Ranger]]. Jon then orders Slynt to man and repair [[Greyguard]], a ruined castle. Janos refuses to obey and Jon reminds him that this is a direct order. Janos then refuses him a third time and Jon asks Janos if he's refusing to obey the order. Janos publicly insults him, telling Jon, "You can stick your order up your bastard ass." Jon orders Janos to be taken outside, and calls for Olly to fetch him Longclaw, while Janos insists Jon is mistaken if he thinks he can frighten him.{{Ref|GOT503}}

[[File:Small justice for Ned.png|thumb|Jon executes Janos Slynt.]]
Obedience to the laws of his "father" - that the man who passes the sentence must swing the sword - Jon makes ready to personally behead Janos. While on the chopping block, Janos begins to plead for mercy. After a moment of hesitation, Jon executes the cowardly former Commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] with a single blow. From across the courtyard, Stannis sees Jon behead Janos for refusing his orders, and slightly nods in approval.{{Ref|GOT503}}

Jon continues to train new recruits, with Stannis, [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse]], [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]], and Melisandre observing him, with Stannis implying that he does not believe Jon to be Eddard's bastard son - saying that Eddard was always an honorable man and it wasn't in his character to randomly have sex with some tavern whore. Later, Sam presents him with requests to the Northern Lords for men for the Night's Watch.{{Ref|GOT504}}

[[File:Melisandre and jon sons of the harpy.jpg|thumb|Melisandre attempts to seduce Jon.]]
He is reluctant to send one to Roose Bolton, [[Robb Stark|his brother]]'s killer, until Sam convinces him that they must stay neutral and ask for as many men as they can for the Watch, and right now the Boltons rule the North and have the most men - leading Jon to sign the request angrily. Melisandre enters his office and again tries to persuade him to chase [[Roose Bolton|the]] [[Ramsay Bolton|rats]] out of his home, but he claims that Castle Black is now his home. She attempts to seduce him, sensing a power inside his blood, but Jon rebuffs her, remembering his love for Ygritte. As Melisandre leaves, she tells him, "You know nothing, Jon Snow."{{Ref|GOT504}}

Later on, Jon consults Aemon for advice on a hard decision he is about to make, noting that half the men in the Night's Watch despise him for his sympathy for the wildlings, but Aemon tells him to "Kill the boy, and let the man be born," in other words, just make the hard choice and do what he believes is best. Indeed, Jon's plan is to allow the wildlings to pass the Wall and settle in the North as subjects of the Seven Kingdoms or even let them join the Watch. Jon's idea is met with harsh criticism, even from his closest friends such as Edd and Olly, but Jon's goal is actually to keep the wildlings from falling into the hands of the coming White Walker army. Jon points out that every single wildling left on the north side of the Wall will be killed, then resurrected and added to the White Walkers ever-growing army of the undead.{{Ref|GOT505}}

[[File:Kill the Boy promo.jpg|thumb|Jon watches as Stannis leaves Castle Black.]]
Jon speaks alone with Tormund, who reveals that the remainder of Mance's army probably fled back to [[Hardhome]], a large fishing village on the coast. Jon requests that Tormund go there and negotiate with the remaining wildling chieftains, to let them pass through the Wall on Jon's terms. Tormund agrees, so long as Jon accompanies him so that the wildlings will know it is not a trap. Jon borrows several of Stannis's ships for the journey (as he is marching inland and won't be using them). Later, as Stannis prepares to leave Castle Black for Winterfell with his army, Jon thanks him for his help, promises him he will have his ships back, and watches Stannis depart for Winterfell to take his childhood home back from the Boltons.{{Ref|GOT505}}

Jon later prepares to leave Castle Black with Tormund and a group of black brothers including Edd. He entrusts the care of the Night's Watch to Thorne, who criticizes his mission, and says his farewells to Sam, who gives him a bag of [[dragonglass]] daggers in case he should run into White Walkers on the way. He hugs Sam for what might be the last time and leaves Castle Black on his mission.{{Ref|GOT507}}

Later at Winterfell, Ramsay mentions to Sansa that Jon has been made the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, citing Jon as an example of a bastard who rose high in the world, claiming that if Jon did it, then so can he.{{Ref|GOT507}}

[[File:Hardhome-boat.jpg|thumb|Jon arrives at Hardhome, eager to evacuate the wildlings.]]
Jon reaches Hardhome with his companions. After Tormund kills the Lord of Bones for challenging him, he and Jon go inside a hut to speak with the leaders of the clans. Though the wildlings are prepared to kill Jon for murdering Mance, Tormund stands up for him and reveals that Jon killed Mance out of mercy. Jon offers to share the dragonglass weapons with the wildlings and allow them to settle on land south of the Wall if they promise to aid the Night's Watch in the coming battle against the White Walkers: even if they and all the men of the Seven Kingdoms are not enough to stop them, they can at least die fighting. Five thousand wildlings agree while the rest decide to stay, though Tormund hopes more will come around with time.{{Ref|GOT508}}

[[File:JonSnowHardhome.jpg|thumb|Jon uses Longclaw to defeat a White Walker.]]
However, as they are preparing to leave, they are all attacked by an army of wights. Jon fights his way to the hut to retrieve the dragonglass daggers, but he is ambushed by a White Walker. They fight for a while and Jon is almost killed until he retrieves Longclaw. To the surprise of both Jon and the White Walker, Longclaw doesn't shatter from the cold of the Walker's weapon when he uses it to parry his attack - because it is made of [[Valyrian steel]], forged with [[Dragon|dragon-fire]] and spells. Jon quickly regains his ground and slashes the White Walker with it, making it shatter into a cloud of ice particles, and revealing that the White Walkers can also be killed by Valyrian steel.{{Ref|GOT508}}

[[File:Hardhome-0.jpg|thumb|Jon gazes upon the horrific aftermath of the Hardhome massacre.]]
Edd helps Jon to his feet and they make it back to the boats to Stannis's ships, with the wights refusing to follow them in the water. But as they leave, the [[Night King]] himself appears at thousands of e wharf and shares a long glance with Jon, at the same time using his magic to raise all of the dead as wights before Jon's eyes. Jon looks on in obvious terror, as he knows the slaughter he just witnessed is merely a prelude to what is coming for all of Westeros.{{Ref|GOT508}}

[[File:Jon and Samwell The Dance of Dragons.jpg|thumb|Sam and Jon watch as the wildlings exodus.]]
Jon and the others make it back to the north side of Castle Black on foot, and he makes himself seen by Thorne so that they will be let inside. Thorne hesitates but ultimately relents and orders the gates to be opened. As the wildlings are let through Castle Black into the Seven Kingdoms, Jon laments not being able to save the rest, while Sam comforts him, reminding him that he at least saved a few, who would have died too if he did nothing. Thorne, however, warns Jon, telling him that his kind heart will get him killed. Indeed, as Jon looks around, he sees almost all of his brothers looking at him scornfully, among them Olly, [[Othell Yarwyck]], and [[Bowen Marsh]].{{Ref|GOT509}}

[[File:Mother’s Mercy 04.jpg|thumb|Jon agrees to send Sam to Oldtown.]]
Jon discusses with Sam the war against the White Walkers, and his increasingly strained relationship with the rest of the Night's Watch. Sam asks for leave to take Gilly and her baby with him to [[Oldtown]], where he will train to become a maester. Sam reasons that he is better suited to the life of a maester than a warrior, and that the Night's Watch needs to fill the gap left by the late Aemon Targaryen. Jon is reluctant, as he has few friends nowadays, and also points out that as a maester, Sam's vow of chastity will be doubly prevalent, before finding out that Sam and Gilly have had sex already (to Jon's amusement). Jon eventually agrees to Sam's request and sees him off.{{Ref|GOT510}}

Davos returns to Castle Black to beg Jon for soldiers - though this was really just a ruse to get Davos out of Stannis's camp, because he had become so desperate that he gave in to Melisandre's request to burn Shireen as a sacrifice.
[[File:Davos and Jon hear about the deaths of Stannis and Shireen.jpg|thumb|Jon and Davos are heartbroken with the deaths of Shireen.]]
Jon points out that the Night's Watch, even if they do ally with Stannis, will not be enough, and the wildlings will not fight for Stannis as it isn't their fight. Their argument is broken up by the arrival of a wearied and addled Melisandre - who abandoned Stannis when it became apparent he would lose the [[battle in the ice]]. When Davos questions her about Stannis and Shireen, she says nothing yet her sorrow is manifest, all but confirming the demise of his king and princess. Still forlorn and at a loss for words, Melisandre heads inside the castle, leaving both Jon and Davos horrified at the news.{{Ref|GOT510}}

[[File:Jon's_death.jpg|thumb|After being stabbed by his own men, Jon dies.]]
That night while reading messages, Olly comes to Jon and tells him one of the wildlings knows of the whereabouts of his uncle Benjen, who has been missing since before the great ranging. Jon quickly follows Thorne to a gathering of his Watch brothers, only to find a sign marked "Traitor." Thorne, Yarwyck, Marsh and two other black brothers [[Mutiny at Castle Black|proceed to stab]] Jon while uttering, "For the Watch." As the wounded Jon kneels, gasping for breath, Olly tearfully comes forward and after a few moments of pause, stabs Jon in the heart and declares, "For the Watch." Jon collapses and dies from his wounds before the mutineers leave him out in the cold to bleed out.{{Ref|GOT510}}

[[File:The Red Woman 17.jpg|thumb|Edd mourns over Jon's corpse, realizing that Thorne was the orchestrator of Jon's demise.]]
Upon seeing the body of his dead master, Ghost howls in mourning from his pen. His cries summon Davos, Edd and a handful of other black brothers who quickly move Jon's body to his quarters. They quickly realize that Thorne was most likely the orchestrator of Jon's demise, and free Ghost to help them protect Jon's body while Edd leaves to find Tormund and the Wildlings. Melisandre also looks at Jon's body and claims that she had seen a vision of him fighting at Winterfell, though Davos remains adamant that Jon is gone for good. Thorne later approaches Davos and the loyal brothers with a promise of amnesty if they throw their weapons down and surrender, though they refuse to back down, despite Thorne's threats of death if they don't.{{Ref|GOT601}}

[[File:Jon_Snow_Alive.jpg|thumb|Jon awakens after being resurrected by Melisandre.]]After being rescued by Edd and the wildlings, Davos goes to Melisandre and asks if there's any magic she knows of that can resurrect Jon. Shaken by Stannis's death, she says all she believed in was a lie. Davos states that he wasn't asking the Lord of Light for help, but Melisandre herself. Melisandre then performs a ritual with Jon's body: cleaning his wounds, cutting some of his hair, trimming his beard, and burning it in the fire, all while chanting in [[High Valyrian]]. Her attempts seem to be in vain. Tormund storms out in frustration, those remaining leave the room one by one, and after a few moments alone with Ghost, Jon awakens, gasping for air.{{Ref|GOT602}}

[[File:Oathbreaker 18.jpg|thumb|Jon is questioned on the afterlife.]]
Coming back to his senses, Jon is accosted by Davos and Melisandre. He reflects on his perceived failure in spite of doing the right thing, but after some encouragement from Davos, Jon gets dressed and enters the courtyard to the surprise of everyone present, reuniting with Tormund and Edd. Later, the leaders of the mutiny are rounded up for execution. After hearing last words from each (with the exception of Olly), Jon once again acts in accordance with his father's law that "the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword" and personally cuts the trapdoor rope, hanging them simultaneously.{{Ref|GOT603}}

[[File:Screen_Shot_2016-05-09_at_5.42.20_PM.png|thumb|Jon relinquishes his command to Edd.]]
Technically free from his vows, Jon then passes his cloak and command to Edd, declaring his intent to leave the Night's Watch.{{Ref|GOT603}}

[[File:Book_of_the_Stranger_36.jpg|thumb|Jon reunites with Sansa.]]
A day later, Jon packs his belongings. Edd chastises him for abandoning the Night's Watch despite the threat of the White Walkers looming, and reminds Jon of the oath he swore. Jon retorts by saying that he already died, and that he couldn't stay after what was done to him. His half-sister, Sansa arrives after escaping Ramsay with help from Theon, along with [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Podrick Payne]]. Jon is initially stunned when he sees Sansa but they tearfully embrace. Shortly thereafter, Jon and Sansa talk inside while Sansa eats. The two share their lives since leaving Winterfell, and reminisce about their childhoods. Sansa regretfully mentions how awful she was to Jon during their youth, and that she felt guilty about it for years. Jon shrugs it off as childhood mischief, though he forgives Sansa after she presses the issue. The pair acknowledge that their last haven is Winterfell, and even then, the Boltons are currently occupying it, but Jon is reluctant to fight again after everything he's been through.{{Ref|GOT604}}

[[File:Book of the Stranger 35.jpg|thumb|Jon receives a threatening letter from Ramsay Bolton.]]
Later, as Jon eats with Sansa, Brienne, Podrick, Tormund, and Edd, he receives a [[Bastard Letter|letter from Ramsay]], informing him that he is holding Rickon prisoner and furiously demanding the return of Sansa on threat of massacring Jon's allies, raping Sansa and murdering Rickon and Jon. Jon notes Ramsay's signature and Sansa deduces that Roose Bolton is dead. Jon asks Tormund how many men he has; Tormund says 2,000, not enough to fight Ramsay's 5,000 by themselves. With some urging from Sansa to rally the Northern Houses still loyal to the Starks, Jon resolves to take Ramsay down.{{Ref|GOT604}}

[[File:The Door 34.jpg|thumb|Jon plans his strategy against Ramsay.]]
While discussing strategy with Davos, Melisandre, Sansa, Brienne, Edd, and Tormund, Jon bitterly notes that they simply don't have the numbers to challenge the Boltons at present. Even though the three most powerful houses are already backing the Boltons, Jon suggests rallying the weaker houses, as their combined strength would give them a numerical advantage when combined with his current forces. When Sansa mentions [[Brynden Tully]]'s recapture of Riverrun and the virtual guarantee of support from the Tullys, Jon is surprised that Sansa has such valuable information. Thereafter, Jon, Sansa, Tormund and Brienne leave Castle Black.{{Ref|GOT605}}

With help from Tormund, Jon speaks with the wildlings and asks for their help in the coming battle against Ramsay. Though Tormund stands by Jon, Dalba is skeptical, citing that they were allowed into the North to help fight against the White Walkers, not the Boltons. Jon agrees this isn't their fight and he shouldn't be asking for their help but points out that if Ramsay wins, he will wipe them all out anyway. Tormund speaks up for Jon, saying he died for the wildlings' well-being and if they don't help him, they are "cowards." The wildlings agree after Wun Wun stands up and says "Snow", confirming his allegiance. Jon, Sansa, and Davos later appeal to Lyanna Mormont, who previously refused to aid Stannis. Jon tells Lyanna of his friendship and service under her uncle, Jeor Mormont, while he was in the Night's Watch, though Lyanna initially refuses them, citing that Jon is a bastard and Sansa has been married into House Lannister and House Bolton. Jon reveals that Ramsay is holding Rickon hostage, and Davos manages to convince her that they need to defeat Ramsay in order to unite the North against the coming White Walkers. Lyanna agrees and supplies them with sixty-two men, the remaining force of House Mormont, promising that each will fight with the worth of ten men.{{Ref|GOT607}}

[[File:607 Jon Robett Promo.jpg|thumb|Jon fails to recruit Robett.]]
However, Jon fails to convince [[Robett Glover]] to pledge his allegiance to them, as he cites Robb's failures to protect the North from the [[Ironborn]] and Jon's allegiance with the wildlings. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Jon remains adamant that they attack Winterfell before Ramsay gathers more men or the weather turns against them. Behind Jon's back, however, Sansa sends a letter calling for help.{{Ref|GOT607}}

[[File:Battle of the Bastards 03.jpg|thumb|Jon and Sansa attend a swift consultation with Ramsay.]]
Ramsay, [[Smalljon Umber]], and [[Harald Karstark]] meet with Jon, Sansa, Tormund, Davos, and Lyanna at the battlefield the day before the battle. Jon offers Ramsay a chance to settle their dispute in one on one combat but Ramsay refuses, citing his almost certain victory due to his significantly larger army. Ramsay offers surrender terms saying he will pardon Jon for breaking his Night's Watch vows if he will hand Sansa over, which is ignored. Sansa asks for proof of Rickon's capture, which he provides by way of the decapitated head of his direwolf, Shaggydog. Sansa refuses the terms of surrender, and tells Ramsay he will die the following day before riding off.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Battle of the Bastards 16.jpg|thumb|Sansa criticizes Jon's underestimation of Ramsay.]]
Jon holds a meeting with Tormund and Davos, in which he discusses their battle plan to let the Boltons attack the middle of their formation in order to encircle their army. After the meeting, Sansa criticizes Jon for not listening to her advice and for attacking too early, insisting they need more men. Jon responds that this is the largest army they could possibly gather. Jon meets with Melisandre and insists to her not to bring him back if he should fall in the battle. Melisandre insists it's not her gift that has brought Jon back but the Lord of Light's and that only the Lord of Light can decide Jon's fate.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Battle of the Bastards 46.jpg|thumb|Jon attempts to save Rickon.]]
The armies gather the following morning as Ramsay brings out Rickon. Telling Rickon that they are playing a game, he tells Rickon to run towards Jon and as Rickon does so, Ramsay brings out a bow. Jon desperately rides out on a horse to try to save Rickon, as Ramsay fires arrows at him. Ramsay appears to have no intention of hitting Rickon with his few shots but eventually, just as Jon is about to reach his brother, Rickon is struck in the back with an arrow and killed.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Battle_of_the_bastards_Jon_main.jpg|thumb|Jon Snow fights against the Bolton army.]]
With Jon now defenseless in the middle of the battlefield and charging the Bolton cavalry alone, Bolton archers fire volleys of arrows in his direction. Davos commands the Stark cavalry to follow their commander and they begin their charge to meet the Bolton cavalry, narrowly saving Jon from being trampled and forcing them to abandon their initial strategy of luring the Bolton army into encirclement. After luring Jon's army forwards, Ramsay executes his own pincer movement with his infantry, completely encircling the Stark/Wildling army. The Bolton army continues to press their advantage, with interlocking spears from all directions forcing Jon's army closer and closer together.{{Ref|GOT609}}

Jon nearly suffocates as he is pushed beneath the tide of wildlings that are pushed into one another, but he eventually claws his way out, just in time to see [[Petyr Baelish]] and Sansa arrive with reinforcements courtesy of House Arryn. The Knights of the Vale quickly flank the encircling Bolton army, which is decimated. Jon makes eye contact with Ramsay as he retreats from the battlefield and chases him. Ramsay returns to Winterfell and closes the gates, confident that their opponent is not equipped for a siege of Winterfell, as long as they remain within the gates, and he readies his archers.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Battle of the Bastards 39.jpg|thumb|A bloodied Jon confronts Ramsay.]]
However, unexpectedly, with the help of Wun Wun, Jon's forces manage to breach the gates, and the remaining Bolton forces are defeated, although Wun Wun is severely injured by a barrage of arrows and spears, and eventually succumbs to Ramsay's final arrow, as Jon and Tormund watch on in horror, helpless to save their friend. Ramsay finally accepts Jon's offer to a one-on-one duel, while wielding a bow and arrow. Grabbing a nearby shield, Jon deftly blocks all of Ramsay's shots with it until he gets close enough to smack the bow out of Ramsay's hands and hit him to the ground, whereupon he furiously punches Ramsay's face into a bloody pulp.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Battle of the Bastards 41.jpg|thumb|Jon orders Rickon's burial.]]
Though it seems as if Jon will kill Ramsay, he stops when he sees Sansa, knowing she has as much right to revenge as he does. Jon orders Ramsay locked up and the remaining Boltons surrender, restoring House Stark's hold on Winterfell. Rickon's body is found and Jon orders his body buried in the crypt with Ned's bones. Sansa asks Jon for Ramsay's whereabouts, and he directs her to the kennels, where she kills Ramsay that night by setting his own [[Bastard's girls|hounds]] on him.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:The Winds of Winter 20.jpg|thumb|Jon banishes Melisandre.]]
In the aftermath, in the Great Hall with Melisandre, Jon recalls how his family sat at the main table during feasts while he was mostly made to sit away at another table, though they both agree that Jon was luckier than most bastard children. Davos then enters and openly accuses Melisandre of sacrificing Shireen, which Melisandre admits, though also pointing out that her magic still brought Jon back to life. Shocked at the revelation, Jon orders Melisandre to leave the North on threat of execution.{{Ref|GOT610}}

[[File:Winds of winter jon snow.jpg|thumb|Jon and Sansa discuss the arrival of winter.]]
As Jon watches Melisandre riding away from the top of the castle's walls, he tells Sansa that the lord's chambers are being prepared for her and when Sansa tries to say Jon should have them, Jon responds he's not "a Stark" and that Sansa is the Lady of Winterfell. Jon continues that the battle was won because she brought the Knights of the Vale. Sansa apologizes for not telling him about the Vale army and when Jon asks her about Littlefinger, Sansa says he is not trustworthy. Jon responds he and Sansa must trust each other completely now and kisses her on the forehead. Sansa informs him that a ''white'' messenger-raven has just arrived from the [[Citadel]], officially announcing that the years-long autumn is over, and winter has come. Jon wryly points out that their father always promised it would come some day.{{Ref|GOT610}}

[[File:The Winds of Winter 11.jpg|thumb|Jon intently listens to Lyanna's rhetoric.]]
Some time later, the surviving heads of all the Northern vassal Houses convene in Winterfell's great hall, along with the lords of the Vale who came to their rescue with their large army (such as [[Yohn Royce]] and Littlefinger). They debate what to do next. Lyanna Mormont rises and shames those who did not join Jon and Sansa to help defeat Ramsay. She reiterates that the North knows no king but the [[King in the North]], whose name is "Stark." Lyanna continues by saying that ''Jon'' may be a bastard but she doesn't care and he is a Stark to her. She hails Jon as the new King in the North. [[Wyman Manderly]], whose son [[Wendel Manderly|Wendel]] was killed at the Red Wedding, also rises to apologize, saying he didn't send aid before because he didn't want to send his men to die for nothing, but now Jon has avenged the Red Wedding.{{Ref|GOT610}}

[[File:Jon Snow is declared King in The North Season 6 Episode 10 Preview..jpg|thumb|Jon Snow is hailed as the new King in the North, the White Wolf.]]
Lord Wyman goes on to call Jon "the White Wolf" and he too proclaims him King. Robett Glover apologizes profusely, saying that he dishonored himself by not aiding him before, and he only didn't help Jon because he thought he had no hope of winning. Lord [[Cley Cerwyn|Cerwyn]], whose parents were flayed alive by Ramsay and did not help out of fear, also swears his allegiance. All of the gathered lords of the North and the Vale draw and raise their swords and hail Jon as the new King in the North, echoing how Robb's bannermen previously proclaimed him king. Surprised, Jon shares a look with Sansa, who returns Jon's smile as he stands. However, Sansa's smile vanishes when she sees Littlefinger glowering in the corner of the hall.{{Ref|GOT610}}

Meanwhile, beyond the Wall, Bran experiences a vision about Jon's origins and realizes he is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.{{Ref|GOT610}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[File:GOT Season 7 05.jpg|thumb|Jon at a meeting at Winterfell.]]
To prepare for the forthcoming conflict with the Night King, the newly declared King Jon orders his bannermen to conscript all able-bodied men and boys aged 10 to 60 for combat training. However, he notes that having only half of the population in the North fighting the White Walkers is not enough he also orders that every woman and girl should also be trained and equipped as well. He also asks that all maesters should start searching for dragonglass. He stresses that dragonglass is now more valuable than gold due to the threat of the White Walkers.{{Ref|GOT701}}

When Sansa advocates that the Umbers and Karstarks be stripped of their lands and titles as punishment for supporting Ramsay, Jon advocates forgiveness and insists that children will not be punished for the crimes of their fathers. Despite Sansa's continued insistence, Jon insists his decision is final and summons [[Ned Umber]] and [[Alys Karstark]] to reaffirm their loyalty to House Stark. They oblige and kneel before King Jon. Jon says that the mistakes of the past don't matter anymore.{{Ref|GOT701}}

In private, Jon chides Sansa for questioning his decision-making in front of the other lords and ladies and tells her to trust him. When Sansa reminds him that the late Joffrey did not tolerate dissent, Jon asks Sansa if she thinks he's like Joffrey. Sansa tells Jon that she knows he is nothing like Joffrey and assures Jon that he is good at leadership but she stresses that he must act wiser than Ned and Robb.{{Ref|GOT701}}

At Winterfell, Jon, Sansa, and Davos discuss Tyrion's letter that they have received. While Sansa suspects it might be a trap, Jon doesn't think so due to Tyrion ending the letter with the line "''all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers' eyes''", which Tyrion has told Jon in their first meeting years ago. Even so, Jon agrees that now is not the right time to go to Dragonstone. Davos opines that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] will make a good ally in the war to come against the [[White Walkers]].{{Ref|GOT702}}

Later Jon receives a raven from Sam informing him of his discovery of dragonglass on Dragonstone. At another gathering of the Northern lords, Jon informs them of Sam's discovery and Daenerys's invitation telling them that he has decided to accept. Many of the Lords, including Sansa, openly disapprove, but Jon stresses that they need both the dragonglass and powerful allies like Daenerys to have any chance at defeating the Night King. He names Sansa as Regent to rule in his place until he returns.{{Ref|GOT702}}

[[File:Jon Petyr Winterfell Crypt.jpg|thumb|Jon sees through Petyr's manipulation.]]
In the crypts beneath Winterfell, Jon pays respects to Ned until he is interrupted by Littlefinger. Littlefinger tries to sweet-talk Jon, but he sees through his manipulation and starts to walk away. Littlefinger informs Jon of his love for Sansa, which causes him to lose his temper and start to strangle him. Jon threatens Littlefinger saying that he will kill him if he ever touches his sister. He then leaves the crypt and gives a farewell nod to Sansa, before joining Davos on the ride to White Harbor, where they will take a ship to Dragonstone.{{Ref|GOT702}}

[[File:Jon and Davos on Dragonstone.jpg|thumb|Jon and Davos arrive on Dragonstone.]]
Jon and Davos arrive at [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], and are immediately greeted by Tyrion and [[Missandei]]. Upon meeting, Tyrion address Jon as the bastard of Winterfell while Jon addressed him as the "dwarf" of [[Casterly Rock]]. Jon observes that Tyrion has picked up some scars. Jon also introduces Davos while Tyrion introduces Missandei, who requests that they surrender their weapons. Jon and his entourage hand over their weapons to Daenerys's [[Dothraki]] guards.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[file:Walk to Dragonstone TQJ.jpg|thumb|Davos and Jon first lay eyes on Queen Daenerys Targaryen's dragons.]]
On the walk to the [[Dragonstone|castle]], Missandei walks with Davos and tells him that she comes from the island of [[Naath]]. Davos remarks that it was a paradise full of palm trees. Jon and Tyrion talk about Sansa's marriage to Tyrion. Tyrion assures Jon that it was a sham and remarks that she is a lot smarter than she lets on, which Jon agrees. While Jon is aware of the fate of the previous Starks who had met with the Mad King, Jon insists that he is not a Stark. Jon and Davos are startled at the sight of [[Drogon]], [[Rhaegal]] and [[Viserion]] flying low over the causeway and dive to the ground, while an amused Missandei and Tyrion retain their composure. Offering Jon a hand up, Tyrion says he wishes he could tell Jon he'll get used to the dragons – but no one is quite used to them except their mother, who is waiting for Jon within.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:Jon StarkSnow.jpg|thumb|Jon clasps eyes on the Dragon Queen.]]
In the throne room, Missandei introduces Daenerys's many titles while Davos introduces Jon simply as King in the North. Daenerys thanks Jon for traveling so far but insists that he is a mere Lord. Davos begs to differ but Daenerys responds that there has been no King in the North ever since [[Torrhen Stark]] bent the knee to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], and adds that an oath lasts for perpetuity. Daenerys then reiterates her demand for Jon to bend the knee but he refuses. When Daenerys accuses him of breaking faith with [[House Targaryen]], Jon reminds her that the Mad King burnt his grandfather and uncle.{{Ref|GOT703}}

Daenerys apologizes for her father's actions and stresses that children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents. She then urges Jon to renew the historic allegiance between their two great houses. Jon expresses agreement with Daenerys's view that children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents, but argues that he is not beholden to his ancestors' oaths. Jon tells her that he has come for her help. Daenerys reminds him that she has three dragons and Dothraki who have pledged themselves to her. Getting to the point of his trip, Jon likens the fighting between the Great Houses to children squabbling over a game. Jon points out that the Army of the Dead is their true enemy. Daenerys is skeptical but Tyrion vouches for Jon. Jon says that they need to make cause to fight against the Army of the Dead.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:Jon meets Dany Queens Justice s7.jpg|thumb|Daenerys explains her faith in herself to Jon.]]
Daenerys asks Jon if his father knew that his friend Robert had sent assassins to kill her as a baby; overlooking the fact that Eddard had opposed Robert Baratheon's assassination plot and Robert had rescinded said plot on his deathbed (though, she may be unaware of that). Daenerys recounts that she was targeted by assassins, enslaved, raped, and defiled but that her faith in herself rather the gods kept her going. Daenerys talks about the miracle of her dragons' hatching and the Dothraki crossing the [[Narrow Sea]]. When Daenerys reiterates that she is destined to rule the Seven Kingdoms, Jon retorts that she will be ruling over a graveyard.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:703 Daenerys Davos Jon.jpg|thumb|Jon and Daenerys discuss his kingship.]]
Tyrion says they cannot split their forces. Davos then speaks up for his king and tells Daenerys that Jon won the support of the wildlings and fought the White Walkers. Davos also mentions that Jon came back from the dead. Davos says that it doesn't matter who bends the knee. Tyrion doesn't see the point of Jon's refusal to submit. When Jon disputes Daenerys's claims to queenship, Daenerys responds that he is in open rebellion since he has declared himself King in the North. Daenerys then receives a message from [[Varys]]. Daenerys orders Missandei to give Jon and his men food and lodging. When Jon asks if he is a prisoner, she says not yet.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:Jon TQJ.jpg|thumb|Jon examines Dragonstone.]]
Later, Jon and Tyrion discuss his predicament. Jon is unhappy his ship was taken away and is trapped on Dragonstone while the White Walkers and the Night King still pose a threat. Tyrion says he trusts the word of Jeor Mormont and Jon. Jon asks Tyrion how he can convince people about the existence of things which they don't believe exist. Jon wants to help his people and is frustrated with the deadlock. Tyrion encourages Jon not to give up. When Jon remarks that he is a fool for going south, Tyrion reassures him that the Mad King's daughter is not her father and has protected people from "monsters," telling him to speak with her servants. Tyrion asks if there is something he can do to help Jon.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:Jon_and_Dany_TQJ.jpg|thumb|Dany allows Jon to mine for the Dragonglass.]]
While Daenerys is watching over her dragons, she is joined by Jon. Daenerys tells Jon that she named her dragons Rhaegal and Viserion after her brothers Rhaegar and [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]], noting Jon's own losses and Jon nods. When Daenerys says people thought dragons were gone forever and perhaps they should be re-thinking what they believe they know, Jon realizes that Tyrion has been talking with her too. Daenerys tells Jon she is determined to remove Cersei. She allows Jon to mine the dragonglass and will provide what he needs for this. When Jon asks if she believes in the Night King and White Walkers, she only responds, "You better get to work, Jon Snow."{{Ref|GOT703}} Later, Jon leads Daenerys on a tour of the long-abandoned Valyrian dragonglass mine that Samwell Tarly told him about. The mine is ancient and impressive, used by the First Men long before the Valyrians came to Dragonstone. But this is not why Jon asked Daenerys to come.{{Ref|GOT704}}

As they proceed deeper into the mines led by torchlight, Jon shows her cave paintings they discovered left behind by the Children of the Forest, filled with arcane magical symbols. Daenerys is stunned that the mythical Children stood where they are standing now, thousands upon thousands of years ago, long before mankind ever arrived in Westeros. Jon says this isn't exactly true, leading her into another chamber, this one filled with narrative drawings of the Children and the First Men. Daenerys wonders if the Children and First Men fought each other, but Jon then shows her ancient carvings of the White Walkers themselves, one of which Jon recognizes as an image of the Night King. Jon explains that the Children of the Forest and the First Men only managed to drive off the White Walkers the first time during the Long Night because they chose to join together to fight off their own extinction, and that is the choice he and Daenerys have now.{{Ref|GOT704}}

Jon still wants Daenerys to ally with him to defeat the army of the dead, but Daenerys still wants him to bend the knee. He insists that the North won't accept a southern ruler again after everything they've gone through. Daenerys urges that they will if their king does, and asks Jon if their survival isn't more important than his pride. When Daenerys receives word about Casterly Rock and Highgarden, she becomes frustrated about her constant defeat and wants to attack the Red Keep with her dragons immediately. Tyrion advises against this, and Daenerys asks Jon for his thoughts. Jon tells Daenerys that he never thought that it was possible for dragons to live again, and that people follow Daenerys because she has done the impossible. He then warns her that if she uses her dragons to melt castles and burn cities, she will be just the same as those before her. Afterwards, Jon reunited with Theon who has survived his encounter with [[Euron Greyjoy]]. The anxious Theon asks Jon if Sansa is all right. Jon proceeds to scold Theon that what he did for Sansa was the only reason why he is still alive.{{Ref|GOT704}}

Some time later, Jon witnesses Daenerys returning to Dragonstone on Drogon. Drogon approaches Jon who does not flinch at the dragon and starts to pet him, much to Daenerys’s amazement. While they talk about leadership styles, they are approached by Jorah Mormont who has returned from Oldtown, who Daenerys tearfully reunites with. Jon then receives a letter regarding the army of the dead approaching Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. Tyrion proposes a plan to capture a wight to prove Cersei about the existence of the White Walkers. Jon agrees and departs with Davos, Jorah, and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]].{{Ref|GOT705}}

Jon arrives at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea and heads out with a ranging party consisting of Tormund, Jorah Mormont, Gendry, [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], [[Thoros]], [[Beric Dondarrion]], and a few others on a [[Wight hunt|mission]] to capture a wight.{{Ref|GOT705}} They succeed but half of the party, including Thoros, end up being killed as they are attacked by wights, prompting Daenerys to intervene with all three of her dragons and leading to the death of Viserion by the Night King, who later resurrects the beast for his own use. Despite this devastating loss, Jon continues to fight and nearly drowns in the cold waters beneath the ice. Though he manages to pull himself out, he is all alone and nearly overwhelmed by the wights until a last-minute intervention by his long-lost uncle Benjen, who tells him to flee on his horse while he buys time for his nephew to escape. While riding away on horseback, Jon watches his uncle being overwhelmed by the undead. He makes it back to Eastwatch and is brought aboard the ship with Daenerys, Davos, and Sandor.{{Ref|GOT706}}

In the Narrow Sea, Jon wakes to find Daenerys sitting at his bedside. Jon apologizes for the disastrous ranging party and the fact it caused Viserion's death, but Daenerys tells him not to apologize because she now knows that the Army of the Dead is real. Overcome with emotion, she tells Jon that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, and vows that she and Jon will together destroy the Night King. Jon thanks Daenerys, addressing her as "Dany", and Daenerys realizes that the last person to address her by that name was her older brother (and Jon's uncle) Viserys, who Daenerys remembers as not being a good person. Jon apologizes and asks if "my Queen" would be more appropriate, agreeing to bend the knee. Daenerys asks Jon what the Northern lords loyal to him will make of this. Jon assures her they will come to see her for the good person she is, as he already has. Daenerys is touched by his statement and they take each other's hand for a moment. They gaze into each other's eyes, before Daenerys suddenly pulls away and tells him to get some rest and leaves him alone.{{Ref|GOT706}}

After recovering from his ordeal, Jon and the rest of his allies head to the [[Dragonpit]] to [[Dragonpit Summit|parley]] with the Lannisters. When Cersei dismisses their warnings about the Night King and his army as a ploy to trick her into lowering her defenses, they rattle the [[captured wight]] into lunging for her, making her and her allies see once and for all that the threat from beyond the Wall is real. Jon steps forward and picks up the wight's discarded hand, using a torch provided by Davos to demonstrate how fire can be used to stop them. He then uses a dragonglass dagger to the heart to end the wight's upper half, bluntly stating that if they don't win the coming war, such a fate awaits every person in Westeros. Seemingly convinced, Cersei immediately offers terms: satisfied that Daenerys is concerned with the Army of the Dead, Cersei will not withdraw her troops, but will guarantee that they will not hinder the Targaryen or Northern forces in any way during the battle against the White Walkers. She refuses to deal with Daenerys at all, however, and calls on Jon, as King in the North and Ned Stark's son, to keep the truce and to stay out of any future conflict between Cersei and Daenerys. Jon, however, says that he cannot serve two queens - and reveals to all assembled that he has already declared for Daenerys, infuriating all three Lannisters present. Declaring that there will be no truce if it is just her and Daenerys, Cersei storms out, content to let the Starks and Targaryens battle the undead alone and then deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict.{{Ref|GOT707}}

Daenerys and Tyrion rip into Jon over his ill-advised action. Tyrion suggests that learning to lie just a little might be a good skill. Jon responds by arguing that while such an attitude may or may not have contributed to getting his father killed, if no one is willing to speak the truth, then everyone's word is worthless, and lies will not help them win the coming fight. While Tyrion goes to talk to Cersei, Daenerys and Jon discuss the dragons and how her ancestors caged them, and in turn, her family become less impressive as the power of the dragons waned, that they became like everyone else. Jon responds that Daenerys is not like everyone else. When Daenerys confides she was made infertile by [[Mirri Maz Duur]], Jon questions this, particularly when she admits it was Mirri Maz Duur who told her she was infertile. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of all three Lannisters. Cersei has agreed to work with Daenerys, but not by keeping her troops back: the Lannister army will march north to fight alongside the Starks and Targaryens. Little do Jon and Daenerys know that Cersei has no intention of keeping her promise, and that she intends to let them fight the White Walkers on their own and mop up whoever wins with the help of the [[Golden Company]]. Jaime refuses to back down from his pledge to help fight the White Walkers and defies his sister-lover by traveling north. Whether he will warn Jon and Daenerys of Cersei's plan remains to be seen.{{Ref|GOT707}}

Later, as the two of them ride a ship to White Harbor, Jon enters Daenerys's cabin where the two of them begin to consummate their relationship, still unaware that they are aunt and nephew.{{Ref|GOT707}}

Meanwhile, back at Winterfell, Sam and Gilly arrive. The former visits Bran and the two of them discuss Jon's origin: he was born to Rhaegar and Lyanna at a Tower in Dorne, and is not a Snow at all, but a Sand. Sam realizes that that isn't true either, recalling the entry from High Septon Maynard's private journal about annulling Rhaegar's marriage. Bran expressed his doubts, but Sam reiterates the private nature of the journal and encourages Bran to use Greensight to confirm it. To his own surprise, Bran easily finds the wedding, where he sees a clearly happy Lyanna wedding Rhaegar in a Faith of the Seven ceremony before a Heart tree. Seeing forward to the Tower of Joy, Bran finally hears Lyanna's dying words. Now piecing the truth together, Bran declares that Rhaegar never raped Lyanna. She loved him and ran off with him, and bore him a son, Aegon Targaryen, making "Jon" not only legitimate but the rightful heir to the Iron Throne.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:Dany Jon March to Winterfell Ep.jpg|thumb|Jon returns to Winterfell with the Targaryen forces.]]
Upon arrival in the North, Jon and Daenerys, along with their combined forces, march through [[Winter town]] on their way to Winterfell. The townspeople cast Daenerys many suspicious looks, and Jon reminds her that Northerners have a long-established distrust of outsiders. Upon arriving at Winterfell, he introduces her to Sansa. Jon and Daenerys later ride Daenerys's dragons, Jon riding Rhaegal and Daenerys riding Drogon. They find a waterfall where Jon used to hunt as a child and they share an intimate moment.{{Ref|GOT801}}

[[file:Dragon Riding S8 Ep 1.jpg|thumb|Jon rides Rhaegal for the first time.]]
Later, Jon meets up with Sansa, who is angry that Jon bent the knee to Daenerys. Jon says titles are not important when the Army of the Dead is coming and he is certain Daenerys will make a good queen for them. Sansa asks Jon if he bent the knee to save the North or because he loves Daenerys. Afterward, Daenerys and Jon see the dragons and she invites him to ride atop Rhaegal. While he initially finds it difficult, he soon gets used to it and flies alongside Daenerys. After landing, Jon and Daenerys kiss, which is interrupted by the dragons. Later, Jon reunites with Arya, he finds out that she is more loyal to Sansa than the Targaryen queen.{{Ref|GOT801}}

Later in the catacombs when he is lighting candles in remembrance of his family, Jon reunites with Sam. Sam asks him whether Jon knew that Daenerys executed [[Dickon Tarly|his brother]] and [[Randyll Tarly|father]]. Though Jon is surprised by this news, he tells Sam he has also executed men who disobeyed him. Sam responds Jon has also spared men when they've refused to kneel. Jon says he wasn't a king, prompting Sam to respond that Jon is a king. Jon responds that he gave up his crown. However, Sam reveals to Jon that he is the King of the Seven Kingdoms as Aegon Targaryen, the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. An angry Jon refuses to believe this as his father, Ned Stark, would never lie to him, but Sam says Ned lied to protect Jon. Jon insists Daenerys is their queen. Sam asks Jon if Daenerys would give up her crown for her people.{{Ref|GOT801}}

[[File:Jon & Arya S8 EP2.jpg|thumb|Jon plans the defense of Winterfell.]]
The Stark and Targaryen forces prepare to fight the dead near Winterfell. Bran offers himself as bait to lure the Night King for an ambush in the [[Godswood]] of Winterfell, and it is decided the dragons will protect Bran in the godswood. Later, when Jon is visiting Lyanna's statue in the crypts, Daenerys finds him. They share a moment and when she mentions her brother raped Lyanna, Jon tells Daenerys that Rhaegar didn't rape her, they were in love. Jon takes her hand and reveals his true parentage to her. Daenerys is skeptical and claims it is convenient that this came from Bran and Sam, Jon's brother and best friend. They are interrupted by sounds of horns which signal the arrival of the Night King's army.{{Ref|GOT802}}

During the [[Battle of Winterfell]], Jon rides atop Rhaegal and leads him in fighting the dead. He and Drogon battle the Night King and the undead Viserion with Rhaegal being heavily injured. Rhaegal is able to land on the ground but falls unconscious due to his injuries while landing, and Jon is knocked off from the dragon's top. He is wounded during the battle and is pinned down by Viserion. He manages to pull himself out and makes his way to Godswood to fight the Night King. On his way, he notices the army of the dead obliterating everyone fighting at Winterfell. Just when he is about to be overrun by the Wights himself, they seem to fall off to the ground one by one as the Night King is defeated by Arya.{{Ref|GOT803}}

After the battle, Jon leads a mass cremation for the dead and is hailed by the wildlings during the celebrations of the victory. After the celebrations, Daenerys meets up with Jon in his room. Jon offers his condolences for Jorah's death, and Daenerys affirms that Jorah loved her but she couldn't love him the way he wanted, not the way she loves Jon. She and Jon begin to kiss, preparing to have sex but Jon stops himself. Daenerys laments that Jon told her the truth of his parentage and is fearful people will press his claim against hers for the Iron Throne. Jon is vehement that he does not want the throne. Daenerys tells Jon it doesn't matter what he personally wants, people will press his claim. Jon tells Daenerys he will refuse and on his knee, declares Daenerys will always be his queen. Daenerys insists that he must never reveal his parentage to anyone but Jon tells Daenerys he owes his sisters the truth. He is certain they can all live happily together, but Daenerys says the only way that can happen is if Jon never tells the truth about himself and leaves.{{Ref|GOT804}}

While making the plans for attacking King's Landing, Daenerys wants to take the Red Keep, while Tyrion and Jon vouch for a siege in hopes this will reduce casualties. Sansa opts for letting their forces rest before charging into another battle. Jon, however, assures the queen that they will obey her command. Afterward, Sansa and Arya state that they do not trust her. When Jon defends Daenerys and says that they only have to get to know her, Sansa and Arya reply they never will as she is not one of them. Jon says he has never been a Stark, but they both insist he is. Pained, Jon looks at Bran, who says that it's his choice to tell them. Jon makes them both swear to never tell anyone the secret he is about to reveal to them. After they do, then at a loss for words, Jon tells Bran to reveal the truth of his parentage to them.{{Ref|GOT804}}

[[File:Jon & Varys S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Varys discusses the Iron Throne with Jon.]]
Jon marches to King's Landing along the Kingsroad with the surviving Stark, Arryn, and Dothraki forces unopposed while the [[Unsullied]] reach the capital ahead of them. Hopes for a peaceful surrender, however, are quickly extinguished with Missandei's execution.{{Ref|GOT804}} Later, Jon separates from his forces after crossing the [[Trident]] and heads back to Dragonstone. Varys informs him about Daenerys's unstable state of mind and is requested by him to take the Iron Throne, but he refuses.{{Ref|GOT805}}

[[File:Jon & Dany S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Jon discusses his parentage with Daenerys.]]
Daenerys later has Varys executed for treason. When Varys is burned alive by Drogon's flames, Jon is disturbed by the execution via fire. Later, Jon comes to see Daenerys, and she blames Jon for telling Sansa about her parentage for what happened. Jon states he doesn't want the crown which is what he told Varys, with Daenerys replying Sansa betrayed his trust and is as responsible for Varys' death as she is. Daenerys confides that the people of [[Westeros]] love Jon more than her, that all she has here is fear, not love. Jon tells Daenerys that he loves her and she will always be his queen. As she asks if that's all she is to him, the two kiss but Jon breaks it off, still hesitant over their blood ties. Daenerys accepts this but resigns herself to ruling by fear.{{Ref|GOT805}}

[[File:STARKENTOURAGEBE;;S.jpeg|thumb|Jon leads his forces into King's Landing.]]
During the [[Battle of King's Landing]], the Golden Company is caught off-guard by Drogon and as a result, is decimated by the charging Northern and Targaryen forces. The Lannister forces and people of King's Landing surrender. However, Daenerys and Drogon burn the streets filled with people as both the Targaryen and Northern forces start slaughtering the surrendered Lannister forces and civilians alike, as Jon tries in vain to hold them back. As a result, the Lannister forces clash again and Jon is forced to fight to deflect their attacks. He is horrified by the carnage that occurs despite his calls to stop it, and kills one of his soldiers trying to rape a woman. When the [[wildfire]] caches [[Wildfire plot|stored below the city years ago]] by Aerys start erupting due to Drogon's dragonfire, Jon orders his forces to evacuate.{{Ref|GOT805}}

[[File:Worm Jon S8 Ep6.jpg|thumb|Jon confronts Grey Worm over executing surrendered Lannister soldiers.]]
After the battle, Jon, Davos, and Tyrion observe in horror the ash-covered devastation wrought by Daenerys, with charred bodies strewn everywhere. Tyrion leaves for the Red Keep alone, and rejects Jon's suggestions to take some of his soldiers as guards. A little while later, Jon confronts [[Grey Worm]] and the Unsullied who are executing remaining surrendered Lannister soldiers. Grey Worm states that he has been ordered by Daenerys to execute all who followed Cersei. When Jon tries to stop him, the Unsullied and Stark soldiers almost come to blows, but Davos defuses the situation by telling Jon to take it up with the queen. As they walk away, they witness Grey Worm executing the captives.{{Ref|GOT806}}

[[File:Arya warns Jon S8 Ep6.png|thumb|Arya warns Jon against Daenerys.]]
At the Red Keep, Jon witnesses Daenerys giving a speech to her victorious forces, in which she declares she "liberated" the people of King's Landing and will "liberate" the world. Tyrion disavows his loyalty and being arrested for releasing Jaime. He then reunites with an injured Arya. Surprised, he asks why she was in King's Landing, to which Arya responds that she came to kill Cersei, but Daenerys got there first. She warns Jon that he will always be a danger to her because of his parentage and Sansa will never bend the knee to her.{{Ref|GOT806}}

[[File:Tyrion pleads Jon S8 Ep6.png|thumb|Tyrion pleads with Jon to take action against Daenerys.]]
A while later, Jon visits the imprisoned Tyrion, who expects he'll be executed soon. Tyrion admits that Varys was right all along about Daenerys. He warns Jon that she won't stop until she has "liberated" the world and rules it all. He recounts her atrocities but Jon states it happened because of the trauma from the loss of loved ones she suffered. Tyrion states he knows Jon doesn't want to betray her and knows Jon loves her, he loved her too. He admits he is asking Jon to do a terrible thing, but advises him to take action because she is now the greatest threat to the people. He warns that he'll always be in danger because of his parentage, and asks if his sisters will ever bend the knee. Jon responds they'll always be loyal, but Tyrion reasons that Sansa told him about Jon's parentage because she doesn't want Daenerys as the Queen. Jon responds that she can't choose, but Tyrion states he can and has to do it now.{{Ref|GOT806}}

[[File:Queen slayer.png|thumb|Jon holds Daenerys after assassinating her.]]
Troubled, Jon walks to the [[throne room]] and finds Daenerys standing by the Iron Throne. Jon confronts her about her atrocities during the battle. She displays no remorse, believing it was necessary to achieve her ends. Jon tries to dissuade her from this path, urging forgiveness for Tyrion and those in King's Landing. Daenerys rejects this, saying they can't hide behind mercy and states the world they need can't be built by those loyal to the current one. Jon says they need a world of mercy and Daenerys assures that the new world she has in mind will be a good one and she knows what is good. When Jon asks about others who think they know what is good, she responds they don't get to choose. She tries to convince him to be by her side to build her new world and an anguished Jon reaffirms his allegiance to her. As they share a passionate kiss, Jon reluctantly [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|stabs her]]. Daenerys collapses and dies in his arms as Jon grieves over her.

[[File:John-in-jail.png|thumb|Jon converses with Tyrion while being held as a prisoner.]]
The Unsullied imprison Jon for Daenerys's assassination. At a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]], where Jon and Tyrion are to be put on trial, only Tyrion is present with Grey Worm telling Sansa the Unsullied will decide Jon's fate. Sansa objects. Tyrion convinces Grey Worm to allow the new [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]] to decide Jon's punishment since the crime was committed in Westeros. Ultimately, Bran is elected as the king and decides to exile Jon to the Night's Watch in order to avoid a war between the North and the Unsullied. The new Hand of the King, Tyrion, later visits a dejected Jon and informs him he will be exiled to the Night's Watch. When Jon asks if there still is a Night's Watch, Tyrion responds the world still needs a refuge for bastards and broken men. Jon asks if what he did was right and Tyrion responds they did it together. Jon says killing Daenerys doesn't feel right. Tyrion tells Jon to ask him again in 10 years. Jon tells Tyrion he doesn't think they'll ever meet again but Tyrion responds he might want to piss off the top of the Wall after serving a few years as the Hand.{{Ref|GOT806}}

[[File:Stark Sibling's S8 Ep6.jpg|thumb|Jon bids farewell to his family.]]

Jon congratulates Sansa on gaining independence for the [[North]] and assures her she will be a good leader when she laments they lost their king before they hug. Jon then tells Arya that she could to visit him at Castle Black, but Arya states that she isn't going back North and plans to explore the uncharted seas to the west of Westeros before the two tearfully hug. Finally, Jon kneels before the new king Bran and apologizes for not being there when he needed him, but Bran states he was "exactly where he was supposed to be."{{Ref|GOT806}}

He then leaves with Ghost and the wildlings for lands north of the Wall, watching forlornly as the gate to Castle Black closes behind him, and then rides into the [[Haunted Forest]] alongside them.{{Ref|GOT806}}

==Personality==
{{ReferencesSection}}
{{Quote|You are a Stark. You may not have [[House Stark|my name]], but you have my blood.|[[Eddard Stark]] to Jon before he leaves for the [[Night's Watch]].|The Kingsroad}}Since he was raised by Ned at Winterfell, Jon has adopted a clear moral compass and a true sense of honor, which he tries his hardest to abide by even when he must make a difficult decision, especially after he became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He has always admired and idolized his father, but due to Catelyn's cold disdain for Jon, Eddard was careful not to give him more attention than his lawful children by Catelyn. Catelyn was never actively mean to Jon, but because he wasn't her own son she intentionally ignored him (as is common for bastard children), meaning that Jon grew up without a mother-figure. Nor did Jon consider Catelyn's behavior to be unusual or unexpected: it is rare for a noble to raise their bastard child alongside their lawful children, and his presence was a great insult to her honor.
While his interactions with Catelyn remained awkward or nonexistent, he was close with his half-siblings, particularly Robb and Arya. Robb was of the same age as Jon so they became playmates and comrades in training, while due to her tomboyish personality Arya was also something of a social misfit like Jon, which they bonded over. His closeness with Brandon and Rickon was proved when the latter had to leave Winterfell and Master Luwin advised them to go, Castle Black, where the old man was sure that their half-brother would keep them safe. With Sansa on the other hand, according to the talk they had when they reunited at Castle Black, the friendship has never been deep as those between Jon and the other siblings. Since then, however, Sansa proves to have great faith in her half-brother by standing up for him when he is King in the North and, when she discovers his true parentage, by seeing him as the best candidate to become King of the Seven Kingdoms. Also, when Jon is forced to join again the Night's Watch, Sansa shows great sorrow and thinks that sending Jon away is both a great unfairness and a great loss for the North.

Like many bastard children, Jon had to learn to grow up quickly. This made Jon mature and perceptive beyond his age, so he could navigate his complicated relationships within the Stark household. His bastard status has also made Jon something of a loner, solemn and somber with a desire to prove himself to society and to his father. Jon thought that the best way for a bastard in his position to gain honor and respect was to join the Night's Watch, emulating his uncle Benjen, because past social status is ignored after joining the Watch. Despite his introverted demeanor, Jon is very compassionate and protective of his fellow outcasts such as Sam, Grenn, and Pyp.

In many ways, Jon has been unusually lucky for a bastard child, given how rare it is for a lord to raise one in his own castle alongside his lawful children. For all of Jon's misgivings about not knowing his mother and Catelyn ignoring and shunning him, he was loved by his father and siblings, was never poor or hungry, but lived in a castle and had a noble's upbringing. Jon was formally educated by Maester Luwin and was trained in combat by [[Rodrik Cassel|Ser Rodrik Cassel]].

Jon is an excellent swordsman and a fierce fighter. He was capable of quickly slaying numerous men in battle, and taking on highly-skilled warriors much bigger than himself such as [[Styr]]. His skills initially made him somewhat arrogant when he was a new recruit at Castle Black until Tyrion pointed out that the other recruits were all far less fortunate than he was, with some of them having never trained with a sword in their lives. This humbles Jon, and he changes his behavior to be the champion of the other downtrodden recruits and helps train them by walking them through the swordplay techniques he knows.

The Starks were an interfaith household, with Eddard and Catelyn's children being exposed to not only the religion of the Old Gods worshiped by most Northmen, but also Catelyn's devout adherence to the Faith of the Seven. Because Jon had no real interaction with Catelyn and revered his father Eddard, he was not exposed to the Seven but proudly keeps to the Old Gods, and honors the traditions of his First Men ancestors. When Jon took his vow to become a member of the Night's Watch, he chose to do so in front of a heart tree, sacred to the Old Gods.

Jon is also fairly shy around women, and as he revealed to Samwell, he was a virgin when he joined the Night's Watch. While he was attractive enough, as a bastard son with nothing to inherit he had no realistic marriage prospects with noblewomen. Jon was even wary of having sex with random girls or prostitutes (as Theon did) because he was terrified of fathering a bastard of his own: having lived his life as a bastard, he felt that it wasn't a life another child should have to go through.

However, death has changed Jon. Despite his honorable convictions and previous commitment to the Night's Watch, his experience of being murdered by his own men and then revived has made Jon somewhat more cynical and nihilistic. No longer believing in himself and his ability to face the coming threat, due to being murdered for doing what he thought was right - Jon abandons the Night's Watch, despite knowing full well how dangerous the threat looming beyond the Wall really is. He loses his determination about fighting and becomes much more lonely and melancholic only speaking when he hasn't any other choice. Also, Jon feels remorse for hanging his former steward Olly, even though the latter did murder both him and the woman he loved. While he is wary of conflict since his return, his love for his family has brought him back into the fight. To this end, Jon chooses his family over the Night's Watch - a choice he once attempted to make when Robb marched off to war but forsook in the past. When Ramsay decides to play a "game" with Rickon, Jon once again chooses his family by attempting to save his little brother's life, even at the cost of his own life and battle plans.

The revelation that he is a Targaryen has made no difference to Jon; he has remained loyal to his roots as a Northman and a Stark.

==Relationships==
{{ReferencesSection}}
* [[Ygritte]]: She was Jon's first love and a wildling [[spear wife]]. They meet when Jon and his group ambush a group of wildlings, at which point Jon captures Ygritte. Ygritte later escapes and leads him into a trap in which Jon is captured by the wildlings. Under orders from Qhorin Halfhand, Jon infiltrates the wildlings. During this time, Ygritte and Jon become lovers and fall in love. However, Jon ultimately chooses his vows for the Night's Watch over her. Ygritte shoots him with three arrows but due to her feelings for Jon, she couldn't bring herself to kill him. In the [[battle for the Wall]], Ygritte was killed by Olly and died in Jon's arms. Later, per Tormund's suggestion that she belongs in the true North, Jon cremates her body just beyond the Wall as he grieves.
* [[Daenerys Targaryen]]: Jon's second love and the daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen, as well as the younger sister of Jon's father, Prince Rhaegar, making her his aunt by blood. Having been summoned from Winterfell to bend the knee to Daenerys, Jon initially refuses on the grounds that they need to focus on allying against the Night King and the army of the dead instead of worrying who rules from the Iron Throne. After witnessing the large numbers of the army of the dead, Daenerys agrees to help Jon and during their time together, they fall in love. They fight the Army of the Dead in the Battle of Winterfell, during which the Night King is defeated. With the Long Night prevented, Jon honors his pledge to help Daenerys take the Iron Throne. However, she razes King's Landing after the city surrenders, killing thousands of civilians. Unable to dissuade her from continuing this destruction, Jon reluctantly kills Daenerys, and she dies in Jon's arms as he grieves.

==Behind the scenes==
*During casting for the first season, Harington competed with fellow cast members [[Iwan Rheon]], [[Alfie Allen]] and [[Joe Dempsie]] for the role of Jon Snow. Rheon was later cast as [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow/Bolton]], Allen as [[Theon Greyjoy]] and Dempsie as [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]. Harington remains close friends with all three.
*Harington is contractually obligated to keep his hair long enough in the off-season that he can return to playing Jon Snow during actual filming - it would take longer than a full year for his hair to grow back to its full-length need for the role. To achieve Jon Snow's signature long dark hair, the TV series's hair designer [[Kevin Alexander]] first has to dye Harington's hair slightly darker; Then, to create the effect of dirty ringlets, he dampens the hair and then puts in a mixture of wax and hair putty before the hair totally dries. This combination keeps the curls soft and movable - if they were put on dry hair it would make it stiff.<ref>http://fashionista.com/2013/06/game-of-thrones-hair-designer-answers-all-our-pressing-questions</ref>
*Despite initial claims from Harington, Benioff, and Weiss that Jon had been killed off for good following the fifth season, Harington later hinted that Jon would return in some way, which was proven true in the sixth season. Harington confirmed that he had been told to lie to the rest of the cast and even his friends and family. [[Sophie Turner]], who plays Sansa Stark, apparently believed him, while [[Liam Cunningham]], who plays Davos Seaworth, did not (reportedly laughingly telling Harington to "fuck off"). Even the rest of the cast were forced to assert that Jon was dead, such as [[Maisie Williams]], [[Emilia Clarke]] and [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]], while [[Natalie Dormer]] said that Jon was "dead right now.....right now", hinting that he would return. Throughout production, the name "Jon Snow" was not even allowed to be mentioned except for script-readouts; he was referred to only as "LC" (Lord Commander). Rampant speculation broke out after the leaking of a photograph which showed Harington as Jon wearing the outfit of a House Stark soldier, fueling fans' beliefs that Jon was not gone for good. The first poster released for the sixth season featured a bloodied-but-apparently-alive Jon, further teasing that Jon would return. After the airing of "Home", Harington issued a public apology to the series' fanbase for lying to everyone and expressed appreciation for the fans' love for his character.
*While shooting Jon's showdown with Ramsay in "Battle of the Bastards", Harington actually punched Iwan Rheon twice by accident, though Rheon was not seriously hurt. In real life, despite having only appeared onscreen together in one episode of the entire series, Harington and Rheon are close friends.
*[[Marcus Shakesheff]] was a stunt double for [[Kit Harington]] in the role of Jon Snow.

==In the books==
[[File:Roman Papsuev - Jon Snow.png|thumb|300px|right|Jon Snow by Roman "Amok" Papsuev.©]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jon is 14 years old when the story begins. Jon resembles his father with a lean build, long face, and gray eyes, more than any of his true-born children (except Arya, to an extent, but she is a girl, while he looks very much like a young version of Eddard). Jon loves his half-siblings and among them, is closest with Robb and Arya.

Unlike in the television series, Jon has never been on good terms with Theon. Jon feels Theon is an "ass" and Theon feels Jon is jealous of his highborn status. Meanwhile, Theon resents Jon for being bastard-born but treated better than him by Eddard.

Eddard refuses to reveal who Jon's mother is, which wounds and haunts Jon. Jon often wonders about his mother and why Eddard will not say anything about her. While Jon loves and is loved by his family, he feels a sense of alienation from them because of his bastard status and the coldness of Eddard's wife. Catelyn views Jon as an interloper in her family and resents that Eddard brought Jon to live at Winterfell with her true-born children, fearing it means Ned still carries a torch for Jon's mother.

At the feast to welcome King Robert, Jon is unable to sit with his family as he usually does because Catelyn fears that the king or queen would take insult at sharing a table with a bastard. Instead, Jon sits with squires at another table. This coincides with the visit by his uncle Benjen, and (emboldened by having more than he is used to drinking) makes Jon realize that his future may lie outside Winterfell's walls. His uncle frustrates Jon by telling him to wait a few years before deciding, but when Eddard decides to go to King's Landing, Catelyn refuses to allow Jon to remain behind at Winterfell. Catelyn was relieved because when Jon joined the Watch he forsook any right to inheritance, and could never challenge her own sons for Winterfell. Nor did Catelyn have to pressure Jon into joining: he went to the Wall of his own volition, albeit because he had been raised on legends of the former glories of the Night's Watch.

There is no mention in the books that Jon caught the pox as a child and Catelyn, out of guilt, prayed for him to survive: in ''A Game of Thrones'', Catelyn states outright that she wishes it was Jon who had fallen from the broken tower in Bran's place.

Jon is crestfallen to discover that the Watch is now a glorified penal colony, full of murderers, rapers, and other outcasts, and few of the recruits are like his uncle.

The prostitute character [[Ros]] was invented for the TV series, so Jon never tried to have sex with her only to back down from it in the end out of fear of fathering a bastard - though the novels do have Jon make some similar statements that he is horrified at the thought of creating bastard children of his own who would be looked down upon with nothing to inherit, as he grew up, thus the overall point that Jon didn't really have any experience with women before joining the Watch basically stands.

Jon severely burned his right hand when he killed the wight Othor to save Jeor Mormont's life. While he lost no function in it, as a result of the burns his right hand and some of his forearm were left covered in scar tissue, which would never heal back to normal. People tend not to notice, because in the cold temperatures at the Wall and beyond, Jon and other members of the Night's Watch usually wear heavy gloves over both hands.

Jon didn't see a White Walker taking one of Craster's sons in the forest as he did in the TV series. When Mance Rayder later asks him why he would betray the Night's Watch to join the wildlings, Jon instead point out that it is because he will always be treated with scorn as a bastard, pointing out how back at the feast of Winterfell he wasn't allowed to sit at the main table with the "real" Starks.

After Jon kills Orell, part of Orell's consciousness survives by [[warg]]ing into his eagle, after which Orell's mind controlling the eagle's body attempts to claw out Jon's eye with its talons (which occurred in Season 3 of the TV series). The attack leaves permanent deep scars over Jon's eye. However, rather than disfiguring him, characters within the narrative point out that they think it makes him ruggedly handsome. Stereotypical Fantasy heroes usually never get significantly hurt, at worst getting scars running over their eyes which make them look "cool." Author George R.R. Martin spent much of the books deconstructing or subverting traditional Fantasy literature stereotypes, making Westeros a gritty and realistic setting where instead of all of the main characters miraculously surviving through battles unscathed, some are horribly maimed (i.e. Jaime and Tyrion do not get dashingly roguish scars over their eyes - they outright lose their sword hand and nose, respectively). In contrast, Jon actually does behave like a traditionally heroic character, but put in the dark setting of Westeros - and as a result, Jon does end up getting "cool hero scars" over his eye.

The subplot in Season 4 in which Jon [[Raid on Craster's Keep|returns to Craster's Keep]] to finish off the mutineers there (that never occurs in the novels), and nearly encounters Bran again, was an invention of the TV series: in the books, the battle for the Wall begins soon after Jon returns, but due to the way the TV seasons were split, Jon returned at the end of Season 3 - even though the battle would only take place as the climax at the end of Season 4. Jon, therefore, had to have something to do in the earlier parts of the season.

Unbeknownst to Jon, late in the third novel Robb names him as his heir: since Jeyne Westerling has not given him heirs yet, Bran and Rickon are reported as dead, Arya is missing, and Sansa was forced to marry Tyrion - the Lannisters could lay claim to the North. Robb realizes that he needs to name a new heir, because if he dies there will be no obvious successor to challenge the Lannister's claim through Sansa, and decides Jon is the best choice - given that Robb is a king, he can simply issue a decree legitimizing Jon. Catelyn pleads with Robb not to choose Jon, and instead pick a ''very'' distant cousin from [[House Royce]], but Robb does not listen to her. He signs the decree in the presence of several of his northern lords as witnesses. However, it is unknown what has become of the decree, as it is no longer mentioned in the books. It is speculated that Robb has given it to [[Maege Mormont]] and [[Galbart Glover]], whom he sent on a mission to seek out Howland Reed (therefore they do not attend the Red Wedding), but their current location is unknown. So far in the books, Jon has not received the decree, and has no idea of its existence.

Jon is tempted by Stannis's offer to make him Lord of Winterfell, but feels guilt and shame over this due to his love for his lost trueborn siblings, whom Jon believes have all passed away (later, in ''A Dance with Dragons'', Jon becomes aware Sansa is alive, although he does not know her current whereabouts, and tells Stannis that Winterfell belongs to her by right). Jon likewise has reservations because he is an illegitimate son and is bound by his oath to the Watch. Stannis assures Jon he can legitimize him, and Winterfell can be rebuilt. As for the oath: Melisandre tells Jon "R'hllor is the only true god. A vow sworn to a tree has no more power than one sworn to your shoes. Open your heart and let the light of the Lord come in. Burn these weirwoods, and accept Winterfell as a gift of the Lord of Light." Jon thinks it over, recalling how when he was very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, he used to dream that one day Winterfell might be his. Later, when he was older, he had been ashamed of those dreams. Now, in order to claim his father's castle, he must turn against his father's gods. The more Jon thinks about it, he grows to loathe the notion of destroying the weirwood of Winterfell. He looks at Ghost, whose white fur and red eyes remind him of a heart tree, and Jon remembers finding the direwolf pups in the late summer snow with Robb - five grey, black, and brown pups for the five trueborn children and a sixth one, "white as snow." This is what makes him reject the legitimization offer. Had Jon accepted the offer, it is doubtful the people of the north would have accepted him as their Lord - who is both an oathbreaker and a defiler of the old gods.

In the books, after Jon is elected the new Lord Commander, he knows he must deal with Slynt and Thorne, who did their best to get him killed and will probably undermine him. Jon wouldn't abuse his authority in order to settle the score with them (especially with Slynt, who took part in [[Massacre in the Red Keep|Ned's downfall]] and subsequent death, which Jon is aware of); he firmly reminds himself that once someone joins the Watch - his past deeds are erased clean. He wisely decides to separate them by sending Slynt away and keeping Thorne - whom he considers the more dangerous - close to him. Jon orders Slynt to take command of Greyguard and restore it, but Slynt refuses three times, in an extremely obnoxious and disrespectful manner. Jon executes Janos Slynt for that insubordination, and is somewhat disappointed that Thorne did not attempt to defend him. Later, Jon sends Thorne and eight other rangers to scout beyond the Wall. Throne obeys, but does not leave quietly: he makes it clear he believes Jon is deliberately sending him on a suicide mission, and ominously warns Jon that he will return to Castle Black, one way [[Wight|or another]]. Thorne has not returned yet and his fate is unknown, therefore he is not among those who attack Jon later.

One of the goals that Jon intends to achieve as the new Lord Commander of the Watch is to restore and garrison as many of the sixteen abandoned castles as possible, by both members of the Watch and wildlings. So far, most of those castles have been garrisoned, but are badly undermanned.

Stannis often consults with Jon, who serves as his unofficial advisor, about his next moves. Jon is aware that by advising Stannis, he is walking on very thin ice: the Watch must not get involved in the political conflicts south of the Wall; on the other hand, the Watch owes Stannis a great debt: without him, the wildlings would have eventually overcome the defenders of Castle Black, and he considers Stannis a lesser evil than the Boltons and ironborn currently terrorizing the north. Jon dissuades Stannis from taking potentially disastrous actions like granting northern castles to southron lords and the plan to attack the [[Dreadfort]] (an idea brought up by the treacherous Arnolf Karstark, who secretly collaborates with the Boltons); instead, he advises Stannis to gain the support of the Northern mountain clans and to [[Fight by Deepwood Motte|liberate Deepwood Motte from the ironborn]]. Stannis accepts both advice, and as a result, his position greatly improves: he gains the support of many northern houses, and his army grows more than three times.

Unbeknown to Jon, Cersei plots against him: she receives his letter that the Night's Watch takes no side, asking for arms and manpower, but has given Stannis food and shelter. She informs the small council, claiming this is treason. Most of the council members suggest imposing sanctions on the Night's Watch. Qyburn has a more devious plan: to send a hundred men to the Wall, allegedly to take the black, but in truth to kill Jon. Cersei accepts [[Qyburn]]'s advice and intends to send Osney Kettleblack with a hundred men to the Wall for that purpose, but as things turn to be, that scheme is never executed.

Though Jon initially has the support of almost the entire Night's Watch, he earns the distrust of most by proposing an alliance with the wildlings so that they will not fall into the hands of the White Walkers.

In the meantime, Melisandre tells Jon of visions she has had concerning "[[Mutiny at Castle Black|daggers in the dark]]" and a girl in grey riding on a dying horse for Castle Black, running away from a forced marriage, claiming it is his sister Arya. Jon initially believes the girl in question is indeed Arya, whom he hears is marrying Ramsay Bolton; the girl, however, turns to be neither Arya nor [[Jeyne Poole|her impostor]], but Alys Karstark, who informs Jon of the Karstarks' plan to betray Stannis to the Boltons. Unfortunately, Melisandre's mistake results in Jon ignoring her warning about "daggers in the dark", which turns to be correct.

Jon, loyal to his oaths, states that he has no sister and cannot help her, although he is anxious to. Melisandre, however, reveals to Jon that Mance Rayder is actually still alive, since she used her powers to disguise him as Rattleshirt (and Rattleshirt as Mance, which led him to being burned in Mance's place). She persuades Jon to send Mance to rescue Arya from Winterfell.

Jon also meets [[Tycho Nestoris]], a representative of the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] who has come to negotiate with Stannis, due to Cersei's consistent refusal to pay the crown's debts. Jon secures a loan from Nestoris for ships and food for the Night's Watch, and instructs him on where to find Stannis and warn him of the Karstarks' betrayal.

Jon arranges a mission to Hardhome to rescue the remaining wildlings there; unlike in the show, he does not join the mission himself, but instead sends [[Cotter Pyke]] there. Some time later, Jon receives desperate reports by messenger-raven that they are under siege by wights.

As Jon prepares to head out to Hardhome to rescue them, he receives a letter from Ramsay (often referred to as "the Pink Letter"), who taunts Jon by claiming that he has killed Stannis, destroyed his army and taken Mance prisoner, and demanding [[Jeyne Poole|his bride]], "[[Theon Greyjoy|Reek]]", Melisandre, Stannis's family, Mance's son and sister-in-law. Ramsay closes the letter by threatening to march on the Wall and destroy the Night's Watch if Jon does not agree, and "I will cut out your bastard heart and eat it."

Jon now realizes that he can't defend Castle Black from attack from the south (the Wall is located north of the castle) even as the Boltons are tearing the realm apart from the south. He reads the letter aloud in Castle Black's courtyard, and announces that he will ride south to confront and kill Ramsay himself - which might be construed as breaking the Watch's strict vow of political neutrality. Jon argues that the neutrality goes both ways, and Ramsay cannot just ''threaten to kill'' the head of the Night's Watch with impunity. Jon ultimately receives a very similar letter in the TV series, although it is after his resurrection - and unlike in the novels, Sansa is there to witness it (Sansa never married Ramsay in the novels, so this change was thrown in to increase the emotional impact of the scene - which could also explain delaying the letter until after Jon abandoned the Night's Watch).

But this is the last straw for many of the older Watch officers who were growing increasingly annoyed at Jon's decisions, especially about accepting the wildlings to the Watch. Moreover, they had the somewhat legitimate fear that if Jon fought Ramsay and ''lost'', the Boltons would destroy the entire Night's Watch on the accusation that they were implicit in his actions. As Jon is preparing to leave, a fight breaks out with the giant [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun|Wun Wun]]. Jon tries to talk everyone down to prevent more loss of life and the mutineers choose the moment to stab Jon. The mutineers are led not by Alliser Thorne (who has been sent earlier by Jon to scout beyond the Wall and has not returned, his fate is unknown) but by Bowen Marsh, who openly weeps as he does so very reluctantly and says "for the Watch." Subsequent mutineers each walk up and stab Jon as well, but as he loses consciousness he doesn't recognize them (the chapter is narrated from Jon's POV). Olly is not present as the character was invented for the TV series and doesn't exist in the novels - he is loosely a condensation of half a dozen other characters Jon trusted. Jon collapses, smoke rising from his wounds, and the last word he utters is "[[Ghost]]..." as he hears his direwolf howling.

Jon's resurrection in the television series implies that he will return in ''The Winds of Winter''.

===R+L=J===
There were numerous hints since the first novel that Eddard was lying about who Jon's mother was, and that he might even be the son of Eddard's ''sister'' Lyanna and Rhaegar, making Jon the secret heir to the Iron Throne. In the twenty years since the first novel was released through Season 6 of the TV series, this theory was popularly known in the books' fandom by the abbreviation "'''R+L=J'''" - for "Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon." The theory was confirmed to be half true in the Season 6 finale when it was revealed that Lyanna was Jon's mother. A few days later HBO released an info graph revealing that Rhaegar is Jon's father, fully confirming the theory to be true.<ref>http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2694059.1467293514!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/lvsnow1f.jpg</ref>

Various hints included that Eddard gave inconsistent and indeed contradicting accounts of who Jon's mother was, indicating that he was lying about ''something'', and also the conspicuous fact that Lyanna died shortly before Ned returned to the North with the infant Jon: hinting that Lyanna died in childbirth. There were also many hints (still unconfirmed) that Lyanna didn't actually love Robert, and she ''ran off'' with Rhaegar - particularly that everyone except for Robert himself describes Rhaegar as a chivalrous, intellectual, kind man who didn't seem the sort to randomly rape the daughter of a major noble House. Another major hint was that Rhaegar had the three greatest members of the Kingsguard (two in the TV version) including [[Arthur Dayne]] sit out the ''entire'' war, purely to guard Lyanna at the Tower of Joy.

Unbeknownst to Jon, his half-brother [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia Martell, is alive, as revealed in the fifth novel (Varys switched him with another baby, whom [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] killed during the [[Sack of King's Landing]]); he has recently arrived at Westeros with his guardian [[Jon Connington]] and nearly half of the [[Golden Company]], to claim his birthright. Since the marriage of Rhaegar and Elia has never been annulled (it is an invention of the TV show), Aegon has a stronger claim than Daenerys for the Iron Throne, but it is unclear whether he is ahead of Jon too, since it has not been revealed yet in the books whether Rhaegar married Lyanna or not.

It should be noted that Aegon's book character has not been merged with Jon's show character, just because they have the same first name; Aegon is considered dead in the show.

It has long been believed in Westeros that only members of the Targaryen bloodline can easily bond with and ride dragons - which is one of the reasons they so readily accepted Daenerys (though that was also because she hatched them, becoming their adoptive mother). The revelation about Jon's real parentage means that he may potentially bond with one of Daenerys's three dragons in a future novel - after all, she has ''three'' dragons but only personally rides Drogon, the largest. To a lesser extent, this might also be true of the Baratheons - Robert was Rhaegar's second cousin in the books. With the deaths of Stannis and Shireen in the TV series, the only living member of the Baratheon bloodline is Robert's bastard son Gendry (who is, in fact, Jon's third cousin). House Martell also intermarried with the Targaryens but not recently, about a century ago: in the books [[Doran Martell]]'s middle son Quentyn (cut from the TV show) traveled to Meereen and explicitly hoped his small amount of Targaryen blood would be enough to make the dragons trust him and try to mount one, but he was instead burned alive by Rhaegal.
