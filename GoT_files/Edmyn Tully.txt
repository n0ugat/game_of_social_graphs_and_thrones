{{Quote|In return for Edmyn's service, House Tully was made Aegon's new Lord Paramount of the Trident and all the other lords had to swear us fealty.|[[Brynden Tully]]|House Tully (short)}}
Lord '''Edmyn Tully''' was the [[Lord of Riverrun]] and a vassal of King [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]].

==Biography==
Edmyn rebelled against his liege, [[Harren Hoare]], when [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] [[Aegon's Conquest|invaded]] [[Westeros]]. After the elimination of Harren and his entire line at the [[Burning of Harrenhal]], Aegon rewarded Edmyn by elevating the Tullys to rule over the [[Riverlands]] (under the Targaryens), even though they had never ruled the Riverlands as kings - indeed, the Riverlands had been occupied by powerful neighboring kingdoms for centuries, and before that were rarely politically unified. Aegon made Edmyn Tully the first [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]],{{Ref|H&L306}} a title his family would hold up until the [[Red Wedding]].{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lord Edmyn was the first of the riverlords who turned against their king Harren; his act encouraged the other lords to revolt as well. As a result, House Tully was greatly rewarded by the Targaryens.
