{{Quote|Meanwhile, across the Narrow Sea, a new religion was born in the hills of Andalos. According to legend, the God of Seven revealed itself to the Andals, and the invasion of Westeros followed soon after. The Andals sailed across the sea on ships, armed with weapons of steel.

'''Andalos''',{{Ref|H&L103}} also known as the '''Hills of Andalos''',{{Ref|H&L103}} is a region on the continent of [[Essos]], located on the coast between the [[Free Cities]] of [[Pentos]] and [[Braavos]], west of the [[Rhoyne]] River. It is the ancestral home of the [[Andals]], an ancient people who, according to tradition, invaded [[Westeros]] six thousand years ago and are the ancestors of most of the people living in the southern half of the continent.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Andalos was once a powerful kingdom extending across much of northwestern Essos west of the Rhoyne River, including the Velvet Hills and the [[Flatlands]]. It was a contemporary of the early [[Rhoynar]] kingdom, and according to Rhoynish histories the Rhoynar taught the Andals how to forge iron (disputing Andal legends, which insist they were directly taught by the [[Smith]]). The area was originally home to a race of Hairy Men who were related to the men of [[Ib]]ben. The Andals, who had previously been living further east in the [[Axe]] peninsula, displaced them through warfare. The [[Faith of the Seven]] was born in Andalos when the [[Father]] gave Hugor of the Hill a crown made of seven stars, while the [[Maiden]] gave Hugor his wife, who bore him forty-four sons.

Some time later, the Andals abandoned the region to colonize Westeros across the [[Narrow Sea]]. They [[Coming of the Andals|overran and conquered most of the western continent]], leaving Andalos deserted, and various other migrations of different Easterners moved into the region over the course of the subsequent six thousand years. The [[Valyrians]] established the city of [[Pentos]] there millennia later, in the south of the region. The northern coast became part of the [[Braavosian Coastlands]]. Even in the present day, the inhabitants of Pentos seem quite similar in appearance to the Andals of Westeros, and it is theorized that many of them descend from local Andals who were conquered by the Valyrians and incorporated into their new colony there.

The term "Hills of Andalos" has gained some traction in fan circles, as a term originating from [[George R.R. Martin]] reading a chapter from ''A Dance with Dragons'' some years ago. However, in the published novels the term "Velvet Hills" was used instead.
