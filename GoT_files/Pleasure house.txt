A '''pleasure house'''{{Ref|GOT102}} is an establishment in [[Essos]] similar to a brothel. Instead of [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] that have chosen this life as a means to survive, pleasure houses usually employ bedslaves, [[Slavery|slaves]] trained in the "arts of love" and forced to perform sexual acts for the gain of their owners.

The Free City of [[Lys]] is particularly known for its pleasure houses, which cater to every taste. The city of [[Yunkai]] in [[Slaver's Bay]] is one of the main suppliers of bedslaves for pleasure houses. [[Braavos]] makes use of brothels instead of pleasure houses, since slavery is illegal in that city.
