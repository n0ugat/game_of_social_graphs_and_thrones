The '''Lonely Light'''{{Ref|H&L601}} is one of the [[Iron Islands]], located near the border of the unexplored waters of the [[Sunset Sea]].

The Iron Islands are formed in two clusters. The main group is composed of about 30 islands, including seven major ones; there is also a small secondary cluster, however, a few days' sail to the west. It is composed of a dozen rocky outcroppings and atolls, of which only the Lonely Light is inhabited.<ref>"[[The Old Way]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', the Lonely Light is the smallest of the eight major Iron Islands. It is one of the westernmost locations of the [[known world]], approximately eight days' sail west of [[Great Wyk]]. Aside from a cadet branch of House Farwynd, currently ruled by Lord Gylbert Farwynd, the Lonely Light is inhabited by seals and sea lions.
