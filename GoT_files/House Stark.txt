[[File:House Stark banner.jpg|thumb|200px|The banner of House Stark of [[Winterfell]], the rulers of the [[North]].]]
'''House Stark'''{{Ref|GOT101}} of [[Winterfell]] is a [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]] and the royal house of the [[North|Kingdom of the North]]. They rule over the vast region known as the [[North]]. It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years. Before [[Aegon's Conquest]], as well as during the [[War of the Five Kings]] and early on in the [[Last War]], the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the [[King in the North|Kings in the North]].

Their rule in the North seemingly ended after the events of the [[Red Wedding]] when [[House Frey]] and [[House Bolton]] betrayed House Stark after forming a secret alliance with [[House Lannister]], during which [[Roose Bolton]] murdered King [[Robb Stark]]. Both the North and Winterfell were taken over by House Bolton. However, the Boltons' hold was jeopardized when [[Sansa Stark]] escaped their clutches after learning her brothers [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]] were still alive and reunited with her half-brother, [[Jon Snow]], at [[Castle Black]]. Sansa and Jon marched on the Boltons to save their younger brother Rickon, who was later murdered by [[Ramsay Bolton]], and retake Winterfell. House Stark was restored to their former stature after the [[Battle of the Bastards]]. The Stark victory led to House Stark's return to royal status in the North with their bannermen declaring Jon as the King in the North. He later abdicated his title as king in order to gain the full support of [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in the [[Great War]], becoming the [[Warden of the North]]. Following the [[Battle of King's Landing]], [[Bran Stark]] was [[Great Council in the Dragonpit|chosen]] as the new [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]], allowing the North to secede as an independent kingdom under Sansa.

House Stark's [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a grey [[direwolf]] on a white background, over green. They are one of the few noble houses whose [[House words|words]] are not a boast or threat. Instead, the House Stark family motto is a warning, one that, no matter the circumstances, will always be relevant: "Winter Is Coming,"<ref name=":0">"[[House Stark (short)|House Stark]]"</ref><ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref> which served as a reminder of their beginnings in the wake of the Long Night and a grim portent of things to come.

House Stark, as the only [[First Men]] dynasty to resist the [[coming of the Andals]], proudly hold on to the worship of the [[Old Gods]]. Due to their rule over the [[North]] and knowledge of it's troubles, they are unfailing supporters of the importance of the [[Night's Watch]], despite it's fall from glory in current times. As one of the last remaining [[Valyrian steel]] items, from [[Old Valyria]], House Stark greatly treasures it's ancestral sword of [[Ice]], which has been used in battles and executions. 

==History==
===Background===
Before [[Aegon's Conquest]], the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the [[King in the North|Kings in the North]].<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark entry]</ref> The house traces its roots to [[Brandon the Builder|Bran the Builder]], a legendary [[First Men|First Man]] who lived during the [[Age of Heroes]] and founded House Stark. The Starks were not originally the monarchs of the North; they began as vassals to the [[Barrow King]]s, who lost support due to their inactive rule while their ancestor Bran the Builder built the [[Wall]] and protected the [[North]]. They [[Thousand Years War|warred]] with the Barrow Kings, emerging victorious. The Starks ruled as Kings of Winter over one of the many smaller, petty First Men [[king]]doms that were established in the [[North]], with their chief rivals for domination being the [[Red King]]s of [[House Bolton]]. Eventually the Starks [[Unification of the North|united the North]] under them. Although their stronghold of [[Winterfell]] has been the capital of the North, war helped make it it's strongest castle, in opposition to the [[House Reed|Reeds]]' [[Greywater Watch]] and the [[Dreadfort]] of [[House Bolton]], with attacks from from the latter raising the need for more keeps, more walls, more guard towers and the expansion of their granaries and larders to survive sieges. [[Winter town]] would be raised from smallfolk seeking shelter from winter, and these would also join the Stark soldiers in fighting the Boltons. 

They gained a new vassal from the [[Reach]] after [[House Manderly]]'s exile, giving them a new home at [[White Harbor]] in exchange for their guarding the river against pirates. They defeated the Boltons, drove pirates away from the [[White Knife]], slew the last [[Marsh King]] and wed his daughter for the [[Neck]], with it's governance being given to [[House Reed]] and, according to legend, King [[Rodrik Stark]] wrestled with an [[Ironborn]] for [[Bear Island]] and won, giving it to House Mormont. [[Karlon Stark]], a younger son of the King in the North, was awarded lands in the eastern regions of the North after successfully putting down a rebellion led by House Bolton. Over time Karlon's seat of Karl's Hold came to be known as [[Karhold]], and the Starks that descended from him became known as [[House Karstark|Karstarks]].

Although the Starks had to content with defiant Houses in their unification campaign, some chose to submit and become loyal vassals, like the [[House Umber|Umbers]] of [[Last Hearth]] and the [[House Glover|Glovers]] of [[Deepwood Motte]], with even their greatest rivals for dominance, the Red Kings of House Bolton, who made a sinister reputation for themselves with their practice of [[flaying]], with [[Royce IV Bolton|one]] of them being notorious for ripping out the entrails of captive Starks, choosing to bend the knee, and their hostility being put on hold, due to the need for the end of unrest. Their timing proved crucial  just then, due to the [[Andals]] landing and [[Coming of the Andals|invading]] Westeros, swiping all lands of First Men rule except the North due to the other Houses fighting on their own, while the North opposed with a united front, with the Manderlys attacking their ships and the Reeds attacking their incursions into the [[Neck]]. 

King [[Torrhen Stark]] was on the throne at the time of [[Aegon's Conquest]] and marched his army south to face them. He surrendered when he saw the Targaryens' greater host and their [[dragon]]s, despite being suggested to resist from [[Moat Cailin]] or assassinating the sleeping dragons, believing that fighting was futile, due to the Targaryen victories at the [[Burning of Harrenhal]] and the [[Field of Fire]]. He was made [[Warden of the North]], thus escaping the fates of [[House Gardener]] of the [[Reach]] and [[House Hoare]] of the [[Riverlands]] whose lords refused to [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] and were rendered extinct after failing to resist the invaders. Thereafter, Torrhen was known as "the king who knelt", though those who criticize him for this often forget that they are only alive to do so thanks to his surrender.

Centuries later, Lady [[Lyanna Stark]] was taken by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], and when her [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]] demanded justice, King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] had them both viciously executed. [[Eddard Stark]] claimed his father's titles and participated in [[Robert's Rebellion]].<ref>"[[The Last Dragons]]"</ref> At the end of the rebellion, Eddard found his sister in the Tower of Joy, where she perished in a bed of blood.

Eddard is married to Lady [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]] of [[Riverrun]], and has five children with her: [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]], and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]]. He also has a rumored bastard son, [[Jon Snow]], who is actually the offspring of Prince Rhaegar and Lady Lyanna.

He is subsequently [[Execution of Eddard Stark|executed]] for [[treason]].

==Current status==
The status of the surviving Starks and what political positions they held was not fully clear after [[Jon Snow]] was hailed as the new [[King in the North]], by not only the lords of the [[North]], but the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] as well. The return of Bran and Arya to Winterfell clarified the ambiguity of all of their political positions in the North.

While Jon ruled as the King in the North, Sansa attended court alongside him as the [[Lord of Winterfell|Lady of Winterfell]]. In his absence, Jon gave Sansa [[regent|regency]] over the [[North|Kingdom of the North]] as both his sister and the only Stark (the highest ranking and ruling family in the North) in Winterfell used as precedent.

When [[Bran Stark]], the rightful Lord of Winterfell, returned to Winterfell, he abdicated his lordship for his new role as the [[Three-Eyed Raven]]. Once Arya returned to Winterfell, Sansa and Petyr note Arya is next in the line of succession for the lordship of Winterfell. Jon is believed to be Eddard's [[bastard]] son, which means would not be included in the line of succession, unless he were to be legitimized as a Stark.

However, Jon [[Bending the knee|pledged himself]] to Daenerys, in order to gain her full support in the [[Great War]], stepping down as king and accepted the title and role of [[Warden of the North]]. Presently, the North and Vale are reintegrated into the Seven Kingdoms.<ref name="E66">"[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"</ref> As of the end of Season 7, the current positions of the surviving members of House Stark are as follows: Jon is [[Warden of the North]], Sansa is [[Lord of Winterfell|Lady of Winterfell]], Arya is Sansa's heir, and Bran abdicated his claim to any formal political position.

Jon Snow is actually the son of Eddard's ''younger sister'', [[Lyanna Stark]], and according to the normal line of succession, would rank behind both Sansa and [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. At the same time, as the trueborn son of [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and Lyanna Stark, Jon is currently the heir to the [[Iron Throne]]. [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]], with the help of [[Gilly]], confirmed through [[High Septon]] [[High Septon (Robert's Rebellion)|Maynard]]'s personal diary that Rhaegar had his marriage to [[Elia Martell]] annulled and then was remarried to Lyanna.<ref name="E65">"[[Eastwatch]]"</ref><ref name="E67">"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref>

At a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]], Bran was chosen as the new [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms|Lord of the Six Kingdoms]], with the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] being elected by the lords of Westeros rather than inheriting the crown through a royal bloodline. The North has been granted independence with Sansa being declared the Queen in the North as a hereditary monarch.

==Military strength==
[[File:Robb-stark-richard-madden-helen-sloan.jpeg|thumb|Robb Stark in Northern cavalry armor.]]
During [[Robert's Rebellion]], the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] and the [[War of the Five Kings]], House Stark is able to field thousands of men and has proven itself capable in times of conflict, fighting and prevailing with many engagements within each conflict. Out of 18,000 Northerners that Robb Stark marched south to confront the Lannisters, a large amount of them were Stark soldiers.<ref>"[[The Pointy End]]"</ref> However, the [[Red Wedding]] greatly weakened the once formidable great house, leading to the destruction of the Stark army. Despite this, House Stark managed to [[Battle of the Bastards|retake Winterfell]] from [[House Bolton]], hence the Stark army was restored. 
[[File:Stark soldier during battle..jpeg|150px|thumb|left|A Stark man-at-arms.]]
The average Stark soldier wears a brown or dark blue coat with green or grey sleeves, with chainmail worn under it and a suit of studded leather armor worn over it; he also wears a pair of grey or brown leather boots. The soldiers are often equipped with helmets and round shields of steel or iron, both grey in color and the shields emblazoned with the Stark direwolf. Warriors in the Northern heavy cavalry or heavy infantry wear relatively cheap brigandine armor, with many choosing to wear mail underneath as well, rather than the expensive plate armor of the well-equipped Lannister troops.

After the end of the War of Five Kings, House Stark takes part in the [[Battle of Winterfell]], during the [[Great War]], where the House's forces suffer heavy casualties.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref> The remaining Stark forces later partake in the [[Battle of King's Landing]] alongside the Vale and Targaryen troops, apparently not taking significant losses.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:The Wall.jpg|200px|thumb|A view on the areas [[Beyond the Wall]] from "[[Winter Is Coming]]", an area the Starks must deal with every generation.]]
The House Stark banner, a direwolf on a white background, is a reference to their northern origin and lifestyle. Throughout the history of Westeros, the Starks have always had a fear of the impending threat of the White Walkers. This manner of life has bred extraordinary stoicism and loyalty within the Starks, one of their chief characteristics. Their surname, "Stark", one reminiscent of the First Men, is an accurate description of where they come from: the barren land of the North. However, white can also be seen as an isolated color, a point made perfectly clear throughout the series.

[[File:Baelor PORTAL.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Eddard Stark]] about to be executed on the orders of [[Joffrey Baratheon]] in "[[Baelor]]."]]
The House Stark motto, Winter Is Coming, is different to all the other mottos of Westeros. In ''A Game of Thrones'', Catelyn muses ''"...they'' [other noble houses] ''boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is Coming, said the Stark words."''{{Bookref|AGOT|2}}

It is significant that the Starks do not use their motto to remind of their positive attributes, but rather to remind people to look up at the more impending doom, and a bigger fight up ahead. Their determination to face the odds shows that they are made of different stuff then the [[Southerner]]s, and are not into their political games of intrigue. Perhaps these are the differences that make the Starks so persecuted, with only three actual Starks (Sansa, Arya, and Bran, or four counting Jon, who is at least half-Stark) alive by the end of the show, as opposed to the six at the beginning of the show (counting Catelyn and Jon). Their differences are even seen in the way they talk, such as when Ned infuriates Robert by calling him: "too fat for his armor" when [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] was not able to put it on properly.

The sigil of House Stark, a direwolf, is also symbolic. For starters, the direwolf mother who gave birth to the cubs featured in the series is found with a deer antler sticking out of the mother's side, representing the fact that Ned's downfall was brought on by him accepting the position of Hand of the King. The names of the cubs are also symbolic. Like direwolves, the Starks are loyal and protective, and, like the direwolves, almost go extinct. Sansa names her direwolf Lady, representing her dreams of being Queen Consort to Joffrey, whom she describes as handsome. However, Lady is eventually killed for another wolf's crimes (see below), representing how Sansa's youthfulness died after Joffrey tortured her for most of Season 2 in King's Landing, until he married Margaery Tyrell. Arya names her direwolf Nymeria, after a warrior princess from the Age of A Hundred Kingdoms, a fitting depiction of Arya's warrior spirit. When Nymeria attacks Joffrey, Arya sends her away to avoid her being "executed", and Lady is thus punished for the crime (see above). This is foreshadowing of the way Arya flees King's Landing at the end of Season 1 to the Wall. The losing of the wolf also symbolises that Arya is uncertain of what her future holds. Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind, is absolutely inseparable from him. During the Red Wedding, the Freys lock Grey Wind in a cage and kill him, just as they do with Robb. Bran's direwolf is not yet named when he enters a coma, a result of Jaime pushing him out of a tower. After awaking, however, he names him Summer. Summer dies when White Walkers burst into the Weirwood tree, and his death symbolises Winter truly arriving. Bran is also known as "The Sweet Summer Child", for he has never known Winter and its hardships. Rickon's direwolf, Shaggydog, because Rickon never received a proper education or grooming lessons, and was instead raised by a wildling, Osha. When they seek refuge with House Umber, the Umbers betray them and kill Shaggydog. Likewise, the Umbers are allied with Ramsay Bolton, who is eventually Rickon's killer at the Battle of the Bastards. Jon's direwolf, Ghost, is albino and the runt of the litter, representing a bastard's disadvantage in front of his half-sibilings. The word "ghost" makes us think of the part of a person that lives on, and when Jon is resurrected by Melisandre in Season 6, Ghost is the first being to see him alive. Ghost is white, and Jon Snow is also sometimes called the White Wolf, such as by Wyman Manderly in "[[The Winds of Winter]]."

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Stark was founded by [[Brandon the Builder]], a semi-mythical figure who is credited with building the [[Wall]] and [[Winterfell]], founding the [[Night's Watch]] and ensuring the survival of the people of Westeros after the mythical [[Long Night]] and the [[Age of Heroes|War for the Dawn]] against the enigmatic Others (called "[[White Walkers]]" in the TV series). The family has survived for over 8,000 years and was the independent royal house of the vast territories of the North until King [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] overran the southern half of the continent. By the time the King in the North, [[Torrhen Stark]], had gathered together his widely scattered bannermen, Aegon had already conquered most of the South. Particularly, Aegon had already used his [[dragon]]s to inflict a crushing defeat on both the Westerlands and the Reach at the [[Field of Fire]]. Torrhen Stark finally advanced south to the Riverlands with the amassed armies of the North to a confrontation with Aegon. However, upon seeing Aegon's vast numerical superiority and his dragons, Torrhen Stark realized he had no hope of victory, and chose to bend the knee in submission.

The civil war known as [[Robert's Rebellion]] began when [[Lyanna Stark]] was kidnapped by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]. Lord Rickard Stark and his son and heir Brandon both demanded her return from King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] and were executed by the Mad King for their presumption. Eddard Stark, now the head of the family, called the banners of the North to war, supported by [[House Baratheon]], [[House Tully]] and [[House Arryn]]. It was decided that [[Robert Baratheon]] would claim the throne due to his strong claim as the grand-nephew of a previous Targaryen king. During the civil war Stark troops were instrumental in several engagements, including the Battle of the Bells and the [[Battle of the Trident]], and it was Eddard Stark's forces which reached [[King's Landing]] just after the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] had sacked it, ensuring the city was turned over to Robert's army when it arrived. The Starks also proved instrumental in the later [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], lending troops used by Robert to storm the castle of Pyke and crush the uprising.

In the novels, four of Lord Eddard Stark's six children inherit the Tully look from their mother Catelyn, possessing the auburn hair and blue eyes distinctive of House Tully. However, Arya inherits the Stark look of dark hair, grey eyes, and a long face alongside her half-brother Jon who, as Eddard's illegitimate son with an unidentified woman, does not possess Tully blood. While this has resulted in Arya being mockingly called "Horseface", Ned assures her that she bears a striking resemblance to his beautiful deceased sister Lyanna when Lyanna was a girl. Jon's own inheritance of the traditional Stark look and resemblance to Ned is a plot point illustrating he is of Stark blood and used by characters in-universe to identify Jon as a son of Eddard Stark. As a little girl, Arya once feared that she might be a bastard child because she and Jon are the only two among the Stark children to inherit the Stark look, but Jon assured her that she is a trueborn daughter.

In the novels, the Stark banner is a whole [[direwolf]]. In the TV series, the Stark banner most often used is just a direwolf's head, though the alternate version showing the whole direwolf is also seen (i.e. on banners during the [[Tournament|Tourney of the Hand]], tapestries at Winterfell, and Ned Stark's wax seal on the letter he sends to Stannis Baratheon). Further, the sigil in the books is just a grey direwolf on a white field. This is used in the TV series, but it also frequently uses a subtle variant which has the grey direwolf on a white field, surmounting a small green escutcheon at the bottom.

Many houses sworn to House Stark in the books did not appear in the series.

George R.R. Martin has said that the [[War of the Five Kings]] is inspired by the real-life Wars of the Roses in England (1455-1485). As such, House Stark is based on the House of York with specific members having some similarities with them such as [[Sansa Stark]] for Elizabeth of York and [[Robb Stark]] for King Edward IV.
