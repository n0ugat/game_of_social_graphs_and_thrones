The '''Kingsguard'''{{Ref|GOT108}} or '''Queensguard''',{{Con|ASOIAF}} in cases of a ruling female monarch, is an elite sworn brotherhood of seven [[Knighthood|knights]], reputably the greatest and most skilled warriors in all of [[Westeros]], who serve as the royal guard of the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]]. Their duty is to protect the king and the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|royal family]] from harm at all times. The Kingsguard swear the holiest of vows to fulfill their sacred duty, and—in theory—are meant to be the living exemplars of the pinnacle of knightly values. Members of the Kingsguard serve for life and are forbidden from owning land, taking wives, or fathering children. The Kingsguard wear signature all-white cloaks and fine silver armor.

The [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]], currently Ser [[Criston Cole]], sits on the king's [[Small Council]] as [[Hand of the King]].

Since the [[coup in King's Landing]] at the beginning of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], the Kingsguard has splintered between two claimants to the throne. Some knights of the Kingsguard at the time of [[Viserys I Targaryen]]'s death have chosen to follow King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] and the [[Greens]], while others have chosen to become part of the Queensguard of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], believing the [[Blacks]] to have the true claim to the [[Iron Throne]].

==Background==
[[File:Attempt of Assassination of Aegon I.png|thumb|Assassination attempt on Aegon I.|left]]
The Kingsguard was founded during the reign of the first Targaryen king on the [[Iron Throne]], Aegon the Conqueror in 10 AC. During the [[First Dornish War]], Aegon and Visenya placed bounties on the heads of Dornish lords, who, in turn, placed bounties on the Targaryens and their allies. Half a dozen Dornish lords were successfully assassinated, though only two of their killers ever lived to collect their bounties. [[File:Visenya slashes Aegon by Jota Saraiva.jpg|thumb|[[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] proves her brothers guard were useless.]]King Aegon was attacked on three occasions, and Visenya was attacked on several occasions as well. One day, when Aegon and Visenya were assaulted on the streets of King's Landing, only Visenya's swift intervention saved Aegon's life. The first Kingsguard was created at the suggestion of Aegon's sister-wife, Queen Visenya Targaryen. When Aegon argued that his guards were still sufficient for his protection, Visenya drew [[Dark Sister]]. Before his guards could react, she had cut Aegon's cheek, pointing out to him that his guards were slow and lazy. She deliberately modelled the Kingsguard vows of holding no lands or title on the ancient vows of the [[Night's Watch]], and seven knights were chosen because the king ruled the Seven Kingdoms.

==In the books==
{{Main|Kingsguard#In the books}}
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the Kingsguard wear shining white armor.

The Kingsguard under [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys I]] consisted of the following:
*Ser [[Criston Cole]]
*Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]] 
*Ser [[Rickard Thorne]]
*Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]]
*Ser [[Willis Fell]]
*Ser [[Erryk Cargyll]]
*Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]]
In 129 AC, at [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]'s death, [[Steffon Darklyn]] and [[Lorent Marbrand]] were in [[Dragonstone]] with [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], and remained loyal to her. Following [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]]'s coronation, [[Erryk Cargyll]] defected and joined [[Blacks|Rhaenyra's loyalists]]. The other four Kingsguard remained loyal to Aegon.
