==Narration==
'''Ygritte''': ''"Swords in the darkness." Aye. The black brothers of the Night's Watch are that at least, as too many of the Free Folk know.''

''You [[Southerner|southerners]] are strange. A man murders and you [[Knighthood|train him]] to kill better. A man thieves or rapes and you send him where it's dark and private.''

''Well, at least you make him promise to be good and then you make him regret even that.''

''From the time he's woken to the time he's allowed to sleep, he walks the frozen wall, carries frozen stones, or boils frozen food. When he lies down at night, he can't have anybody to warm his frozen bed.''

''Well, not unless the crows like to "nest" together.''

''You think he remembers the stories they told him then? About when the [[White Walkers]] [[Long Night|woke]] in the [[Land of Always Winter]] and how the [[Wall]] and the [[Night's Watch]] were raised to stop them the next time? Never mind trapping us on the other side?''

''We Free Folk have our stories, too. About how one of your [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|king crows]] found something cold in the woods with bright blue eyes. How he brought her home, through your wall, and declared himself "[[Night's King]]."''

''For thirteen years, he and his [[Corpse queen|queen]] ruled over his brothers, making sacrifices as black as their cloaks. Lucky for you southerners, the Free Folk rallied to a [[Joramun|King-Beyond-the-Wall]], as we will when need be, and marched on the ancient castle he had taken as his own, the [[Nightfort]].''

''With the help of the [[House Stark|Starks]], we killed the demon and cleansed your precious watch. And then they thanked us and kicked us back across the Wall. As you always have.''

''[[Gendel]], [[Raymun Redbeard]], the [[Horned Lord]]. Each chosen as a [[King-Beyond-the-Wall|king-beyond-the-wall]], each promising victory. And all fallen to the Night's Watch and the Starks.''

''But this time it's different. [[Mance Rayder|Our new king]] knows your tricks. You called him a brother crow once, but you never forgot his wings.''

''We know how you think. We know where you're weak. Watch for us from your Wall if you like. With the cold, you won't even feel the blade slip into your back.''
