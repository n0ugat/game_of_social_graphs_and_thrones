[[File:2x3 Ulf Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Ulf boasts about his heritage with a merchant.]]
[[Ulf]], [[Cley]], and [[Mujja]] are drinking at the Cock Inn while Ulf regales a [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] merchant with tales of his purported royal parentage. [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] then arrives and buys drinks for everyone present.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

After Ulf is served a thin broth by [[Dyana]], with the only other option being fish, [[Sylvi]] spreads false rumors about [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] overindulging himself and the royal court with feasts.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Cley and Mujja urge Ulf on to go to [[Dragonstone]] and claim a [[dragon]] during the [[Red Sowing]], not willing to accept that Ulf has been accepting free drinks from the other patrons for a fiction.{{Ref|HOTD207}}
