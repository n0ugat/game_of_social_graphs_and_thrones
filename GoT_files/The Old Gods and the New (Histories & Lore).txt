==Narration==
'''Catelyn Stark''': ''In the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]], the dominant religion is the [[Faith of the Seven]], first brought to its shores by the [[Andals]] some six thousand years ago.''

'''Bran Stark''': ''But there are some who still keep to the old way, worshiping the faceless gods of the [[Children of the Forest]] and the [[First Men]]. The [[Old Gods]] are countless, nameless spirits of nature. In ancient times, the Children of the Forest carved faces in the trunks of the [[weirwood]] trees, which became sacred symbols of their faith. In time, the First Men adopted the Children's gods as their own. Most castles at that time contained a [[godswood]] with a weirwood or a [[heart tree]] at its center.''

'''Catelyn Stark''': ''Meanwhile, across the [[Narrow Sea]], a new religion was born in the [[Andalos|Hills of Andalos]]. According to legend, the [[Seven|God of Seven]] revealed itself to the Andals, and the [[Coming of the Andals|invasion]] of Westeros followed soon after.''

''The Andals sailed across the sea on ships, armed with weapons of steel. Some warriors carved a seven-pointed star into their skin as a symbol of their new faith.''

'''Bran Stark''': ''The invaders destroyed most of the weirwoods in the southern land, slaughtered the Children of the Forest wherever they could find them, and conquered every kingdom of the First Men, save the [[North]]. In time, the Faith of the Seven spread like wildfire throughout the land.''

''The [[Seven]] is a single deity with seven aspects, each symbolizing a different area of life, though most people refer to the Seven as separate gods.''

'''Catelyn Stark''': ''The [[Mother]] is prayed to for mercy and watches over fertility, childbirth, and peace. The [[Father]] sits in judgment over souls. The [[Warrior]] is prayed to for protection, valor, and skill in battle.''

''The [[Crone]] is the symbol of wisdom and foresight. The [[Smith]] watches over creation and craftsmanship. The [[Maiden]] symbolizes purity, love, and beauty.''

''Finally, there is the [[Stranger]], rarely prayed to, who represents death.''

''The Faith is highly organized and deeply influential in Westerosi politics and culture, as the official religion of the [[Iron Throne|monarchy]]. Worshipers gather in temples of the Faith called [[sept]]s.''

''The seat of the Faith is the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], which is located in the capital city of [[King's Landing baker|King's Landing]].''

'''Bran Stark''': ''Still, in the North, where [[Northmen|descendants]] of the First Men dwell, worship of the Old Gods continues to this day, and the sacred faces of the weirwood trees keep close watch over the faithful.''
