'''Gods Eye'''{{Ref|GOT110}} is an immense lake, the largest inland body of water in [[Westeros]]. It is located in the heart of the continent, in the southeast of the [[Riverlands]]. Small fishing villages dot its shores, but the most significant settlement is the ill-omened castle of [[Harrenhal]], located on the north shore.

Gods Eye feeds a river which is a tributary of the [[Blackwater Rush]]. The [[Isle of Faces]] is located within Gods Eye.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that following the destruction of the western Lannister army-group in the Riverlands at the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]], the eastern Lannister army led by Tywin himself will fall back from the location of the [[battle on the Green Fork]] and regroup at Harrenhal, on the north shore of Gods Eye lake. Tywin specifically says that to cover the retreat of the main army, he is sending out [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] and his riders to set fire to the farms and fields of the Riverlands everywhere between the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]] river and Gods Eye lake.{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Yoren]]'s caravan arrives at the Gods Eye and takes shelter in a holdfast. A Lannister force led by [[Amory Lorch]] encounters them, and a [[Fight at the holdfast|fight]] breaks, resulting in a Lannister victory.{{Ref|GOT203}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Isle of Faces is reputed to be located in the center of Gods Eye, the home of "greenseers" who keep the traditions and secrets of the long-vanished [[Children of the Forest]]. The island is said to be home to many [[weirwood]] trees. The Isle has a fell reputation and most avoid it.

Gods Eye feeds a tributary of the Blackwater Rush, but does not appear to be navigable by large ships. Another river, the Rippledown Rill, also feeds the lake.
