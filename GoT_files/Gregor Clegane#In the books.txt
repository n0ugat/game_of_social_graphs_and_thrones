Ser '''Gregor Clegane''', popularly known as the '''Mountain That Rides''' or simply the '''Mountain''', was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Clegane]] in service to [[House Lannister]], the older brother of [[Sandor Clegane]], and a notoriously fearsome, extremely lethal, and much-feared warrior, with a tendency toward extreme and excessive violence.

==Biography==
===Background===
Ser Gregor Clegane was the head of [[House Clegane]], a knightly house from the [[Westerlands]], and the elder brother of [[Sandor Clegane]]. When Sandor and Gregor were children, Gregor held his brother's face in a fire for playing with one of his toys without permission, horrifically scarring him.{{Ref|GOT104}} Gregor was a landed knight rather than a full-fledged lord. Gregor was monstrously huge, he was the largest, strongest, and most feared man in [[Westeros]]. His monstrous strength and size were unmatched, and he was one of the most powerful and dangerous people in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. He was feared throughout [[Westeros]] with a reputation for ferocity, brutality, and anger. He has committed unspeakable acts of violence, such as brutally torturing his victims to death, viciously raping women, and murdering children. He was a fiercely loyal retainer and servant of [[House Lannister]], particularly to Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]].<ref name="Gregor viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/lannister/gregor-clegane/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Lannister - Gregor Clegane entry]</ref>

[[File:Knighting.png|thumb|At the request of Tywin Lannister, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen anoints Gregor as a knight.]]
Numerous servants have gone missing at the Clegane keep over the years, apparently killed by Gregor for minor slights in one of his infamous fits of rage, and their deaths then covered up. Gregor's own father and sister died under dubious circumstances as well, and Sandor thinks that Gregor may have killed them too. Their sister died when Sandor was too young to remember her well, and their father died years later in what was said to be a "hunting accident." At the request of Tywin, [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] himself anointed Gregor as a knight, a great honor, even though Gregor was an infamously dishonorable man.{{Ref|H&L210}}

[[File:Slaughter.png|thumb|Gregor about to murder Rhaegar's family.]]
During [[Robert's Rebellion]], one year after Prince Rhaegar knighted him, Gregor participated in the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. After entering the Red Keep, he brutally killed Rhaegar's two children by [[Elia Martell]]: their daughter [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]] and baby [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon]]. He killed baby Aegon by bashing his head against the wall, and then while still covered in the gore from her children, proceeded to viciously torture and rape Elia. After torturing and raping her for several hours, he then horrifically killed her. It is rumored that he killed her by cutting her in half with a single swing of his massive sword,<ref name="Elia viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/elia-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Elia Targaryen entry]</ref><ref name="Gregor viewers guide" /> although he later claimed to have "smashed her head in with his bare hands."{{Ref|GOT408}}

Despite pleas by Ned Stark, neither Gregor nor Tywin were punished by King Robert for the murders of the royal family, leading to a rift in Ned and Robert's friendship.{{Ref|H&L117}}{{Ref|H&L118}}{{Ref|H&L210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Gregor Clegane in armor.png|thumb|Gregor participates in the Hand's tourney.]]
Ser Gregor takes part in the [[tournament]] to celebrate [[Eddard Stark]]'s appointment as [[Hand of the King]]. He kills Ser [[Hugh of the Vale]] in a joust, horrifying the crowd. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] tells [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] that Gregor burned his brother [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor]]'s face over a naked flame when they were boys because Sandor borrowed one of his toys without asking. He tells her that few people know the story and not to let Sandor know that she does.{{Ref|GOT104}}

[[File:Sandor, Gregor & Loras 1x05.jpg|thumb|Gregor stands defiantly after Robert ends his showdown with Sandor.]]
When Gregor faces Ser [[Loras Tyrell]], he loses the joust; Loras chose to ride a mare in heat to distract Gregor's stallion. Flying into a rage, Gregor demands his sword, then ruthlessly decapitates his erstwhile mount before the entire horrified crowd. Ignoring his surroundings, he proceeds to knock the surprised Loras off his horse and is on the verge of dishonorably killing him, when his brother Sandor intervenes, fighting him off to protect Loras. The two brothers violently trade swings with their swords, and Gregor only stops when King Robert himself shouts to stop the fight, at which time the enraged Gregor reluctantly relents, throws his sword down in disgust, and leaves.{{Ref|GOT105}}

Catelyn takes [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] into custody, on suspicion of the attempted assassination of her son [[Bran Stark|Bran]].{{Ref|GOT104}} In response, Gregor is dispatched to raid the [[Riverlands]], her homeland. Refugees from the Riverlands attend court in King's Landing and report that a huge knight who could take the head of a horse off in one blow led the attack and had sacked their villages. Littlefinger asks Eddard: "Remind you of someone?" Eddard sends [[Beric Dondarrion]] with a hundred men to bring Gregor to justice. Eddard [[Attainder|declares him]] a false knight and strips him of all ranks and titles, lands and holdings, and sentences him to death.{{Ref|GOT106}} The ruling was made null by Eddard's arrest for treason and subsequent beheading.{{Ref|GOT109}}

The host led by Beric [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford|clashes]] against Gregor at the [[Mummer's Ford]]. Gregor is victorious, and Beric is reported dead.{{Ref|GOT304}}<ref>Season 2 Bluray: War of the Five Kings feature</ref>

However, when [[Robb Stark]]'s [[Battle of Whispering Wood|victory]] against [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] necessitates Tywin's withdrawal of his forces to [[Harrenhal]], he orders Gregor to take five hundred men and "set the Riverlands on fire" from the [[Gods Eye]] to the [[Red Fork]].{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[File:Gregor Viewer's Guide.jpg|thumb|Gregor commands the torture at Harrenhal.]]
Gregor continues to raid the villages of the Riverlands from the Lannister army's base at [[Harrenhal]]. His men torture the prisoners they take for information about [[Brotherhood Without Banners|the Brotherhood]] and hidden valuables. He selects the prisoners for torture personally. Ser [[Amory Lorch]] adds a group of captured [[Night's Watch]] recruits to the captives. Tywin arrives during the torture and asks Gregor what is going on. Gregor says that they were not expecting Tywin for another day. Tywin asks why the prisoners are not in their cells. Gregor says that their cells are overflowing. [[Polliver|One of Lorch's men]] interjects that the prisoners will not be there long.{{Ref|GOT204}}

Tywin asks if they are so well manned that they can afford to discard able and skilled prisoners. He asks a [[Gendry Baratheon|prisoner]] if he has a trade and learns that he is a smith. Tywin orders the prisoners put to work, sparing the young man.{{Ref|GOT204}}

When the [[Ironborn]] under the command of [[Theon Greyjoy]] [[Fight at Torrhen's Square|attack Torrhen’s Square]] to lure the remaining Stark forces away from [[Winterfell]], Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] assumes that it could be a raiding party led by the Mountain or sellswords paid by Tywin.{{Ref|GOT205}}

[[File:Tywin_and_Gregor.jpg|thumb|Gregor with Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal.]]
Following the assassination of Ser Amory just outside Tywin's chamber, Gregor is tasked with finding the culprit. Tywin fears that he was the intended target and has Ser Gregor hang over 30 of their own men. Gregor suggests an infiltrator from the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] was responsible and Tywin dispatches him to pressure the [[smallfolk]] of the [[Riverlands]] into giving up the members of the Brotherhood.{{Ref|GOT207}} Tywin marches back to the Westerlands and leaves Gregor to serve as castellan at Harrenhal.{{Ref|GOT208}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Robb and his army get to Harrenhal, finding that Gregor has left the castle with his men. To their horror, they discover that Gregor has executed the remaining 200 Northmen and Rivermen prisoners at Harrenhal, leaving their bodies to rot.{{Ref|GOT301}}

Gregor is later [[Battle of the Fords|expelled]] from [[Stone Mill]] by a force led by Robb's uncle, [[Edmure Tully]], forcing him to flee south to [[Casterly Rock]]. However, Robb chides his uncle for his actions, explaining that he wanted to draw the Mountain into the west where they could kill him.{{Ref|GOT303}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Oberyn Martell discusses with Tyrion how the last time he was in King's Landing, it was for the wedding of his sister Elia to Rhaegar. He also states that during the Sack of King's Landing, his sister was raped and murdered by Gregor. Oberyn believes that Tyrion's father, Tywin, was the one to give the order to the Mountain. He told Tyrion that he intended to avenge her.
Polliver tells Gregor's brother Sandor when meeting in a tavern further north, that while loyal to the Mountain and the Lannisters, Polliver wasn't in agreement with Gregor's torturous methods because they were repetitive and boring.{{Ref|GOT401}}

[[File:TheMountainMockingbird.jpg|thumb|Clegane is called upon to fight by Cersei Lannister.]]
When Tyrion demands a [[trial by combat]], Gregor is quickly appointed the Crown's champion by Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] in order to deter anyone from fighting for Tyrion. Gregor is seen slaughtering prisoners and Cersei compliments him on his form, agreeing that it doesn't matter who faces him. Tyrion first asks his brother Jaime to fight for him, but he declines, saying that he simply cannot fight like he used to with the loss of his sword hand. Tyrion then asks his friend [[Bronn]] to be his champion, but he too refuses, arguing that the Mountain is an incredibly dangerous fighter, one that would cost him his life if he makes a single mistake. Finally, Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] approaches Tyrion and volunteers to be his champion, as he wants to avenge his sister.{{Ref|GOT407}}

[[File:Mountain and viper ep.jpg|thumb|The Mountain battles Oberyn to the death.]]
Gregor fights Oberyn at Tyrion's trial by combat, clad in a heavy plated armor and wielding a large broad sword in one hand. Despite his immense size and strength, Gregor is no match for Oberyn's swift and agile fighting style. Oberyn manages to knock Gregor's helmet off early into the duel and proceeds ​to slowly cut him down, all the while taunting him and demanding he admit to the rape and murder of Elia Martell and her children, chanting ever more loudly "you raped her; you murdered her; you killed her children."{{Ref|GOT408}}

[[File:Mountain and viper fight.jpg|thumb|Oberyn gains the upper hand over Gregor.]]
Oberyn eventually severs ​Clegane's hamstring, bringing the giant to his knees. Oberyn presses his advantage by jumping and thrusting his spear into Gregor's chest, severely injuring the gigantic man and seemingly sealing his defeat. Thinking his opponent is fully incapacitated, Oberyn removes his spear from Gregor's chest and circles him, refusing to land a killing blow until Gregor admits that he killed Elia and reveals who orchestrated it, directing his gaze accusingly at Tywin. However, in his hubris, Oberyn is unexpectedly caught off guard while standing too close to his opponent. Gregor trips Oberyn, spilling him to the ground, seizes him by the neck and slams his fist squarely into his face, instantly knocking out several of his teeth.{{Ref|GOT408}}

[[File:Game-Of-Thrones-Oberyns-crushed-head-and-wounded-Mountain.jpg|thumb|The Mountain crushes Oberyn's skull with his bare hands.]]
Berserk with fury at nearly being killed by his opponent, Gregor pins Oberyn to the ground and proceeds to gouge out his eyeballs, making him scream in agony, as he roars for all to hear: "Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her! Then I smashed her head... in like this!." He then crushes Oberyn's skull, making his paramour [[Ellaria Sand]] scream in horror. Gregor collapses beside his fallen opponent from the wounds he sustained as Tywin announces that, according to the rules of trial by combat, Oberyn's death has officially sealed the fate of Tyrion and sentences him to death.{{Ref|GOT408}}

[[File:Pycelle in gregor examining.png|thumb|Gregor's injuries are examined.]]
Despite his exceedingly gruesome death, Oberyn nonetheless extracts a measure of posthumous revenge. Before the duel, Oberyn had his spearheads coated with [[manticore]] venom, one of the deadliest [[Poison|poisons]] in the known world. Gregor's wounds rapidly start putrefying, emitting an overpowering stench. As a final torture, the venom forces him to remain conscious through the whole ordeal, even as his flesh dies and peels off his body. [[Pycelle]] regretfully tells Cersei that Gregor is beyond any hope of healing.{{Ref|GOT410}}

[[File:Gregor and qyburn.jpg|thumb|Qyburn decides to experiment on Gregor.]]
[[Qyburn]], however, an expelled former maester with extensive medical knowledge gained from "repugnant" and "unnatural" experimentation on living people, suggests that he may be able to save him. Pycelle objects, citing Qyburn's disreputable dismissal from the Order of Maesters. Cersei dismisses Pycelle and gives Qyburn permission to do anything he can to save Ser Gregor (likely out of gratitude for sealing her brother's fate 'revenge' for the death of Joffrey), though Qyburn says that his unorthodox methods may "change" him. She nervously asks if he means the process will weaken Gregor, but Qyburn knowingly assures her it will not.{{Ref|GOT410}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
A moribund Gregor Clegane remains in [[Qyburn]]'s laboratory in the dungeons below the Red Keep as the experiments continue.{{Ref|GOT502}} Cersei visits Qyburn and asks him about the state of his work, while glancing at Gregor's covered body, and Qyburn assures her it is going very well, though there is still a way to go. Then, Gregor suddenly spasms, and Qyburn gently shushes him and tells him to go easy.{{Ref|GOT503}} During Cersei's imprisonment by the Faith, Qyburn reminds her that ''"the work continues."''{{Ref|GOT508}}

[[File:Mountainstein.png|thumb|A transformed Ser Gregor carries Cersei into the Red Keep.]]
After Cersei's [[walk of atonement]], she returns to the Keep where Qyburn covers her up and is pleased to introduce the "newest member" of the Kingsguard. The Mountain stands as tall as ever, fully covered in Kingsguard plate armor. Only his reddened eyes, surrounded by pale bluish flesh, are visible through his helmet. With Cersei's feet injured and bleeding, he is instructed to carry her. As he does so, Qyburn informs Cersei that Clegane has taken a holy vow of silence to last until all of Tommen's enemies are dead and the evil has been driven from the realm.{{Ref|GOT510}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:Home 09.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Gregor begins to persecute anyone who goes against Cersei.]]
Gregor is present standing guard over Cersei when Jaime returns from [[Dorne]] with [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]'s body.{{Ref|GOT601}} Later, Gregor continues to serve Cersei without question. He finds a [[King's Landing boaster|man who boasts of having flashed his penis]] at Cersei during her walk and bashes his head against a wall, killing him.{{Ref|GOT602}}

[[File:Oathbreaker 16.jpg|thumb|Cersei reveals her plan to use Gregor.]]
Back at the Red Keep, he accompanies Cersei when she attempts to attend Myrcella's funeral, only to be stopped by a group of Lannister soldiers, who have arrived to prevent her from leaving on King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]'s orders. Although Gregor intimidates the [[Lannister captain|captain]] with his size, Cersei acquiesces, and he escorts her back to her room.{{Ref|GOT602}}

Gregor follows Cersei and Jaime into Qyburn's laboratory, where the former Maester tries to win the service of the [[little birds]] by offering them candied plums from Dorne; the children are extremely frightened by the towering knight and quickly flee the room. Jaime asks what Qyburn has done to Gregor, to which the latter replies with "a number of things." Jaime wonders whether Gregor is able to understand what they are saying, then insults his intelligence by questioning whether he ever understood complete sentences at all, to which the huge knight menacingly turns his head towards Jaime. Qyburn assures that Gregor understands well enough. Jaime suggested sending Ser Gregor to the High Septon to crush him and his Faith Militants. Cersei disagrees, saying they can't let Ser Gregor face them all and that he only needs to face one, implying the coming trial by combat.{{Ref|GOT603}}

[[File:Oathbreaker 22.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Gregor acts as Cersei's protector when she intervenes the Small Council. ]]
At the Small Council, Pycelle expresses his disgusts about Qyburn's treatment of Ser Gregor, calling him an abomination. He attempts to suggest that it would be in everyone's best interest to have the "beast" destroyed, but he was cut short when he becomes aware of the presence of Cersei, Jaime and Gregor himself. Frightened by the huge man, Pycelle cannot keep himself from passing gas. Cersei suggests the Small Council gets on with urgent matters, as they cannot make them leave. Kevan replies that Cersei and Jaime cannot make them stay either, unless they set Gregor to kill them. As everyone except Cersei and Jaime leave, Pycelle cowers past Ser Gregor, who coldly looks back.{{Ref|GOT603}}

[[File:The Broken Man 01.jpg|thumb|Gregor guards Cersei during her conversation with Olenna.]]
After Cersei gets word of Olenna Tyrell's intention to return to Highgarden, she confronts her. Ser Gregor Clegane follows in the Queen Mother's wake and silently stands guard behind her.{{Ref|GOT607}} When Lancel and several other members of the Faith Militant enter the Red Keep, Cersei, Qyburn, and Ser Gregor arrive to confront them. Lancel tells Cersei that the High Septon wishes to speak with her, but Cersei refuses, and when Lancel does not leave at her command, Gregor stands in his way as the Faith attempt to forcibly take Cersei.{{Ref|GOT608}}

[[File:Mountain kills No One Ep.jpg|thumb|Ser Gregor easily kills a member of the Faith Militant.]]
He remains unmoved when Lancel orders him to stand down. One of the Sparrows attacked Gregor, and although his weapon's spikes pierce Gregor's plate, Gregor does not say a word or appear to even acknowledge any injury. When the Sparrow tries to attack again, Gregor grabs him by the throat, lifting him into the air and throwing him to the ground. While Lancel and the other Sparrows look on in horror, the towering knight kneels beside him and tears his head off. Lancel and the others thereby stand down.{{Ref|GOT608}}

[[File:Gregor Cersei Qyburn.jpg|thumb|Gregor stands by Cersei as her plan to use him in a trial by combat crumbles.]]
Ser Gregor accompanies Cersei and Qyburn to the [[throne room]], where Tommen is about to make a royal announcement. As Cersei attempts to stand besides her son, she is barred by Kevan Lannister, who tells her place is on the gallery with the other ladies of the court. Cersei reluctantly takes her place there with Gregor following her, causing the women to hastily make place. Tommen announces that Cersei and Loras will stand trial before seven septons and that trial by combat is forbidden in the Seven Kingdoms, thereby nullifying Cersei's plans on having the Mountain fight as her champion again.{{Ref|GOT608}}

On the day of her and [[Loras Tyrell]]'s trial, Cersei sends Gregor to Tommen's chambers, to prevent him from going to the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] to protect him from its destruction. Tommen tries to get past but Gregor easily holds him back. Tommen later commits suicide after hearing of [[Margaery Tyrell]]'s death in the [[destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]].{{Ref|GOT610}}

[[File:Here-he-lightly-lightened.JPG|thumb|Ser Gregor prepares to torture Septa Unella.]]
Gregor is summoned by Cersei to the [[Red Keep]] dungeons after the explosion, being introduced to Cersei's newest prisoner, Septa [[Unella]]. After removing his helmet, revealing his withered and mangled face, Gregor is left alone with Unella, who screams in terror as the Mountain looms over her, ready to carry out his orders to torture the Septa for imprisoning and humiliating Cersei. Later, when Cersei is crowned as queen, he is seen looming beside the Iron Throne, gazing into the crowd.{{Ref|GOT610}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[file:Gregor Clegane Season 7.jpg|thumb|307x307px|Gregor defends Cersei.]]
Gregor is present when Cersei holds court, and moves to protect his queen when [[Euron Greyjoy]] steps too close to the throne.{{Ref|GOT701}}

He is also present when Cersei holds court to the nobility of the [[Reach]].{{Ref|GOT702}}

Gregor is also present when Cersei hosts a grand reception with Lord Euron and his prisoners [[Yara Greyjoy]], Ellaria, and [[Tyene Sand]]. He was later present in the dungeons with Qyburn when Cersei confronts her prisoners Ellaria and Tyene over the murder of her daughter. While Cersei had toyed with ordering Gregor to smash their heads like he did with Oberyn, she instead settles for poisoning Tyene with the [[long farewell]] and forcing Ellaria to watch her daughter's final death throes.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:CerseisGroupArrives.png|thumb|180x180px|Cersei and her followers arrive at the Dragonpit.]]
When [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and her retainers are set to arrive in King's Landing to negotiate an [[Dragonpit Summit|armistice]] with Cersei and her royal army, Cersei has Clegane stand in as her personal bodyguard. Even before they set out to the [[Dragonpit]], where the meeting is stated to be held, she makes preparations with Qyburn, Jaime and Clegane. She orders Ser Gregor to first kill Daenerys, then Tyrion, then Jon, and the rest of them in any order if the meeting goes wrong. Together with Clegane, Cersei then sets out to meet their guests. When their procession arrives in the Dragonpit, Sandor Clegane—who is with the group of Daenerys—is shocked to see the state of his hated brother.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:Cleganes_finale_ep7.jpg|270x270px|thumb|Gregor is confronted by his brother.]]
Once Gregor has taken his place behind Cersei, Sandor approaches him. Sandor hatefully states that Gregor was now uglier than Sandor and that this was not how it would end for Gregor. Sandor continues, claiming Gregor knew that Sandor will be coming for him, before returning to his group. Accordingly, Gregor steps back behind Cersei, only to emerge once more when Daenerys arrives on the dragon [[Drogon]].{{Ref|GOT707}}

When Euron Greyjoy takes too many liberties during the parley, threatening the fragile peace, Cersei orders him to sit down or leave. Clegane threateningly steps forward to further stress her point. During the parley, Daenerys's group releases a [[Captured wight|wight]] to prove the threat the undead pose. Clegane was ready to shield Cersei from the wight, but Sandor yanks it back with a chain. When Jon Snow later reveals to Cersei that he already swore allegiance to Daenerys, Cersei calls off the parley and returns to the Red Keep with her retainers, Clegane included. To convince her to accept the armistice, Tyrion follows her and is escorted to her chambers by Clegane, who visibly makes Tyrion uneasy. Clegane escorts Tyrion into the room and remains in the back while Cersei and Tyrion argue and discuss.{{Ref|GOT707}}

He is ready to execute Tyrion when the dwarf demands he do so, but Cersei never gives the order. Instead, Tyrion actually manages to convince Cersei to come to the Dragonpit again and, accompanied by Clegane and the others, Cersei turns up once more to announce that she will send her armies north to assist in fighting the dead. This, however, is a lie and Cersei has no intention of doing so.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:JaimeThreatenedByClegane.png|thumb|180x180px|Jaime realizes that his life is threatened by Clegane.]]
The group returns to the Red Keep. When Jaime made it clear to Cersei that he would join the fight against the army of the dead with or without her, Clegane suddenly prevents him from leaving the room. Cersei calls Jaime a traitor for disobeying her commands and stating that no one walks away from her. When Cersei nods, Clegane draws his sword, waiting for Cersei to give the order to execute Jaime. However, Jaime called Cersei out on her bluff and walks right past Clegane, who does not intervene, and out of the room.{{Ref|GOT707}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
[[File:Cersei Gates S8 EP4.jpg|thumb|Gregor carries out his duty in Missandei's execution.]]
Gregor is present when Euron and Captain [[Harry Strickland]] announce the arrival of the [[Golden Company]] to Cersei. Afterwards, Euron makes another move on Cersei, but Clegane stops him from proceeding with a menacing stare. Nevertheless, when the queen finally allows Euron to have his way with her, Clegane does not intervene.{{Ref|GOT801}} During the [[parley]] outside the gates of King's Landing, Gregor carries out Cersei's order of executing [[Missandei]].{{Ref|GOT804}}

[[File:GREGORGRABSSANDORBELLS.jpeg|thumb|Gregor kills Qyburn.]]
During the [[Battle of King's Landing]], Gregor stays by Cersei's side to guard her. As Daenerys intensifies Drogon's fiery assault on the Red Keep, Qyburn convinces Cersei to flee her tower while Gregor protects them both from the falling debris. On the stairs they are confronted by Sandor who slays all the surviving Kingsguard except Gregor who remains at Cersei's side. Gregor wishes to fight Sandor but Cersei and Qyburn order him to guard her. In anger, he bashes in Qyburn's skull while Cersei flees past both of the brothers.{{Ref|GOT805}}

[[File:Clegane Battle S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Sandor confronts Gregor.]]
In the ensuing duel, Sandor proves himself better at sword fighting than Gregor and stabs him, but fails to kill the creature. Gregor brutally thrashes and chokes Sandor who stabs him many times in vain. While trying to crush Sandor’s skull, Gregor is stabbed through his left eye, though even this fails to kill him and Gregor begins to pull the blade out. Seeing an opportunity, Sandor tackles Gregor into a crumbling wall, sending them both falling from the Red Keep tower to their deaths in the burning city below.{{Ref|GOT805}}

{{Quote|I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad dog without a single strategic thought in his head.|Robb Stark aptly describes the Mountain.|Walk of Punishment (episode)}}
Gregor is notorious for his brutal and savage nature, remorselessly killing unarmed opponents half his size or leading the torture of helpless villagers. Often referred to as "Tywin Lannister's mad dog", Gregor has an insatiable bloodlust that he releases through acts of extreme violence. He is quick to anger and never shows any fear of acting on it, since there are not many who would dare try to stop him. One of the few people he has ever shown any loyalty or respect toward are Lord Tywin Lannister and King Robert Baratheon.

Gregor's short fuse and utter lack of a conscience often showed his lack of honor. In addition, he does not appear to be very bright, relying on brute force to get the job done without thinking of the long-term consequences.

As a warrior, Gregor is widely feared for his terrifying and gigantic size and superhuman strength. He is a giant of a man, standing well over seven feet in height (eight feet in the novels) and weighing over 500 pounds. In combat, his immense strength and beastly size gives him a huge advantage over almost any opponent, allowing him to defeat men who have far more skill. His weapon of choice is an enormous greatsword that most men would never be able to swing with even two hands, but which Gregor is strong enough to wield one-handed. Gregor also wears thick armor too heavy for most knights to move in, let alone fight in, providing him almost impenetrable defense against blades. 

Following his treatment by Qyburn, the Mountain is no longer capable of speech, but the process has made him even stronger than he once was. His grotesque, deathly appearance is usually hidden beneath his armor. He is now totally obedient to his mistress, the queen and heeds her every whim without question.

==Behind the scenes==
*Gregor Clegane is the only character in the entire series who has been portrayed by more than two actors in different seasons. He was initially played by [[Conan Stevens]]. The second actor, [[Ian Whyte]], was originally to continue portraying the character after the second season, but was instead cast as [[Dongo]] and later [[Wun Weg Wun Dar Wun]]. Whyte's replacement, [[Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson]], is actually nineteen years younger than [[Rory McCann]], who portrays Gregor's younger brother [[Sandor Clegane]].
*[[Michael Homick]] was a stunt double for [[Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson]] in the role of Gregor Clegane.

==In the books==
[[File:Roman Papsuev - Gregor Clegane.png|thumb|300px|right|Gregor Clegane by Roman "Amok" Papsuev.©]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Gregor Clegane is a savage brute of a man, freakishly tall at nearly 8 feet in height, and well over 30 stone in weight (420 lbs./190 kg), most of it muscle. Gregor is so strong that he can easily wield with one hand greatswords which are meant to be wielded with two hands, allowing him to carry a shield as well. He is so strong that he has been known to cleave men in two with a single blow of his sword.

Known as "the Mountain That Rides", Gregor is one of Tywin Lannister's chief enforcers. Gregor's knighthood is regarded as a hypocritical mockery of justice by many, as he is a thoroughly dishonorable and undisciplined butcher. While Gregor is so strong that he can easily fight the strongest knights in Westeros, his greatest enthusiasm in wartime is for burning out the homes of peasants who cannot possibly fight back, and torturing their women and children to death. Indeed, Gregor's immense size isn't really his main attribute to Tywin, so much as his utter enthusiasm for committing atrocities. With a "might makes right" mentality, Gregor feels that his immense bulk and strength gives him impunity to behave as he does, as few would dare to challenge him. While Gregor is incredibly dangerous in combat, he relies more on sheer strength than on speed or skill. Gregor has gone through two wives, who died from the extremely rough treatment they received from him, though there are rumors that he killed them on purpose. His father and younger sister also died on suspicious circumstances. [[Sandor Clegane]] left when Gregor succeeded their father and never returned.

Gregor has a nearly uncontrollable temper, and is capable of very brutal violence for the slightest provocation. According to Sandor, he once killed one of his men for snoring. When he was in Harrenhal, a servant girl named Pia spoke when he wanted silence, so he smashed her face in with his mailed fist, breaking her nose and many of her teeth. According to his squire, Gregor frequently suffers extremely severe headaches, and drinks milk of the poppy as other men would quaff ale to treat them. This has had the unfortunate effect of rendering milk of the poppy less effective as a painkiller to treat Gregor for other injuries, as Pycelle discovers while trying to treat the poisoned spear wounds Oberyn Martell inflicted on him; Gregor is left screaming in agony from his injuries night and day, with milk of the poppy providing him no relief.{{Bookref|ASOS|72}}

Gregor's men-at-arms are known as "the Mountain's men." His cruelty and brutality are clearly mirrored in them. The best thing that can be said about them is that they are less vile and violent than the Brave Companions, [[Locke|Vargo Hoat]]'s sellsword company. Gregor leaves them at Harrenhal when Cersei summons him to fight on her behalf; when Jaime arrives at Harrenhal on his way to the [[Second siege of Riverrun|besieged Riverrun]], the new castellan of Harrenhal, the pious Ser Bonifer Hasty, insists Jaime take the Mountain's men with them, as he won't have such sinners in his service. Jaime agrees to this, reasoning he can use them as cannon fodder if he has to storm Riverrun. After Riverrun is taken, Jaime orders them to escort members of the surrendered garrison who wish to take the black to [[Maidenpool]] so they can take ship for [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] (adding in a threat to kill them if any of the prisoners come to harm). After dealing with their antics in Maidenpool, [[Randyll Tarly]] outright insists the lot of them should be sent to the [[Night's Watch]].

Those who are mentioned specifically in the books are:
*[[Joss Stilwood]], Gregor's squire.
*{Rafford} aka Raff the Sweetling, who killed [[Lommy]]. Killed by [[Arya Stark]] at [[Braavos]].
*Dunsen, who took [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]'s bull helm.
*{The [[Tickler]]}, a torturer. Killed by Arya Stark during a [[Brawl in a tavern in the Riverlands|brawl]] at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]].
*{[[Polliver]]}, who took [[Needle|Arya's sword]]. Killed by the Hound at the Inn at the Crossroads, in the same brawl in which Arya kills the Tickler.
*{Chiswyck}, who assisted the Tickler with the torturing. Killed by [[Jaqen H'ghar]].
*Shitmouth, the most foul-mouthed of Gregor's soldiers, but less cruel than the rest. Gives extra food to captives if they ask him nicely.
*Eggon
*Tobbot
*{Unnamed squire} of [[House Sarsfield]]. Killed by Arya Stark at the Inn at the Crossroads.
*Two others, one castrated and the other executed for committing rape and murder in Maidenpool on the orders of Randyll Tarly.
*Unnamed soldier, executed for attempted rape at Harrenhal by Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] on the orders of [[Jaime Lannister]].

When Sandor escorts Sansa back to the Red Keep after the tournament feast, at Joffrey's command, he tells her the story of how his face was burned (not Littlefinger as happens in the TV series): a wood carver gave toys to both of the Clegane children in order to gain their father's patronage. Sandor wanted the articulated jointed knight that Gregor got, so he took it. Gregor was ten and already big enough to be training so he didn't even care about the toy, but when he found six year old Sandor playing with it - without warning he pushed Sandor's head into a brazier and held him there. It took three men to get Sandor away from him, and their father told people that Sandor's bed linens had caught fire. It was later when Gregor was anointed a knight that Sandor Clegane lost all respect for the institution of knighthood, and has steadfastly refused to be knighted himself.

Sandor also tells Sansa that the death of Hugh of the Vale was not a tournament accident. Ser Hugh had obviously put on the armor himself and had not set the neck protector correctly. He says Gregor saw that, and thus could have sent the blow elsewhere, and that the lance didn't just accidentally deflect upward, as Gregor puts his lance exactly where he intends it to go every time. He meant to kill Ser Hugh, though it isn't clear if this was an assassination to silence Hugh, or just Gregor enjoying the carnage (the revelation about [[Assassination of Jon Arryn|Jon Arryn's death]] supports the latter option).

In the second novel, while trying to broker an alliance for House Martell's support in the War of the Five Kings, Tyrion offers Doran Martell, among other concessions, to hand over Ser Gregor to face justice for the murders of Princess Elia and Prince Aegon. Tywin disapproves, claiming that Gregor has his uses, and every lord has need of a beast from time to time. Tyrion answers that "the woods are full of beasts", and Tywin says he'll think it over. Later, Tywin decides against the idea, stating that "Ser Gregor has served us well. No other knight in the realm inspires such terror in our enemies"; in order to appease the Martells, he comes up with the idea to put the entire blame on Amory Lorch (who is, quite conveniently, dead). As things turn to be, Tywin's new version of the death of Elia and her children does not stop Oberyn from fighting Gregor.

Gregor encounters and kills Beric Dondarrion twice (these are the first and the fourth of Beric's seven deaths): he impales Beric on a lance during the [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford]], and on later encounter (whose details are not specified) he stabs Beric in the eye with a dirk. Beric is resurrected on both occasions.

===Ser Robert Strong===
While treating Gregor Clegane, Qyburn theorizes that Oberyn had adulterated the manticore venom on his spear with sorcery; thickening it in order to slow its progress through the veins towards the heart, dragging out Gregor's agony. It is also not at Cersei's orders but Tywin's that Gregor is treated, though this is only to get him enough back to health so [[Ilyn Payne]] could execute him. After Gregor's public confession of his part in the murders of Elia Martell and her children, Tywin (who had always dismissed such talk as malicious rumors) intended to publicly execute Gregor in order to appease [[House Martell]], rather than risk their outrage at Elia and Oberyn's deaths causing [[Doran Martell]] to support [[Stannis Baratheon]] (though Tywin was killed by Tyrion before this could happen).

After Loras is sent to resolve the siege of Dragonstone, Qyburn tells Cersei that in case Loras dies, she will need to find another worthy for the Kingsguard. He claims "I had another sort of champion in mind. What he lacks in gallantry he will give you tenfold in devotion. He will protect your son, kill your enemies, and keep your secrets, and no living man will be able to withstand him." Cersei is skeptical; she orders a gigantic suit of armor at Qyburn's request -despite the blacksmith's insistence no living man can move or fight under such weight- but warns him that if he plays her for a fool, he will pay dearly.

As a gesture of good will, Cersei assigns Ser [[Balon Swann]] to deliver the supposed skull of Ser Gregor to the Martells, and most of them accept that the Mountain has finally been punished for his crimes (though it is a little consolation to Ellaria, who deeply mourns Oberyn). Only Obara is skeptical, suspecting a deception. Nymeria tells her half-sister to lighten up, as Gregor was the only 8-foot tall man in all of Westeros, and Cersei would be exposed as a liar before the entire continent if it turned out he was somehow still alive. What Nymeria says makes perfect sense, except that Cersei is far from being rational and clever. Obara has no idea how much she is close to the truth.

Following Cersei's downfall, Qyburn visits her in prison and informs her new champion stands ready. Cersei laughs bitterly, since she can be defended only by a sworn brother of the Kingsguard, but Loras somehow clings to life despite his mortal wounds, thus she cannot make a use of her invincible champion. However, when she hears from Kevan about Ser [[Arys Oakheart]]'s death, she sees a chance of survival: there is an empty place on the Kingsguard that must be filled. She begs her uncle to have Tommen appoint a man whom Qyburn knows his name.

Following Cersei's walk of penance, Qyburn introduces her to '''Ser Robert Strong''', a man clad from head to toe in white armor (no part of him is visible) and matching Gregor's physique. According to Qyburn, Strong has taken a holy vow of silence until all of King Tommen's enemies are defeated. According to [[Meryn Trant]], Strong never removes his helmet and is never seen to eat or drink, while [[Boros Blount]] claims Strong never uses the privy, which leads many people, including Kevan and Pycelle, to theorize that Robert Strong is actually Gregor, or maybe even a Frankenstein's monster assembled from the Mountain's body as well as other bodies. In the first novel (chapter 17), [[Bran Stark]] has a vision of a stone giant, apparently Ser Robert, and when his visor lifts, there is only darkness and black blood, leaving it ambiguous as to whether or not Strong even has a head.

In the television series, Cersei's new Kingsguard is not given a name, and what is seen of his face through his helmet matches that of Gregor, somewhat confirming that Gregor and Strong are the same man. In the sixth season of the series, he is still referred to as Gregor Clegane, and that the Robert Strong name having been dropped entirely.

While in the novels the murder of [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]] is assigned to [[Amory Lorch|Ser Amory Lorch]], another knight in the service of Tywin Lannister, the TV-series omitted this and Gregor is blamed for the death of Elia, Aegon and Rhaenys.
