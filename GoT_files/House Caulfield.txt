'''House Caulfield'''{{Ref|GOT504}}{{Note|Lady Caulfield's surname is Caulfield.}} is a noble house from [[Westeros]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] presents some paperwork to Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]] consisting of requests to various noble Houses to send new recruits to the [[Night's Watch]]. A few houses can spare any men during the [[War of the Five Kings]], so the Watch is left scraping the bottom of the barrel: the requests are mostly to minor lords that Jon says he hasn't even heard of, including Lady Caulfield.{{Ref|GOT504}}

==Members==
*[[Lady Caulfield]], head of the house.

==Behind the scenes==
Just as the "[[House Mazin]]" and "[[House Wibberley]]" mentioned in the same scene are inside references (to the showrunners' friends Craig Mazin and the scriptwriters Cormac and Marianne Wibberley respectively), the name - and specifically the fact that it is a ''Lady'' Caulfield - is apparently a reference to one of the TV series's producers, [[Bernadette Caulfield]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of any House Caulfield. The episode itself makes a joke about this when Jon Snow remarks that he has "never even heard of these people".
