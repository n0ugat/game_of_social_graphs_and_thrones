{{Quote|Princess, the queen has requested that the child be brought to her... immediately.|Elinda to Rhaenyra|The Princess and the Queen}}
'''Elinda Massey''' is a noblewoman of [[House Massey]], the daughter of Lord [[Gormon Massey]],<ref name="WBD" /> and a [[Handmaiden|lady-in-waiting]] to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Elinda is the daughter of Lord [[Gormon Massey]]. She also has a [[Gormon Massey's son|brother]] who was a [[squire]] to a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Tarly]] in [[112 AC]].{{Ref|HOTD101}} She is a trusted [[Handmaiden|lady-in-waiting]] to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]].<ref name="WBD" />

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
In [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|The Princess and the Queen}} Elinda informs Rhaenyra that [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] has requested the presence of [[Joffrey Velaryon|her newborn son]]. Elinda gives Rhaenyra warm soaked towels to sooth the pain in her breasts. She relocates to Dragonstone, after Rhaenyra decides to forsake the court of [[King's Landing]] for [[Dragonstone]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

In [[132 AC]],{{Dateref|The Lord of the Tides}} Elinda is present when [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] recites [[High Valyrian]] under the tutelage of Maester [[Gerardys]], she entertains the Queen's [[Joffrey Velaryon|younger son]] with a book. She is dismissed after [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] arrives and leaves the chamber with Prince Joffrey.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Elinda assists Rhaenyra during the birth of [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]], she begs the Queen to accept her help in delivering the child. She and the midwives are terrified by the stillbirth of Visenya. She is also present and bends the knee at her mistress's coronation as Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Elinda continues to serve Rhaenyra as a lady in waiting. Sensing her mistress's distracted mood following news of Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]]'s [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murder]] and Rhaenyra's subsequent argument with Daemon over his part in ordering it, Elinda offers to bring Rhaenyra a sleeping draught from [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Gerardys]], an offer Rhaenyra accepts and thanks Elinda for making. Before Elinda can leave, Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]] (infiltrating Dragonstone disguised as his [[Erryk Cargyll|twin]] on orders from Ser [[Criston Cole]] and King [[Aegon II]] to assassinate Rhaenyra) enters the room and draws his sword. Ser Erryk bursts in a moment later, and Elinda hides behind a table as [[Duel on Dragonstone|the brothers draw their swords and attack each other]]. Rhaenyra shouts at Elinda to run and find Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]], and Elinda flees the scene, returning moments later with Lorent, who puts himself between Rhaenyra and the brawling Cargylls. Elinda witnesses Erryk kill Arryk and then fall on his sword in guilt for his [[kinslaying]].{{Ref|HOTD202}}

==Behind the scenes==
Elinda Massey's character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"A trusted handmaiden to Queen Rhaenyra."''<ref name="WBD" />

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Elinda Massey was the youngest of Rhaenyra's handmaidens, and the only one identified by name. [[House Massey]] is staunchly loyal to the Targaryens and Velaryons as their lands are located on the peninsula known as Massey's Hook, which is the closest point on the mainland to Dragonstone and Driftmark.
