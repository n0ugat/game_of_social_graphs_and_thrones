Lady '''Baela Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Baelā Targārien''}} is the eldest daughter of [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Laena Velaryon]]. She becomes the ward of her grandmother [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] following her mother's death and the apparent death of [[Laenor Velaryon]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Baela Targaryen, named after her paternal grandfather [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]], is the eldest daughter of [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Laena Velaryon]], and is bonded with the young dragon [[Moondancer]]. She is the older sister of [[Rhaena Targaryen]].{{Guideref|Baela Targaryen}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
In [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|The Princess and the Queen}} Baela and her family live in [[Pentos]], as guests of Prince [[Reggio Haratis]]. Unlike her younger sister, Baela has a [[Moondancer|dragon]] and is preferred by [[Daemon Targaryen|their father]]. When her mother dies, Baela and her younger sister are shocked and sad.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Baela attends her mother's funeral at [[High Tide]]. She and her sister are warmly welcomed by their grandparents, especially [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]]. At the request of his [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|mother]], [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] comforts the grieving Baela by silently holding her hands. Later that night, her grandmother suggests to her [[Corlys Velaryon|grandfather]] that Baela should be made heir to [[Driftmark]]. Corlys rejects the suggestion.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

That night, Baela and her sister witness [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] flying [[Vhagar]], and they run to wake their cousin [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]]. The sisters, along with Jacaerys and his brother [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], confront Aemond at an entrance to the castle. Tempers flare and a fight breaks out, in which Aemond beats up Baela. The fight concludes when Lucerys takes Aemond's right eye in defense of Jacaerys. The [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] burst in and the children are taken to the Hall of Nine. Baela witnesses the wedding of Rhaenyra and [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]].{{Ref|HOTD107}}

In [[132 AC]],{{Dateref|The Lord of the Tides}} Baela has become a [[ward]] to her grandmother at Driftmark. She listens to Maester [[Kelvyn]] informing Rhaenys and her about the grave injuries sustained by [[Corlys Velaryon|her grandfather]]. As [[Vaemond Velaryon]] brings up the inheritance of Driftmark, Baela retorts that Rhaenys looks very comfortable on the [[Driftwood Throne]]. In the prelude to Vaemond's petitions to the [[Greens]], Rhaenys agrees to marry Baela to her cousin and future heir [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], in exchange for backing [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]]'s claim to Driftmark. Baela accompanies her grandmother to hear Vaemond petitions for the inheritance of Driftmark, then gets killed by her father. In the evening, Baela dines with her entire family, sans Rhaenys. [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] toasts her and Rhaena, while [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] makes several leery passes towards her. Tensions rise until a fight ensues, Baela attempts to defend Jacaerys by fighting Aegon, but is held back by her sister. She leaves [[King's Landing]] without her grandmother.{{Ref|HOTD108}}
[[File:TBQ Baela Jace Luke and Rhaena Still.jpg|thumb|Baela, [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Luke]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] at the [[Black Council]].]]
[[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] offers Rhaenys to grant the inheritance of Driftmark to her granddaughters, if Rhaenys helps maintain the peace.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Baela watches the funeral of [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]] on [[Dragonstone]]. After Rhaenyra is crowned, she and her sister kneel, unlike her grandmother. Baela gathers around the [[Painted Table]], as part of the [[Black Council]]. Her father states her to be the [[Dragonrider|dragonrider]] of [[Moondancer]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Baela is present at the [[Black Council]] when Rhaenyra returns from the [[Stormlands]]. She accompanies Jacaerys, as he seeks out his mother, to inform her about his journey to the [[North]] and [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. Baela later attends the funeral of Lucerys.{{Ref|HOTD201}}
[[File:S2 Baela Targaryen.jpg|thumb|Riding [[Moondancer]] in the Crownlands.]]
While heading to Rhaenyra's chamber, Baela runs into her father. Baela tries to talk to him, but Daemon is so furious at having argued with Rhaenyra that he remains silent. Once in the queen's room, Baela receives orders to patrol King's Landing on the back of Moondancer. When Baela asks where her father is going, her stepmother only responds that Daemon will take his own path.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Baela practices bank shooting on a cliff. Jacaerys appears says that he imagines going to [[Harrenhal]]. Baela comments that sometimes she thinks she hates her father. Jacaerys comments that the parents are complicated, and he starts talking about his biological father [[Harwin Strong]] and his adoptive father [[Laenor Velaryon]]. Then he says that he miss [[Lucerys Velaryon|his brother]]. Baela puts a hand on his shoulder to comfort him.{{Ref|HOTD202}}[[File:2x3 Rhaenyra and Baela Still.jpg|thumb|Baela and [[Rhaenyra]].]]Baela, alongside Rhaenyra and Jacaerys, say goodbye to Rhaena, [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]], [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]], and [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]], before they leave to the safety of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. Rhaena is discontent about having to go away to serve as a babysitter; Baela tries to cheer her up by assuring her that her mission is very important, including taking care of the four dragon eggs to the Vale.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Baela, atop Moondancer, scouts the [[Crownlands]] and sees [[Criston Cole]], [[Gwayne Hightower]], and a party of Hightower knights. She dives towards them, but the Greens make it to the treeline. Baela and Moondancer break off their attack to avoid crashing into the trees. After repeatedly circling around the trees to no avail, Baela flies away to Dragonstone and inform Rhaenyra of Criston Cole's movements.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

After arriving at Dragonstone, Baela reports to the Black Council that she and Moondancer saw Criston Cole's small party. The Black Council conclude that Cole's army is heading towards Harrenhal.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Following Rhaenyra's absence to King's Landing, Baela Targaryen reports on her latest findings after riding [[Moondancer]]: the armies of Ser Criston, cautious of the threat of dragons, now mostly ride at night and under tree cover in the Riverlands, as they advance northwest towards an unknown destination. The lack of certainty irritates Ser [[Alfred Broome]], who grudgingly says she should've burned them earlier when she had the opportunity. Jacaerys defends Baela, as they only possess any information because of her efforts. <ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 4: "[[The Red Dragon and the Gold]]" (2024).</ref>

The members of the [[Black Council]] bicker among themselves due to the lack of any word from Prince Daemon in recent days.After many days of absence, Rhaenyra Targaryen returns to [[Dragonstone]], now with full certainty that Viserys wished for her to succeed him in the Iron Throne and aware peace with the Greens is no longer an option; she must fight or die. Jace briefly protests her journey to King's Landing as an unecessary risk, but assures everyone stands with her still. Rhaenyra is informed that Cole plans to march on Rook's Rest, as the keep of council member [[Simon Staunton]], and boldly states her intention to fly there on [[Syrax]] herself, but is convinced by Rhaenys that the best course of action is to send her and her mount [[Meleys]] there instead.<ref name=":0" />
[[File:2x5 Baela and Rhaenyra Still.jpg|thumb|Rhaenyra comforts Baela over her grief.]]
Rhaenyra comforts Baela over the loss of her grandmother. She then sends Baela to ask [[Corlys Velaryon|Corlys]] to be her [[Hand of the King|Hand]]. Jace walks in the library of Dragonstone where he finds his betrothed Baela reading. He intends to fly to Harrenhal to confront Daemon about his loyalty to Rhaenyra and to report his course of action. Baela tries convincing him to stay as Daemon is unpredictable. However, Jace still wishes to participate in the war, scouting or fighting for his mother but Baela reassures him that Rhaenyra is protecting him, but he insists on taking action for his and his mother's claim to the Iron Throne. He then plans to treat with [[House Frey]], who control the crossing at the [[Twins]], which Cregan Stark's greybeards need to march south. Baela comments that Rhaenyra will not savor his leave, and he says not to tell her till he is absent. Baela delivers him the Hand sigil, but mourning [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]], he initially refuses.  Baela blames her grandfather for already doing it after the death of her son, Laenor, and says that Rhaenys died as she wanted: with honour and dragon fire, as she herself would want to die. Baela convinces him to accept. In turn, he wants to make her his heir, though she refuses, saying that she is a Targaryen and [[Driftmark]] needs a [[House Velaryon|Velaryon]].<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 5: "[[Regent (episode)|Regent]]" (2024).</ref>

The Black Council, led by [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], meets and summons Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]]. Rhaenyra explains her situation; [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and [[Meleys]] are dead, she has no armies in [[Westeros]], and cannot go into battle for fear of being captured or dying. Ser Steffon notes that there are Daemon, [[Caraxes]] and the Rivermen, but Rhaenyra says that this still needs to be ascertained. She thenstates that she needs new dragonriders for the dragons present. Ser Steffon says that there are no other Targaryens capable of riding dragons. He mentions Rhaena, but Corlys says that the dragons present would not accept her. When Ser Steffon wonders who could try, Rhaenyra reveals the reason behind her summoning. She thinks that he, being distantly related to [[Aeriana Targaryen|a Targaryen]], could succeed in the enterprise.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 6: "[[Smallfolk (episode)|Smallfolk]]" (2024).</ref>[[File:2x7 Baela Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|Baela on the [[Black Council]].]]Rhaenyra returns to Dragonstone with Addam and Seasmoke. The council, along with Baela, meets without Rhaenyra. [[Lorent Marbrand]] and [[Gerardys]] arrive. Lorent informs the council that the queen is unharmed, relieving those present. Corlys asks if they know who the rider is, and Gerardys says that he is a carpenter in the employ of Corlys, who is surprised. Bartimos Celtigar tells Corlys that while he "respects" his workers, in his opinion low-borns cannot go around seizing dragons, asking if the "Thief" is under surveillance. Gerardys informs that, by the Queen's will, Addam will remain there as a guest and will be trained in dragonriding and tutored in High Valyrian. Lord Bartimos points out that they know nothing about him except that he is a low-born, asking for advice from Corlys. He states that they will wait to hear from the queen before passing judgment. Jace asks with a shaking voice where the queen is. Ser Lorent informs them that the queen has informed that she will not be present.<ref name=":1">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 7: "[[The Red Sowing]]" (2024).</ref>

The Dragonseeds arrive by ship at Dragonstone, where Rhaenyra awaits them. As Rhaenyra descends to meet them, an older dragonkeeper declares in High Valyrian that this is an abomination. Rhaenyra, still in High Valyrian, asks what he is talking about. He also states that their order will have no part in this and leaves, followed by all the dragonkeepers of Dragonstone. Rhaenyra is shocked but is not discouraged, so she approaches the Dragonseeds followed by Ser Lorent, Baela and Addam and speaks to them, she tells them that she thought she knew what it meant to claim a dragon, but now she means that what she knew is ashes in the wind. She says that if they add those two dragons to their numbers, the enemy will have to give way and peace will return, and with it the suffering will cease, and if the gods will it, no more blood will be shed. She then looks briefly at a dragon skull, then turns to the dragonseeds and informs them of the dragon they will have to tame, [[Vermithor]], the Bronze Fury, that is the largest dragon in the world after Vhagar and then leads them towards it, telling them who hopes that the gods bless them. Rhaenyra, followed by Ser Lorent, Addam, Baela, Maester Gerardys, some Dragonstone guards and the Dragonseeds go to the base under Dragonmount, when they are all on the stone bridge, Rhaenyra commands Vermithor to show himself, after a while, from the shadows appears the mighty Vermithor growling, Rhaenyra commands him to calm down, which Vermithor does, he approaches Rhaenyra and she puts a hand on his muzzle and both she and Vermithor close their eyes, for a moment they remain still, then Rhaenyra opens her eyes and turns to the Dragonseeds. Vemithor throws a blast of flame, then proceeds to burn and eat most of them alive.<ref name=":1" />
[[File:S2 Rhaenyra Jace Baela and Dragonseeds.png|thumb|Baela attends a banquet with the dragonseeds.]]
Angered by [[Ulf]]'s insolence, Jace threatens to hang him if he displays disloyalty or incompetence. Baela later empathises with Jace, and expresses her concerns about civilian casualties, as does Rhaenyra. During supper, Rhaenyra promises knighthood to Addam, [[Hugh]], and Ulf if they serve her well; she announces they leave in two days to attack [[Greens|Green]] strongholds, [[Lannisport]] and [[Oldtown]].<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 8: "[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]" (2024).</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
On March 30, 2022, [[HBO]] announced that [[Bethany Antonia]] had been cast in the role of Baela Targaryen for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. Her character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] reads as follows:
:''"Eldest daughter of Laena Velaryon and rider of the young dragon Moondancer."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

In a deleted scene Baela insists on fighting for Rhaenyra. When Baela proclaims herself a dragonrider and says that the [[Greens]] must be answered with fire and blood, Rhaenys muses that she just saw her daughter Laena for the first time in years.{{Webref|name=Deleted |author=Kim Renfro |date=December 11, 2022 |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/house-of-the-dragon-deleted-baela-and-rhaenys-scene-2022-12 |title='House of the Dragon' cocreator Ryan Condal reveals deleted Baela and Rhaenys scene |website=Business Insider |access-date=June 20, 2024 }}

Her character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"The eldest daughter of Daemon Targaryen and Laena Velaryon, Baela is betrothed to Prince Jacaerys and rides the young dragon Moondancer."''{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Baela and Rhaena are described as twins, but not identical twins: they started out looking very similar, but in their teenage years their appearance and personalities diverged. The TV series changed this to make Baela slightly older than Rhaena. In the book, Baela was the elder twin by a matter of minutes.

Baela is described as fierce and fearless, very much her father's daughter - and in contrast to her sister Rhaena's more lady-like nature.
