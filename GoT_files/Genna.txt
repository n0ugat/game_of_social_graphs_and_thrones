{{Dialogue a-b|Tyrion Lannister|Genna specializes in first-timers.|Bronn|She's not bad with second-timers, either.|[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Bronn]] introduce [[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] to Genna|Walk of Punishment (episode)}}
'''Genna''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who works in [[Littlefinger's brothel]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Along with [[Marei]] and [[Kayla]], she is one of the three prostitutes in Littlefinger's brothel who are hired by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to service [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] as a reward for saving his life in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Tyrion suggests that Genna specializes first-time customers looking to lose their virginity, although [[Bronn]] indicates that she also services regulars. Genna and her colleagues are apparently so satisfied with Podrick that they decline payment, much to the astonishment of Tyrion, Bronn, [[Ros]], and even [[Varys]].{{Ref|GOT303}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no prostitute named Genna. The only character by that name is [[Genna Lannister|Tywin's sister]]. This would seem to continue the TV producers' general practice that when they invent new characters for the TV series, they still try to use names from the books which are established to exist in Westeros (instead of making up entirely new ones, which might not sound like they fit).

In the TV series, Tyrion pronounced "Genna" with a soft G, as opposed to a hard G.
