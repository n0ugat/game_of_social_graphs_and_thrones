'''Deepwood Motte'''{{Ref|GOT203}} is the stronghold of [[House Glover]], a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. The castle is located north-west of [[Winterfell]] in the [[Wolfswood]], near the coast of the [[Bay of Ice]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Having declared himself [[King of the Iron Islands|King]], [[Balon Greyjoy]] sends his daughter [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] with a fleet of thirty ships with orders to seize Deepwood Motte. Yara replies that she always wanted a castle of her own.<ref>"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]"</ref> She successfully [[Attack on Deepwood Motte|captures]] the castle.<ref>"[[The Broken Man]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Yara informs her father that House Glover had [[Fight by Deepwood Motte|retaken control]] of Deepwood Motte from [[House Greyjoy]].<ref>"[[Home]]"</ref>

While making plans to retake the North, [[Jon Snow]] lists the Glovers as one of the houses that have not yet declared for the Boltons, along with the [[House Hornwood|Hornwoods]], [[House Cerwyn|Cerwyns]], [[House Mormont|Mormonts]], and [[House Mazin|Mazins]].<ref>"[[The Door]]"</ref> After visiting [[Bear Island]], Jon and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] travel to Deepwood Motte to seek the support of House Glover. They receive a frosty reception from [[Robett Glover]], who is still bitter towards Robb for not coming to his aid during the Ironborn attack on Deepwood Motte and for jeopardizing the northmen's sacrifices and war efforts for a "[[Talisa Stark|foreign whore]]". Still bitter about the Ironborn occupation, Robett refuses to come to their aid.<ref>"[[The Broken Man]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Deepwood Motte is a motte-and-bailey wooden castle, rather than a more formidable stone construction. In past centuries, the castle and the surrounding area were prey to long-ranging raids by the [[ironborn]], but it has been some considerable time since this was the case. The castle is not located on the coast due to the muddy tidal flats along the coast. Instead it is built on a hill which commands the surrounding area. Since it is inadequately fortified, it has been relatively easy for the ironborn to seize it, but also easy for [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] to liberate it.

Deepwood Motte is located approximately three hundred miles from Winterfell.

As in the television series, the castle is seized by Ironborn forces under Asha Greyjoy (Yara in the TV show).

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Stannis [[Fight by Deepwood Motte#In the books|attacks]] Deepwood Motte at [[Jon Snow]]'s advice, with an unexpected assistance of House Mormont, and liberates the castle from the ironborn. Nearly all Asha's troops and ships are destroyed, and she is taken captive. The victory grants Stannis credibility in the eyes of House Glover and other Northern houses, and they join his campaign against the Boltons.

In the television series, Deepwood Motte is liberated off-screen by the Glovers who slaughter every Ironborn there. Yara is not present during the [[Fight by Deepwood Motte|fight]] but relates news of its fall to her father [[Balon Greyjoy]]. In the episode "[[Home]]", the fall of Deepwood Motte causes the Ironborn to lose their last remaining stronghold in the North, while in the books the ironborn still hold Torrhen's Square.
