{{Quote|The [[Triarchs of Volantis|Volantine masters]] mark their property with facial tattoos, permanent and scarring, which denote the vocation of the [[Slavery|slave]]. Slave soldiers wear green tiger stripes upon their faces.|[[Varys]]|Volantis (short)}}
The '''tiger cloaks'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} are [[Slavery|slave]] soldiers owned by the [[triarchs of Volantis]]. Their faces are tattooed with green tiger stripes to mark them as such.{{Ref|H&L503}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the tiger cloaks act as the city guard of [[Volantis]], serving the ruling [[Triarchs of Volantis|triarchs]]. Their name comes from the militant tiger party and they are fiercely proud of the green tiger marks tattooed on their cheeks. Their helms are fashioned to look like tiger masks and their gauntlets are covered with steel claws. Around half of the tiger cloaks are worshippers of [[Lord of Light|R'hllor]].

[[Tyrion Lannister]] encounters several tiger cloaks in [[Selhorys]] and wonders if they desire freedom and what they would do if [[Daenerys Targaryen]] granted it to them. One of them rubs his head and remarks that it is good luck to rub the head of a [[dwarf]], though Tyrion is too started to resist.
