{{Quote|The North has dulled many good Maesters' wits. Hard to say whether it's the cold, the drink or the company. A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the Wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes?|Sandhu|Eastwatch}}
'''Sandhu''' is an [[Archmaester]] of the [[Citadel]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Sandhu meets with the other Archmaesters of the Citadel to discuss a [[raven]] they have received from [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Wolkan]] at [[Winterfell]], claiming that [[Bran Stark]] has seen the [[Night King]] and [[Wight|his army]] marching on [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] through [[warg]]ing. Sandhu is very skeptical of this and suggests that [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] discipline his mind with more scribing; Sam insists that they take the message seriously. He agrees with Archmaester [[Ebrose]] that the message could be a ploy by [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] to leave [[Westeros]] defenseless, by having the [[Great House]]s send their armies to the [[Wall]]. He compares the content of the message to the work of [[Lodos]], a prophet who claimed that the [[Drowned God]] would rise up and destroy [[Aegon I Targaryen]].{{Ref|GOT705}}
