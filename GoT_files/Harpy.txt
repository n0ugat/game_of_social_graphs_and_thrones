The '''harpy'''{{Ref|GOT401}} is a mythical creature in the culture of [[Essos]], whose likeness is used as the symbol of the [[Ghiscari Empire]], as well its colony-cities in [[Slaver's Bay]], where Ghiscari culture survives to this day. Harpies are shown as having the head and torso of a woman and the wings, tail, and legs of a bird.

Harpies are shown prominently in the city of [[Astapor]] on [[Slaver's Bay]]. A great statue of a harpy can be seen on the walls of Astapor overlooking the bay.<ref>"[[Valar Dohaeris]]"</ref> The harpy of the Astapori flag is depicted holding, between her talons, a chain with open manacles on both ends.<ref>"[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"</ref>

During the [[Siege of Meereen]], as the local [[Slavery|slave]] population rises in arms against the [[Great Masters]], an enormous black banner with the three-headed red dragon of [[House Targaryen]] is draped over the harpy by dissidents. After the revolt is victorious and the city falls to [[Daenerys Targaryen]], she takes up residence in the Great Pyramid. The Queen's private residence lies at the very top, just below the Harpy.<ref>"[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]"</ref>

The [[Unsullied]] pull down the harpy statue on top of the pyramid to signify that the days of the Masters' rule are gone.<ref>"[[The Wars To Come]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the harpy is the ancient sigil of the [[Ghiscari Empire]], described as having a bat's wings, an eagle's talons, and a scorpion's tail. On the Ghiscari flag, the harpy is shown clutching a thunderbolt in its talons. [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]] destroyed the Ghiscari Empire and conquered its lands, but after the [[Doom of Valyria]] Ghiscari culture reasserted itself. The nation of Ghiscar, expanding from the island city of [[New Ghis]], bears the harpy on its flag.

The city-states of Slaver's Bay (Astapor, [[Yunkai]], and [[Meereen]]), although not subject to the new Ghiscari kingdom of New Ghis, are Ghiscari in culture and origin and also employ the harpy as their sigil. The Astapori harpy holds a chain with open manacles, the Yunkish harpy holds a whip and an iron collar, while the Meereenese harpy holds nothing.

The TV series depicts harpies with bird's wings and tail, keeping them closer in design to the [[wikipedia:Harpy|harpies]] of real-world Greek mythology than the bat-winged harpies of Ghiscari mythology described in the books.
