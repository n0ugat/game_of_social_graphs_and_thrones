{{Quote|The Wise Masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the Silver Queen.|[[Razdal mo Eraz]] to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]|The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)}}
The '''Wise Masters'''{{Ref|GOT307}}, also known as the '''Wise Masters of Yunkai''',{{Ref|GOT307}} are the ruling elite of the city of [[Yunkai]], one of the three cities of eastern shores of [[Slaver's Bay]], composed of [[Slavery|slave-traders]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
After hearing about what [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] did to [[Astapor]]'s [[Good Masters]] during the [[fall of Astapor]], the Wise Masters of Yunkai sent [[Razdal mo Eraz|an envoy]] to her army, which had camped just outside the city, offering gold so that she would agree to abandon [[Essos]] and leave the slavers in peace to continue with their affairs. She rebuffed their offer, although she kept the gold.<ref>"[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]"</ref> After [[Daario Naharis]] betrayed his commanders, breached the contract the [[Second Sons]] had with Yunkai and put the two thousand mercenaries at the service of Daenerys<ref>"[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"</ref>, the Wise Masters were overthrown during the [[battle in Yunkai]]. Soon after, many of the newly freed slaves vacated the city and proclaimed Daenerys as their "mother."<ref>"[[Mhysa]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
However, eventually the Wise Masters regained control of the city and re-enslaved the inhabiting freedmen.<ref>"[[First of His Name]]"</ref> Daenerys, now ruler of [[Meereen]], sent Daario Naharis and his Second Sons back to Yunkai alongside [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]], a Meereenese [[Great Masters|Great Master]] at her service, so that he could offer the Wise Masters the option of abandoning slavery once and for all, or else they would be put to the sword.<ref>"[[Mockingbird]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
The Wise Masters agreed to renounce slavery, with the proposal that the fighting pits be reopened, though only with willing participants using them now. Daenerys initially rejected this, but later reconsidered after Daario relates to her winning in the pits had helped him make his fortune, join the Second Sons and thus meet her.<ref>"[[The Wars To Come]]"</ref>[[File:RazdalMoEraz.jpg|thumb|200px|Razdal mo Eraz, one of Yunkai's Wise Masters.]]

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
The Wise Masters launch an [[Siege of Astapor|attack on Astapor]], overthrowing King [[Cleon]]'s junta and restore slavery to the city, reinstating the Good Masters.<ref>"[[Home]]"</ref>

* The Perfumed Hero

Each of the Wise Masters has a private army. Those armies are no more than jokes: for instance, the Clanker Lords have chained their troops together in groups of ten, wrist to wrist and ankle to ankle.

The members of Windblown sellsword company, which was hired by Yunkai, have a very low opinion about the Wise Masters and their private "armies". They take delight in inventing ridiculous nicknames for the Wise Masters, as written above, and mocking them at every opportunity (not in their presence, of course).

[[Razdal mo Eraz]] is named "Grazdan mo Eraz" in the novels; the TV series apparently changed his name to avoid confusion, as "Grazdan" is a very common name in Slaver's Bay held by multiple characters.

In the novels, [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]] is actually one of the Wise Masters from [[Yunkai]], morbidly obese and one of the leading slave-masters. The TV series heavily condensed the role so when he appears in Season 5, he is just a slender, normal-looking slave-trader who purchases Tyrion and Jorah at auction when they arrive in Meereen - without specifying if he is actually one of the [[Great Masters]] "from" Meereen, or if he is a Yunkish slaver-master who just happens to be ''in'' Meereen for the Great Games.

The Wise Masters endlessly bicker among themselves over who has precedence, both in terms of raw power and more arcane and complex principles of peerage which are confusing and inscrutable to outsiders. When their armies march out against Daenerys there are a disproportionately large number of "captains" and "commanders", about forty, because any slave-master who can muster up a two hundred poorly trained slaves considers himself the equal of one of the more powerful ones who actually possesses two thousand well-trained footsoldiers. The Wise Masters heavily rely upon hired sellsword companies and slave-soldiers: even the sellswords that accept their contracts for good payment consider the slave-masters themselves to generally be foppish aristocrats playing at politics and war.

Yurkhaz zo Yunzak is the most prominent of the Wise Masters and the Supreme Commander of the Armies and Allies of Yunkai. Grazdan mo Eraz and Yezzan zo Qaggaz are two of the most capable of the Wise Masters.

Eraz is a skilled diplomat, first attempting to simply bribe Daenerys to leave, and later he seeks to make common cause with the slaver-masters in [[Volantis]], deftly flattering them with gifts and propaganda about what a tyrant Daenerys has become - and succeeds.

Yezzan, however, stands foremost amongst the Yunkish lords who favor honoring the peace with Meereen. He objects to those who want to assault the city immediately, nor does he consent to return the hostages Daenerys has delivered them (Daario, Jhogo, Hero, Groleo and three of Hizdahr's kin) by way of trebuchet, as the evil sellsword Bloodbeard has proposed. Yezzan, more intelligently, urges caution and diplomacy - saying that fighting Daenerys's Unsullied and her growing dragons is more trouble than it is worth, and if they start fighting her again they might lose and end up being overthrown. However, Yurkhaz zo Yunzak is the one who makes the decisions for Yunkai, and he leads the Yunkai army to fight Daenerys.

Following Yurkhaz's death, Yezzan had the most support to replace him, but he has contracted the bloody flux and died. The rest of the Yunkish lords are no more than incompetent fools, and are unable to agree who should take charge. They have been rotating the supreme command amongst themselves; naturally, that adds to the chaos that erupted in their ranks - what works in favor of Daenerys's loyalists.

Unlike the Great Masters of Meereen, of which six slaver families were identifies as the major ones (alongside other smaller ones), the leading families of Wise Masters haven't been clearly identified. The family names of some of the Wise Masters leading Yunkai's army against Daenerys are Qaggaz, Eraz, Myraq, Rhaezn, Ahlaq, Zerzyn, and Faez - but it wasn't clarified if all of these are "major" families, given the direct complaint that less powerful slave-masters were claiming equal right to command over their combined forces, etc.
