{{Quote|My father remembered a beautiful woman with purple eyes who danced with Ser Barristan Selmy and several others. As the end of the evening approached, Brandon Stark asked her for one more dance on his shy brother's behalf, and so Eddard Stark shared the last dance of the celebration with Lady Ashara Dayne.|[[Meera Reed]]|The Great Tourney at Harrenhal}}
Lady '''Ashara Dayne''' was a lady of [[House Dayne]] and the sister of [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Arthur Dayne]], the [[Sword of the Morning]].

==Biography==
Lady Ashara Dayne was present at the great [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Harrenhal]] in the [[Year of the False Spring]], where she danced with Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and several others. Towards the end of the evening, she was approached by [[Brandon Stark]] who asked her for a dance on behalf of his shy younger brother [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]]. She accepted and she and Eddard shared the last dance of the celebration.{{Ref|H&L605}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lady Ashara Dayne was renowned for her great beauty. She was tall and had long hair and violet eyes. She was an object of infatuation for many men, including Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and, according to rumor, [[Eddard Stark]].

Ashara was a lady-in-waiting to Princess [[Elia Martell]].

Following the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy]], Eddard traveled to [[Starfall]] to inform [[House Dayne]] of Ser [[Arthur Dayne]]'s death and return his sword, [[Dawn]]. Ashara committed suicide by throwing herself from the top of the Palestone Sword, the tallest tower in [[Starfall]], onto the cliff atop the sea. Her body was never found.

Ashara was suspected to be the mother of [[Jon Snow]], and that her suicide was caused by the grief over the role her alleged lover Eddard played in her brother's death. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] asked him if this was true, and Eddard angrily told her to never ask him about Jon, that the boy was his blood and that this was all she needed to know (Catelyn notes his fury in that moment was the only time in their marriage where Ned legitimately frightened her). Ashara's name was never mentioned in [[Winterfell]] again after this. When Ned confronts [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] over her children's illegitimacy, she asks whether it was Ned killing her brother or stealing her son that drove Ashara to suicide.

Despite these rumors, Selmy believed that Ashara had given birth to a stillborn daughter, and that a man had dishonored her during the tourney at Harrenhal. While remembering what Ashara Dayne looked like, he remarks that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] resembles her, sharing the same violet eyes as her. He claims that when Daenerys looked at him, he felt that he was looking at Ashara's supposed daughter.
