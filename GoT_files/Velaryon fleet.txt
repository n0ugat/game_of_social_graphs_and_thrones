==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:SOHN Stepstones.png|left|thumb|Four ships of the fleet under attack by Triarchy siege weapons. Caraxes providing cover.]]
During the final stages of the [[siege of Bloodstone]] within the [[War for the Stepstones]], House Velaryon's military forces include 700 [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], sixty [[Knighthood|knights]], and sixteen to eighteen ships, though more can be sent from Driftmark. While [[Corlys Velaryon]] assembles his men and war council, three Velaryon ships that are sailing past [[Bloodstone]] are attacked by the [[Triarchy]]'s forces, with one ship being hit.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

Corlys brings the entire Velaryon fleet to [[King's Landing]] for his son [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]]'s wedding to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Overcome with anger and grief from having lost both of his children due to his relentless ambitions, Corlys leaves Driftmark, and returns to the fighting in the Stepstones after the Triarchy becomes resurgent.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 8: "[[The Lord of the Tides]]" (2022).</ref>

After six years of fighting in the Stepstones, Corlys is severely injured in an ambush, reportedly having his throat slashed by a corsair and falling into the sea. Despite Corlys's near-death in the Stepstones, House Velaryon now controls the islands, having driven the Triarchy's forces out of the region and properly garrisoned the islands against their return. <ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 10: "[[The Black Queen]]" (2022).</ref>

In Blackwater Bay, the Velaryon fleet intercepts one of the last ships leaving King's Landing. Ser [[Erryk Cargyll]] of Rhaenyra's Queensguard leads a boarding party to search the hold for stowaways, and finds a bedraggled [[Mysaria]], who managed to escape Larys's agents burning her house. They recognize each other, as Erryk was present alongside his twin brother when Mysaria met with Otto to negotiate the return of Aegon. He has her taken back to Dragonstone.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 1: "[[A Son for a Son]]" (2024).</ref>

The repairs on the ''Sea Snake'', now called the ''Queen Who Never Was'', are finished, and Corlys sails his ship to the Gullet.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 8: "[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]" (2024).</ref> 

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Velaryon fleet is traditionally part of the larger [[royal fleet]]. Hundreds of years prior to the [[War of the Five Kings]], it made up most of the royal fleet and was considered the most powerful naval force in the [[Seven Kingdoms]].

It was the Velaryon fleet that carried the forces of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] to the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush]] when he started [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]]. Lord Daemon Velaryon was thereafter named [[Master of Ships|master of ships]] and led his fleet against the combined forces of the [[Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of Mountain and Vale]] and [[Braavos]]. The Velaryon fleet was defeated in a battle in the waters off [[Gulltown]], and Lord Velaryon was killed.

The Velaryon fleet was used in two campaigns against the [[Lys]]ene pirate king Sargoso Saan in 29 and 30 AC, ferrying [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] military forces to the [[Stepstones]].

Rogar Baratheon, to no avail, petitioned [[Daemon Velaryon]] (the grandson of the aforementioned Daemon) to blockade [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] with the Velaryon fleet to prevent various [[Lordship|lords]] from visiting the young [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|King Jaehaerys]] and currying favor with him.

In 54 AC, Lord Daemon proposed to send the Velaryon fleet to [[Oldtown]] to strongarm the [[Most Devout]] into electing a royalist [[High Septon]].

During the War of the Five Kings, the Velaryon fleet is part of [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s naval forces. It takes heavy losses during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], including Monford Velaryon and his flagship ''Pride of Driftmark''.
