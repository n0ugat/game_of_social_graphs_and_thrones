{{Quote|I do not know the place from where old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them, or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. "Mercy," "fair trial," these mean ''nothing'' to them! All they understand is blood!|Mossador|The House of Black and White}}
'''Mossador''' was a former [[Slavery|slave]] from [[Meereen]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Mossador attempts to convince his fellow slaves to join [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and defeat the [[Great Masters]], though he meets resistance from skeptical older slaves who have lived through failed slave rebellions. After [[Grey Worm]] motivates them even further than Mossador and provides them with weapons, they launch a [[Siege of Meereen|revolt]] against the Masters.{{Ref|GOT404}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Mossador, now representing Meereen's freedmen in Daenerys's [[Small Council#Under Daenerys Targaryen|Small Council]], reports to [[Daenerys Targaryen]] along with [[Grey Worm]] that [[White Rat]], one of the [[Unsullied]], was found with his throat slit at a brothel, murdered by the [[Sons of the Harpy]].{{Ref|GOT501}}

[[File:Mossadur before execution.png|thumb|Mossador before he is executed.]]
Mossador is present when the council debates what should be done with a [[Son of the Harpy|captured Harpy's Son]]. When the queen decides to give the prisoner a fair trial, Mossador interprets Daenerys's decision on the matter to mean that her hands are tied, and without permission, kills the captive. Daenerys has him brought out in chains before a crowd for execution, as a warning to everyone, freed slave or Great Master, not to pervert the course of justice. He pleads for forgiveness but she has [[Daario Naharis|Daario]] cut off his head, causing a riot.{{Ref|GOT502}}

==Behind the scenes==
The character was originally credited as "slave" in Season 4. Season 5 casting news revealed the character's name as "Keyr", but on March 21st it was revealed the character's name was changed to "Mossador".<ref>http://watchersonthewall.com/titles-for-game-of-thrones-season-five-episodes-5-7-have-been-revealed-plus-a-character-renamed/#more-27969</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mossador is the name of one of the three brothers of [[Missandei]] who were enslaved alongside her and made into [[Unsullied]] and one of two who survived the training. After being liberated by Daenerys, Mossador is one of the Unsullied who reclaims his birth name. While patrolling the streets of Meereen at night, Mossador and another of the Unsullied were ambushed by the Sons of the Harpy. They were crushed to death by falling stones beneath the river wall.

"Mossador" in the TV series is ''not'' Missandei's brother: the TV writers just re-used a name from the novels for a separate character. While he has no direct counterpart in the novels, TV-Mossador is a condensation of several former slave characters in Meereen who don't want peace with the former slave masters.
