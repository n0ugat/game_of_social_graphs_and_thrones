The '''Blacks'''{{Ref|TDOD}} are a political faction that support the claim of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] as heir to the [[Iron Throne]]. During the [[Dance of the Dragons]], they oppose the [[Greens]], who support [[Aegon II Targaryen]].

==History==
===Background===
The Blacks began as a political faction in the royal court of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Viserys I Targaryen]] in [[King's Landing]], being founded sometime after [[116 AC]].{{Dateref|We Light the Way}} They were named so after the traditional colors of [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]], black and red.{{Ref|TDOD}} Members of the faction, including Princess Rhaenyra and her family, were identified by wearing clothing bearing some combination of the two colors. 

The Blacks support Princess Rhaenyra’s claim as heir to the Iron Throne, based of her original proclamation as [[Prince of Dragonstone|Princess of Dragonstone]] by her father, King Viserys, in [[112 AC]].{{Dateref|The Heirs of the Dragon}} This is in opposition to the claim of Viserys's eldest son, Prince Aegon, based off traditional male-preference primogeniture as purported by the Greens.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
In the aftermath of King Viserys's death, Lord [[Lyman Beesbury]] is the only member of Viserys's Small Council to speak out against the Greens' usurpation of the throne, going so far as to accuse the other members of the council of regicide. He is unintentionally killed by Ser [[Criston Cole]], leaving the Small Council in the control of the Greens, from which the [[Green Council]] is formed. The Greens later discuss replacing two captains amongst the [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|City Watch]] who are loyal to [[Daemon Targaryen]] with members loyal to them.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Later, several lords previously aligned to the Blacks bow to Aegon under duress during the Greens' [[coup in King's Landing]]. [[Lord Merryweather]] and [[Lady Fell]] are two of the few who remain publicly loyal to Rhaenyra and subsequently are imprisoned. Lord [[Allun Caswell]] feigns his loyalty to the Greens and attempts to flee King's Landing to warn Rhaenyra of the Greens' seizure of power. However, he is quickly intercepted, interrogated, and executed before he can leave the capital.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

After learning of the Green Council's coup in the capital, Rhaenyra forms her own [[Black Council]] based on Dragonstone and is subsequently crowned queen.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

Two members of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]], [[Steffon Darklyn]] and [[Lorent Marbrand]], followed Rhaenyra to Dragonstone when she left the royal court in [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|The Princess and the Queen}} ostensibly to protect the princess and her family.{{Ref|HOTD108}} They continue to be loyal to Rhaenyra once the succession crisis begins, forming her initial Queensguard. Ser [[Erryk Cargyll]] joins them after defecting from the Greens, pledging his loyalty to her and presenting to Rhaenyra her father's crown.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

At the start of the Dance of the Dragons, the Blacks hold the support of only a few minor houses throughout the [[Crownlands]], [[Stormlands]], and the [[Reach]]. This leaves the Blacks at a significant numerical disadvantage in terms of manpower in comparison to the Greens. However, the Blacks have a superior advantage in terms of dragons under their control, possessing eight ([[Arrax]], [[Caraxes]], [[Meleys]], [[Moondancer]], [[Stormcloud]], [[Syrax]], [[Tyraxes]], and [[Vermax]]) to the Greens' four ([[Dreamfyre]], [[Sunfyre]], [[Tessarion]], and [[Vhagar]]), plus several unclaimed and wild dragons residing on Dragonstone. Furthermore, the Blacks have the believed support of the [[Riverlands]] via Lord [[Grover Tully]]'s close friendship to King Viserys. The same is said for both Houses [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|Stark]] and [[House Arryn/House of the Dragon|Arryn]], due to the Starks' long history of honoring oaths and the Arryns' familial connection through the queen's late mother, [[Aemma Arryn]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

The Blacks' cause is significantly boosted when Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] pledges himself, his [[House Velaryon|house]], and his [[Velaryon fleet|fleet]] to Rhaenyra. He subsequently proposes that with the Velaryon fleet, he will [[blockade of the Gullet|blockade the Gullet]] to choke off trade to the capital, a plan readily adopted by Rhaenyra and the Black Council. The Blacks also, at the urging of Princes [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], send the two as envoys to the [[North]], [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], and Stormlands, believing their presence with their dragons will help sway the regions to the Blacks' cause.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

The Blacks are the first to suffer a loss in the Dance, when Prince Lucerys fails in his mission to bring [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]] to their side. Having been beaten to [[Storm's End]] by his half-uncle, Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]], the Blacks' terms are rejected by Lord [[Borros Baratheon]] in favor of the Greens' marriage pact between Aemond and Borros's daughter, Lady [[Floris Baratheon]]. Lucerys subsequently gets into a [[Fight above Shipbreaker Bay|fight]] with Aemond whilst leaving Storm's End, resulting in his and Arrax's death.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Despite the loss of Lucerys and Arrax, the Blacks score a significant diplomatic victory over the Greens when Prince Jacaerys successfully garners the allegiance of the North and the Vale. Lord [[Cregan Stark]] sanctions the supply of 2,000 Northerners to Rhaenyra's cause, while Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]] agrees to lend the support of her house so long as the Blacks provide a dragon to protect the Vale. Additionally, the Blacks' [[blockade of the Gullet]] enters into full effect, putting a significant strain on the capital's economy and the Greens' war effort. Furthermore, while not officially sanctioned nor known by the queen or Black Council, Daemon orders the assassination of Aemond, ultimately resulting in the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|death]] of Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys Targaryen]], King Aegon II's son and heir.{{Ref|HOTD201}} Shortly after Daemon and Rhaenyra had a row on the assassination of Jaehaerys, Daemon traveled to the Riverlands and was able to rally the Riverlords for Rhaenyra.<ref>[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]</ref> The Blacks also score a victory over the Greens regarding Dragons as the Blacks have Dragonriders [[Addam of Hull]]([[Seasmoke]]), [[Hugh]]([[Vermithor]]), and [[Ulf]]([[Silverwing]]). <ref>[[The Queen Who Ever Was]]</ref>

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the Blacks were unofficially formed in 111 AC during the tournament on [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s fifth anniversary. Rhaenyra wore a black and red dress at the opening feast, while Alicent wore green. Ever since, their respective factions at court were known as the "blacks" and the "greens," which were previously called the "party of the princess" and the "queen's party." Supporters of Rhaenyra's claim always wore black and red thereafter, in contrast to Alicent and Aegon's supporters who wore green.
