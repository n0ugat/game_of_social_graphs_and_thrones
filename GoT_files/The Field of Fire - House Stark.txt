==Narration==
'''Robb Stark''': ''The ascension of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] was confirmed; and the fate of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], sealed, on the [[Field of Fire]].''

''Kings [[Loren I Lannister|Loren Lannister]] of the [[Westerlands|Rock]] and [[Mern IX Gardener|Mern Gardener]] of the [[Reach]] stood against [[Aegon's Conquest|Aegon's invasion]]. They commanded a united force of 600 banners, 5,000 mounted [[Knighthood|knights]], and 50,000 [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]].'' 

''Aegon's host was vastly outnumbered, and when the army of the two kings charged, the invaders turned heel and ran. But [[Andals|Andal]] might was no match for dragonflame. When Aegon unleashed all three of his [[dragon]]s, 4,000 souls were horrendously burned alive on the battlefield, King Mern among them. Realizing all hope was lost, King Loren surrendered.''

''The [[House Stark|Starks]] of [[Winterfell]] had no intention of submitting to [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] rule. They had reigned as [[King in the North|Kings in the North]] since the days of the [[First Men]], and were determined to resist the Targaryen invaders, just as they had [[Coming of the Andals|resisted the Andals]] thousands of years before. King [[Torrhen Stark]] led his army to the [[Red Fork]] just east of [[Riverrun]], hoping to succeed where Loren and Mern had failed.''

''But when Torrhen saw the size of Aegon's now mighty host along with his monstrous dragons, he knew he couldn't subject his followers to the horror of another field of fire. He [[Bending the knee|bent the knee]], and swore fealty to Aegon, who allowed the Starks to maintain their [[lordship]] over the [[North|region]] as [[Lord Paramount|Lords Paramount]] and [[Warden of the North|Wardens of the North]].''

''Without question, Torrhen Stark saved thousands of lives that day. He was ever after known as "the King Who Knelt."''
