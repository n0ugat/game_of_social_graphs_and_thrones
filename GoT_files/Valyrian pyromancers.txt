'''Valyrian pyromancers'''{{Ref|HOTD104}} were [[Magic|mages]] from the [[Valyrian Freehold]] whose expertise lie in fire.

==History==
A hundred years after the [[Doom of Valyria]], in the time of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], there were very few Valyrian pyromancers left. Aegon had them hide "[[The Song of Ice and Fire]]" prophecy in the blade of a [[Valyrian steel dagger]].<ref name="King">"[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the term "Valyrian pyromancer" isn't specifically used, but it is said that mages of [[Old Valyria]] could shape stone with fire magic, an art now lost. It is a possibility that [[Valyrian steel]] was forged in the same way.
