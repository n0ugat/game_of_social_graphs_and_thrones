{{Quote|Lord Walder is well, my lady. He has requested the honor of your father's presence on his ninetieth nameday; he intends to take another wife.|The Frey knight to [[Catelyn Stark]]|Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things}}
A '''Frey knight''' visited the [[Inn at the Crossroads]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
He is drinking with companions at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrives on his way south. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], who is also present in the inn, turns to the present knights from the [[Riverlands]] to help her to take Tyrion into custody, accusing him of attempting to murder her son [[Bran Stark|Bran]]. She asserts her origin as a daughter of [[House Tully]], and then tells the knight that she knows his sigil and asks after Lord [[Walder Frey]]. He reports that Lord Frey is about to celebrate his ninetieth name day and has invited Lord [[Hoster Tully]]. Catelyn announces that she will return Tyrion to [[Winterfell]] to await the King's justice. The knight draws his sword and threatens Tyrion, along with the other soldiers loyal to the Tullys.{{Ref|GOT104}} Unlike the other men from the inn, he does not escort Catelyn further.{{Ref|GOT105}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is a large group of Frey men-at-arms in the inn, and Catelyn addresses the Captain of the group. The Freys do not act as Catelyn requests: two of them stir, but sit back down quick enough when the captain does not move.
