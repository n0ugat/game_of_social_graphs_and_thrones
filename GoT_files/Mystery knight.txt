{{Dialogue a-b|Rhaenyra|A mystery knight?|Alicent|No, a Cole of the Stormlands.|Rhaenyra Targaryen and Alicent Hightower|The Heirs of the Dragon}}
A '''mystery knight'''{{Ref|HOTD101}} is a participant in a [[tournament]] who keeps his identity secret. One such combatant was the [[Knight of the Laughing Tree]], who fought in the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Having never heard of his house nor seen his arms, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] mistakes Ser [[Criston Cole]] for a mystery knight.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
[[Brienne of Tarth]] flicks through the ''[[Book of Brothers]]'', in which Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]]{{Note|The paragraph mentioning this event is erroneously placed in Arthur Dayne's entry. The opening sentence calling him the "thirdborn son to Lord Symon of House Gaunt" makes it apparent that this paragraph was meant for Gwayne Gaunt's entry.}} is recorded as having defeated and unmasked the Mystery Knight of [[Bitterbridge]], revealing him to be Ser [[Harlan Grandison]] of the [[Kingsguard]]. It also says that Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] was unmasked by Prince [[Duncan Targaryen]].{{Ref|GOT806}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are several known mystery knights:

*Jonquil Darke, masked as the "Serpent in Scarlet" in the War of the White Cloaks.
*Prince [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon Targaryen]], masked as the "Silver Fool" at [[Old Oak]].
*Prince [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon Targaryen]], masked as the "Knight of Tears."
*Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], masked as the "Gallows Knight" at [[Whitewalls]].
*Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], at [[Blackhaven]] at the age of 10 and six years later at [[King's Landing]].
*[[Simon Toyne]], at [[Storm's End]].
*The Bastard of [[Uplands]], masked as "Blackshield" at [[Oldtown]].
*The Knight of the Laughing Tree, at [[Harrenhal]].

Despite the terminology, a mystery knight is not necessarily a real [[Knighthood|knight]].
