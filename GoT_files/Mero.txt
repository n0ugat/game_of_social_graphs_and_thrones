'''Mero''' was a [[Braavos]]i [[Mercenary|sellsword]] known as '''the Titan's Bastard''' and one of the captains of the [[Second Sons]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Mero is one of the captains of the company of sellswords known as the Second Sons. He hails from the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Braavos]]. His nickname, "the Titan's Bastard", makes reference to the [[Titan of Braavos]], the enormous statue that guards the harbor entrance to the city.{{Ref|GOT308}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Along with his co-captain [[Prendahl na Ghezn]] and a lieutenant, [[Daario Naharis]], he meets [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] in her tent outside Yunkai but snubs her offer to fight for her on the premise that the Second Sons already had a contract with [[Yunkai]]. After aiming several lewd comments at Daenerys, which offend Daenerys's bodyguards so much that [[Grey Worm]] offers to cut Mero's tongue out, and groping [[Missandei]], he leads the Second Sons out of her tent with a barrel of wine as a token of her willingness to work with them. Despite putting up with his insults while in his presence, the moment he is gone Daenerys orders [[Barristan Selmy]] to kill Mero first if their armies come to battle, to which Barristan replies he will be glad to do so.{{Ref|GOT308}}

Mero is next seen back at his camp discussing Daenerys with Daario and Prendahl while groping a [[Yunkai'i whore|Yunkish bedslave]] on his lap. They eventually decide to assassinate her. Mero gives the Yunkish slave three coins to hand out at random to the three Second Sons to decide which of them should do the deed – Daario winds up with the Braavosi coin, leaving the task to him. Later that night, Daario enters Daenerys's tent and produces Mero's head, along with that of Prendahl, and pledges the Second Sons to her cause.{{Ref|GOT308}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mero's background is the same. He is described as having pale green eyes and a bushy red beard. He is the captain of the Second Sons, though under his leadership the Second Sons' reputation has fallen to the point where none of the [[Free Cities]] will hire him any longer.

In the books, as the Second Sons are a separate company from the Stormcrows – to which Daario Naharis and Prendahl na Ghezn belong – Mero is not killed by Daario, instead he flees when the Stormcrows go over to Daenerys and attack the Yunkish forces.

Later, after disguising himself among the freedmen by shaving off his hair and beard, Mero attempts to kill Daenerys, but is stopped by Barristan Selmy (still disguised as "Arstan Whitebeard"). Selmy fights Mero off with a staff, breaking his jaw and right leg; when Mero collapses from his injuries, he is promptly set upon and killed by an enraged mob of freedmen.
