{{Quote|The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals and bring supplies from the South. Not so heroic, I know, but since the Night's Watch doesn't starve or freeze, I guess we're the only order that still does everything it's supposed to.|[[Samwell Tarly]]|The Wall}}
'''Steward''' is a position within the [[Night's Watch]]. They are tasked with keeping the order supplied and undertaking domestic and support duties.

Stewards generally do not serve a combat role, typically do not join in [[Ranger|rangings]], and are not considered authorities on the structure of the [[Wall]] itself. In practice, however, stewards can join in major battles if necessary, can accompany rangers in a support role on [[great ranging]]s,<ref>"[[Fire and Blood]]"</ref> and can also be assigned to sentry duty on top of the Wall.<ref>"[[Mockingbird]]"</ref>

The stewards collectively report to the [[First Steward]], who in turn reports to the [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]].
