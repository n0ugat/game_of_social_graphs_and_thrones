In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, sphinxes are legendary creatures that are said to speak in riddles. Valyrians also had their own version of sphinxes, though these had a dragon's body instead of lion's. Statues in the shape of Valyrian sphinxes are still found on [[Essos]], a relic of times previous to the [[Doom of Valyria]]. The entrance to the chambers of the [[Small Council]] in the [[Red Keep]] is also flanked by two Valyrian sphinxes.

Among the treasures that [[Euron Greyjoy]] has plundered and gathered during his journeys there are ancient Valyrian sphinxes. 

In real life, the term "sphinx" refers to a creature from ancient Greek mythology with the body of a lion, the wings of a raptor, and the head and breasts of a woman. The term was applied to similar creatures from older ancient Egyptian art with the body of a lion and the head of a human, ram, or raptor (but usually no wings).
