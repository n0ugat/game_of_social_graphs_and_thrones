The '''Rainwood'''{{Ref|H&L314}} is a great forest in the [[Stormlands]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Rainwood is a large forest that lies on Cape Wrath in the Stormlands. Although it is rainy, the region is fertile enough. [[Mistwood]] is located in the southern rainwood, while [[Rain House]] is found in its northeast.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', Ser Dermot of the Rainwood is pardoned by King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] after the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

[[Davos Seaworth|Davos]], when proclaimed [[Hand of the King]] to [[Stannis Baratheon]], also gained the title Lord of the Rainwood.

In "Arianne II" sample chapter of the upcoming sixth novel, Arianne Martell and her companions pass through the Rainwood; they find a cave containing stone carving of faces, presumably of the [[Children of the Forest]].
