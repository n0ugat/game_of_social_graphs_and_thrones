{{Quote|Brave men didn't kill dragons, the brave men rode them.|[[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]] to [[Doreah]]|Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things}}
A '''dragonrider'''{{Ref|HOTD102}} was an individual who was able to bond with and mount a [[dragon]]. The [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] were the only surviving house of the [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] [[dragonlord]]s, making them the last known dragonriders.

The histories of the [[Valyrian Freehold]] claim that dragons will accept only [[Valyrians]] of pure [[dragonlord]] lineage as their riders, though [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] believed this may have been false propaganda; on that basis he proposed to call for potential dragonriders from houses besides the Targaryens to aid the [[Blacks]] in the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD205}} The [[Night King]] was able to mount [[Viserion]] despite not bonding with him by reanimating his corpse and enslaving him as a [[wight]].{{Ref|GOT707}}

With the deaths of the Night King and [[Daenerys Targaryen]], there are no active dragonriders. [[Jon Snow]], the only living Targaryen, was able to ride [[Rhaegal]], but the latter's death has left him mountless.

==Abilities==
Dragons cannot be truly "tamed", but they can be bonded with and trained. The [[Valyrians]] rode dragons for millennia. [[Aegon I Targaryen]] and his [[Incest|sister]]-[[Marriage|wives]], who descended from Old Valyria, used the last three dragons in the world to [[Aegon's Conquest|conquer and unify]] the [[Seven Kingdoms]].

Dragons are fairly intelligent animals, and like a horse or a dog, they can be trained by their rider to respond to basic voice commands. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] claims that dragons are intelligent, much more so than most people and will quickly recognize friend from foe. If they are not trained they will quickly lay waste to anything around them. The key to training dragons is making sure they are well fed, a dragon with a full stomach is more obedient.
Since they cannot be truly tamed, dragons can be very dangerous even to their riders. However, they can form very strong bonds with their riders and will show affection and trust towards them. They will even nuzzle their riders, hoping to be petted.

Daenerys has trained her three dragons to respond to vocal commands in her mother tongue of [[High Valyrian]]. She often uses the command "Dracarys" (Valyrian for "dragonfire"), to which her dragons respond by instantly breathing fire and burning anything in their path.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
The dragons fly to [[Dragonstone]] and explore the [[Dragonstone (island)|island]] as Daenerys enters the castle. Their arrival marks the first time in over a century that dragons have flown the skies of Westeros.<ref>[[Dragonstone (episode)]]</ref> Daenerys agrees not to use the dragons on a direct attack on [[King's Landing]] to avoid bloodshed.<ref>"[[Stormborn]]"</ref> After losing the [[Ironborn]] and [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] fleets, [[Highgarden]], and [[Casterly Rock]], Daenerys decides to ride Drogon to ambush the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] and [[House Tarly|Tarly ]] army. For the first time in over a century, a dragon has been used in warfare in Westeros and has ended the battle quickly, but Drogon is hit by a [[scorpion]] bolt and is injured.<ref>"[[The Spoils of War]]"</ref>

Daenerys rides Drogon, followed by Rhaegal and Viserion, to save [[Jon Snow]] and [[Jorah Mormont]] during the [[wight hunt]]. The dragons burn many wights and Drogon lands to flee with the survivors. The [[Night King]] kills Viserion in flight, causing Daenerys to flee with Drogon and Rhaegal, leaving Jon behind.<ref>"[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"</ref> 

Daenerys rides Drogon, followed by Rhaegal to the [[Dragonpit Summit]], as a show of power. This proves to be a mistake, as [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] notices Viserion's absence and finds out that the dragons are vulnerable. Daenerys later decides not to ride Drogon north; instead, she sails with Jon to reaffirm that they are allies to the common people of the North.<ref name="E67">"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref> 

[[Beyond the Wall]], the Night King has reanimated Viserion as a wight. The Night King rides Viserion, who now has no free will and is controlled by the Night King.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Daenerys allows Jon to mount Rhaegal.<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref> During the [[Battle of Winterfell]], Daenerys and Jon mount Drogon and Rhaegal and burn thousands of wights. Mounted on their dragons, Daenerys and Jon fight the Night King and Viserion, who greatly injures Rhaegal, causing him to fall unconscious. Daenerys forces the Night King off Viserion and attempts to burn him, but to her surprise he is undamaged. Daenerys is later dismounted off Drogon when hundreds of wights climb on him, causing him to shriek in pain as he attempts to shake them off. The Night King is killed by [[Arya Stark]], killing one of three dragonriders alive.<ref>"[[The Long Night]]"</ref>

Following the Battle of Winterfell, Daenerys checks the wounds of Rhaegal, who is now healing, and rides Drogon alongside him. Later Daenerys on top of Drogon, followed by Rhaegal, follows her fleet to Dragonstone. Flying alongside Rhaegal, Daenerys is happy to see Rhaegal recovering from his wounds, but to her surprise Rhaegal is shot with three scorpion bolts from [[Euron Greyjoy]] new frigate, killing him. Daenerys in shock and rage attempts to burn the Greyjoy fleet, before being forced to retreat as she mourns Rhaegal's loss. With the death of Rhaegal, Daenerys is the last living dragonrider.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref>

Daenerys, mounted on Drogon, ambushes Euron's fleet during the [[Battle of King's Landing]], and burns all scorpions. As the [[Unsullied]], Dothraki, [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], and [[Northmen|Northern]] armies wait outside the gates of King's Landing, Daenerys destroys them, allowing them to enter the city. In grief over the loss of her two dragons, along with Jorah and [[Missandei]], Daenerys refuses the surrender of the city and [[Targaryen madness|mercilessly burns much of it and its population]].<ref>"[[The Bells]]"</ref>

Having won the war and the throne, Daenerys dismounts Drogon and rallies her army, telling them that the war is not over. Daenerys is later [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassinated by Jon]], thus the last dragonrider is killed. Drogon mourns over her and burns the Iron Throne to slag before taking her body away with him.<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, additional known dragonriders are:

According to Daenerys, no dragonrider ever flew two dragons; even Aegon the Conqueror never dared mount Vhagar or Meraxes, nor did his sisters ride Balerion. Since dragons live longer than people, after a dragonrider dies - his/her dragon may bond with another person (''A Dance with Dragons'', Daenerys VIII).
