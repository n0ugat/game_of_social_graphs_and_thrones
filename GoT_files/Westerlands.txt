The '''Westerlands''',{{Ref|GOT105}} also known simply as the '''West''',{{Ref|GOT108}} is one of the constituent regions of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Prior to [[Aegon's Conquest]], it was a sovereign realm known as the '''Kingdom of the Rock'''.{{Ref|H&L102}}

The Westerlands are ruled from the castle of [[Casterly Rock]] by [[House Lannister]]. It is one of the smaller regions of the Seven Kingdoms geographically but has one of the larger populations.  It is also immensely rich in natural resources, particularly metals. Predominantly mountainous, the hills of the Westerlands are riddled with veins of gold and silver, the mining of which has made the Lannisters and their bannermen immensely rich; the abundance of iron also allows them to easily forge weapons and military equipment. While the Lannister armies are not as huge as those of the Reach, they are the best-equipped in the realm with heavily-armored soldiers and cavalry.

[[Bastard]]s born in the Westerlands are given the surname Hill. People of the Westerlands are collectively known as Westermen and are referred to, colloquially, as "lions" in reference to the sigil of House Lannister. Colloquially, Westermen are also referred to as Lannisters.

The seat of the Lannister's power for generations, Casterly Rock, for the first time in its history, fell to an invading army during the [[Last War]]. Utilizing a secret passageway constructed by [[Tyrion Lannister]], the Unsullied armies of [[Daenerys Targaryen]] infiltrated and captured the castle. Though the Lannisters had deliberately left the Rock underdefended so as to focus their attention on capturing the Tyrell stronghold of [[Highgarden]] and were intending to take it back later, their armies were in turn smashed by Daenerys at the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], thus leaving the Unsullied in control of the castle. Despite Casterly Rock being captured by the Unsullied, the Westerlands still remained under complete Lannister control, as [[Jaime Lannister]] was seen discussing troop and supply movements in the Westerlands with his generals even after the castle's capture. The Unsullied would later abandon Casterly Rock to participate in [[Battle of Winterfell|battles]] in the [[North]], and with the destruction of the remaining Lannister forces during the [[Battle of King's Landing]] and the death of [[Cersei Lannister]], lordship of both House Lannister and Casterly Rock was passed on to Tyrion.

==Geography==
The Westerlands border the [[Riverlands]] to the east and the [[Reach]] to the south. The Goldroad links Lannisport on Westeros's west coast with the capital city of [[King's Landing]] on the east coast, passing through the Reach, skirting south of the Riverlands. The Searoad, hugging the coast, links Lannisport with the capital of the Reach at [[Highgarden]] as well as the major city of [[Oldtown]] further south. Predominantly mountainous, the Westerlands are well-defended from external attack. There is only one major pass through the mountains in the east of the Westerlands, near the headwaters of the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]]. Thus there is only one narrow and predictable path that armies moving between the Westerlands and Riverlands can normally take and it is guarded by the castle of Golden Tooth.

The Westerlands border on the waters of Ironman's Bay to the north, and thus are under threat of [[Ironborn]] attacks along the coasts. House Lannister commonly keeps a large fleet of warships to defend against these attacks (thus the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] began with a sneak attack which burned the Lannister fleet at anchor). Apart from its mountainous terrain, the Westerlands are also somewhat better defended from Ironborn attacks because they possesses few major rivers which empty into the west coast; this is in contrast with the Reach, which while further south from the Iron Islands, possesses major rivers such as the [[Mander]] which are navigable for a long distance inland.

The headwaters of the Red Fork of the Trident originate in the Westerlands' eastern border but do not run through much of it before passing into the Riverlands to the east. The only major river in the Westerlands is in the north, where the Tumblestone river flows east. Ultimately, the Tumblestone passes into the Riverlands where it joins the Red Fork coming up from the south at [[Riverrun]].

==Military strength==
[[File:Lannister_soldier.jpg|thumb||160px|A man-at-arms from the Westerlands.]]
The Westerlands' men-at-arms seem to be the only soldiers, along with the Vale and Reach men-at-arms, that value the usage of plate armor the most; their arms and torso are covered by crimson-ornamented plate, while their heads are protected by helmets with collapsible visors, cheek guards and golden crests. Some other low-ranking soldiers have their torso armed with only red robes and leather cuirasses. Officers, generals, and lords often utilize intricate lion-styled pauldrons and crimson capes to denote their rank and status. 

The Westerlands are among the most powerful regions in Westeros. In large part due to its large population and the wealth of House Lannister, the Westerlands can quickly raise significant military forces, less than the [[Reach]] but more than the [[North]], the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], the [[Riverlands]], and the [[Stormlands]]. At the beginning of the War of the Five Kings, [[Tywin Lannister]] easily raises approximately 60,000 men of the Westerlands in a relatively short period of time, though it is not mentioned how many of those troops belong directly to House Lannister.<ref>"[[You Win or You Die]]"</ref> 

A long series of battles and major defeats against the armies of [[Robb Stark]], [[Stannis Baratheon]], and later [[Daenerys Targaryen]], have greatly decreased the Westerlands' manpower, with half of the 60,000 troops raised at the start of the war being destroyed in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]] alone. By Season 7, House Lannister is mentioned to have about 10,000 soldiers,<ref>"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref> with most of these troops later being wiped out in the [[Battle of the Goldroad]] and the [[Battle of King's Landing]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Westerlands consist of a landscape of hills and valleys stretching from the well-watered [[Riverlands]] in the east to the sea in the north and west and to the fertile plains of the [[Reach]] to the south.
