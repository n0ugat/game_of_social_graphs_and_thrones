An historical member of the house, Myles Smallwood, was a [[Hand of the King]] ​who was renowned for his courage.  He was a disaster as the Hand and now a warning to those who become Hands.

During the [[War of the Five Kings]], House Smallwood follows their liege lord against [[House Lannister]], while Lady Ravella sends Carellen to her great-aunt at a motherhouse in [[Oldtown]]. Acorn Hall, in the meantime, serves as safe haven for the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].

Smallwood men are present at the camps outside the [[Twins]] prior to the [[Red Wedding]]; following the massacre, Lord Theomar is among the Riverlords who bend the knee to the [[Iron Throne]].
