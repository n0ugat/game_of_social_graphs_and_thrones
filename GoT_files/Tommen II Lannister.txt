'''Tommen II Lannister''' was a member of [[House Lannister]] who ruled the [[Westerlands]] as [[King of the Rock]].

==Biography==
Tommen Lannister, the Second of His Name, ruled the [[Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]] after the [[Doom of Valyria]]. He led an expedition to the [[Valyrian peninsula]], to loot whatever treasures had survived the Doom. He never returned. He carried with him the [[Valyrian steel]] sword [[Brightroar]], which was lost with him.{{Ref|H&L415}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, King Tommen II is briefly mentioned. In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' his story is briefly expanded. The last report of him is a [[Volantis|Volantene]] chronicle titled ''The Glory of Volantis'' which mentions a "golden fleet" bearing the "Lion King" stayed at Volantis for supplies, and that the [[Triarchs of Volantis|triarchs]] showered him with gifts. According to the chronicle, Tommen II swore that half of all he would find would be given to the triarchs in return for their generosity and the promise to send their fleet to his aid when he requested it. Afterward he sailed away. The next year, the chronicle states that Triarch Marqelo Tagaros dispatched a squadron toward Valyria to find any sign of Tommen's golden fleet, but returned empty handed.

Tommen II apparently lived a few years or few decades after the Doom of Valyria, which was itself a century before [[Aegon's Conquest]] of [[Westeros]]. It is said that the Lannisters acquired Brightroar in the century before the Doom, and that Tommen II disappeared a little over a century after that.
