==''Game of Thrones'' main theme==

[[File:Main Title Theme.wav|right]]
The ''Game of Thrones'' is the overarching theme of the series, and of the ''[[World of Westeros]]'' franchise as a whole.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kxi6ChQjuFk</ref>

===Composition===
{{ReferencesSection}}
[[Ramin Djawadi]] began composing the music for the show after he had watched the first two episodes of the series that the showrunners [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] had sent him, and discussed the concepts of the show with them. According to Djawadi, the show creators wanted the main title theme to invoke the sense of journey as there are many locations and characters in the show and involves much traveling. After Djawadi had seen the preliminary animated title sequence that the visual effect artists were still working on, he was inspired to write the piece. Djawadi said that he intended to capture the overall impression of the show with the theme. The cello is featured strongly as Benioff and Weiss wanted to avoid the flutes or solo vocals found in many other productions in the fantasy genre so as to give the show a distinctive sound, and Djawadi chose cello as the main instrument for the music as he thought it had a "darker sound" that suited the show.

Djawadi started with a riff and he built the title theme around the riff. The tune begins with the riff played on strings in C minor, then modulating to C major after 2 measures, and back to minor again. Djawadi said that he wanted to reflect the "backstabbing and conspiracy" and the unpredictability of the show: "''I thought it would be cool to kinda do the same play with the music. So even though the majority of the piece is in minor, there's that little hint of major in there where it kinda switches and then it changes back again.''" The main theme is then introduced with the cello, joined later by a solo violin that may suggest an interplay between different characters. The melody is then repeated with the entire violin section. The next section introduces a change in melody, described by Djawadi as giving "a sense of adventure," and continues with a repeat that involves a choir of twenty female voices. The title theme ends with a combination of dulcimer and kantele, producing a "shimmery quality" in its sound that Djawadi thought would give a sense of mystery and anticipation for the episode.

The title music is reprised as a global theme in the soundtracks for the series. It may be played occasionally on its own in fragments, sometimes as part of the theme of individual characters or in combination with other pieces of music, and may also be played in large section during particularly important scenes.

A rendition of "The Children" was used in the DVD and Blu-Ray menus for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]] boxset, tying together the themes of Arya, [[House Stark]], and the main title theme.

===Appearances===
Technically, this theme appears in every episode because it is part of the intro music. This table of appearances only shows when it has been used in the episode itself.
