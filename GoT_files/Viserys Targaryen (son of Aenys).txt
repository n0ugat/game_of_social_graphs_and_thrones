==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Viserys was the second son of King Aenys. He was promising and beloved of the commons.

In 44 AC, Viserys was taken hostage by King [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor I]] (though officially he was the king's squire) to stop his mother from giving her support to any attempts to overthrow Maegor. The king had him tortured to death by his Mistress of Whispers [[Tyanna of the Tower|Tyanna]] when his mother Alyssa fled [[Dragonstone]] with [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] and [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]] after [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]]'s death, hoping to discover if Viserys knew his mother and siblings' whereabouts. Afterward, his body was left in the courtyard of the [[Red Keep]] for a fortnight in hopes of luring his mother out of hiding to demand Viserys be given a proper funeral. When Alyssa failed to take the bait, Maegor ordered Viserys's body cremated.

When Viserys's younger brother Jaehaerys became king, one of his first acts was to have the jailers and torturers who'd aided Tyanna in torturing Viserys executed. Alyssa was then presented with a chest containing the severed heads and hands of her son's killers, declaring herself well pleased that justice had been done.
