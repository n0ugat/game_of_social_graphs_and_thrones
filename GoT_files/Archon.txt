The '''Archon'''{{Ref|H&L215}} is the ruler of the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Tyrosh]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Archon of Tyrosh is elected by powerful [[Magister]]s of the city. In some generations, the Archon can be little more than a figurehead for Tyrosh's magisters - similar to how the [[Prince of Pentos]] is ''always'' just a figurehead for the council of magisters in [[Pentos]]. Unlike Pentos, however, in other generations the Archon can actually be quite powerful and bring the magisters of the city to heel under him - it has varied considerably over the centuries with the tide of local politics.
