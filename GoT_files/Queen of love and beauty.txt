The '''queen of love and beauty'''{{Ref|GOT806}} is a tradition held in tourneys in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Sansa Stark]] visits the statue of her aunt [[Lyanna Stark]] in the crypt at [[Winterfell]], lighting a candle in the statue's hand. Sansa is joined by [[Petyr Baelish]], her recently widowed uncle by marriage, who recalls what happened at the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]] where [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] shocked everyone present by passing over his [[Elia Martell|wife]] in order to crown Lyanna as the queen of love and beauty. Baelish concludes his story by noting how this seemingly sweet gesture led to [[Robert's Rebellion|deaths of thousands]].<ref>"[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
While [[Brienne of Tarth]] writes [[Jaime Lannister]]'s deeds within the ''[[Book of Brothers]]'', it is mentioned that [[Alys Reyne]] was crowned as queen of love and beauty by [[Gwayne Gaunt]]{{Note|The paragraph mentioning this event is erroneously placed in Arthur Dayne's entry. The opening sentence calling him the "thirdborn son to Lord Symon of House Gaunt" makes it apparent that this paragraph was meant for Gwayne Gaunt's entry.|name=Gwayne Gaunt}} in the tourney of [[Brightwater Keep]].<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==Known Queens of Love and Beauty==
*[[Alys Reyne]], named by Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]]{{Note|name=Gwayne Gaunt}} at [[Brightwater Keep]].
*[[Lyanna Stark]], named by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] at [[Harrenhal]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the tradition holds that the victor in a tournament may select any woman present and name her the queen of love and beauty, crowning her with a wreath of flowers and dedicating his victory to her.

The victorious knight often chooses a woman he loves or intends to court, and it can be a source of scandal if the victor crowns a woman already bound to another man, or if a married man crowns someone other than his wife. Since both of these cases were true when Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] crowned [[Lyanna Stark]] after winning a tourney at [[Harrenhal]], it was particularly scandalous.

Queen [[Naerys Targaryen]] was crowned by her brother, Prince [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]], who was disguised as a mystery knight known as the "Knight of Tears". Queen Naerys was married to King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]].

Princess [[Rhaella Targaryen]] was crowned by Ser Bonifer Hasty, a [[Knighthood|landed knight]] of the [[Stormlands]].

Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] crowned [[Lynesse Hightower (daughter of Leyton)|Lynesse Hightower]] after winning a tourney at [[Lannisport]], requesting and receiving her hand in marriage from her father that very night.
