'''Iwan Rheon'''{{Note|"Iwan" is a Gaelic name and is pronounced "Yew-en"; like ''Star Wars'' actor Ewan McGregor (who uses a variant spelling).}} is a Welsh actor and musician. He portrays [[Ramsay Bolton]] in ''Game of Thrones''.

==Career==
Rheon had a lead role in ''Misfits'' (which also featured [[Josef Altin]], [[Michelle Fairley]] and [[Nathalie Emmanuel]]). He is in the upcoming movies ''Wasteland'' and ''Libertador''. He also had a recurring role in the first and second seasons of Simon Amstell's sitcom ''Grandma's House'' as Simon's self-involved boyfriend, Ben.

He was cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' in the role of [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]]. He was announced in the role on July 20, 2012, though the character was initially referred only as "Boy", to keep his identity secret.<ref name="WiC Iwan">[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/07/iwan-rheon-cast-in-game-of-thrones/ "Iwan Rheon cast in Game of Thrones"], Winter is Coming.net, July 20, 2012</ref> He was promoted to starring cast member for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth]] season, and his name was added to the opening credits as of "[[The Lion and the Rose]]".

In the DVD commentary for Season 3 episode 3 "[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]", executive producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] revealed that Iwan was actually their runner-up second choice to play [[Jon Snow]], one of the main ''heroes'' of the story, but lost to [[Kit Harington]]. In many ways, Ramsay Snow is a foil to Jon Snow: just as the Boltons are the "bad" counterpart to the "good" Starks in the North, both of them are the bastard sons of the head of their Houses. [[Bryan Cogman]] later said that when Benioff and Weiss conceived the show's version of Ramsay, Rheon was their first and only choice for the role.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/cogman-tweets-anon/ ]</ref>

Rheon and Harington are close friends in real life, but did not share screen time until the sixth season episode, "[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]". While filming Jon and Ramsay's fight scene, Rheon was accidentally struck twice by Harington, who first caught Rheon's chin with a shield and then punched him across the face. Though Rheon was not seriously hurt, Harington reportedly bought him a pint of beer as a sign of apology.

Rheon reprised his role as Ramsay in ''[[Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series]]'', along with Harington, [[Lena Headey]], [[Peter Dinklage]], [[Emilia Clarke]], and [[Natalie Dormer]].

In 2015, he co-starred in the TV series ''Residue'' alongside [[Natalia Tena]], who played [[Osha]] in ''Game of Thrones''.
