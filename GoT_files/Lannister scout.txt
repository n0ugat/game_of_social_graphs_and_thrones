A '''Lannister scout''' is a scout in service to [[House Lannister]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
He is captured by the forces of [[House Stark]]. [[Robb Stark|Robb]] interrogates him and learns that he has overestimated the size of the Stark army as 20,000 men. Robb feigns mercy and lets him go in order to trick [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] into thinking 20,000 [[Northmen]] were marching to the [[Green Fork]] against his army, when in actuality Robb sent only 2,000 men. The deception assists Robb to defeat Jaime's troops in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]].{{Ref|GOT108}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, this character has no equivalent.

Prior to the battle in the Whispering Wood, the Lannisters sent scouts to spy on the Stark host, but those scouts either vanished (presumably killed by Marq Piper) or claimed that they saw nothing.
