{{Quote|You've been to Ashemark?|[[Jaime Lannister]]|Valar Morghulis}}
'''Ashemark'''{{Ref|GOT210}} is a stronghold in the [[Westerlands]]. It is the seat of [[House Marbrand]], a noble house sworn to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. It is located close to where the [[Tumblestone]] river begins, southeast of the [[Crag]] and northeast of Casterly Rock.

==Behind the scenes==
*Ashemark is misspelled as "Ashmark" on the [[Painted Table]].<ref>"[[Stormborn]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ashemark is the seat of House Marbrand.

After the [[Battle of Oxcross]] opened up the northern Westerlands to [[Robb Stark]]'s army, his forces easily captured Ashemark. For some reason, the TV series doesn't refer to a minor engagement at the "Battle of Ashemark", instead referring to a [[battle at the Yellow Fork]] taking place around the same point. It seems that they changed the name to avoid confusion with [[Ashford]], which is a castle in the Reach. It is possible that the "Yellow Fork" is meant to be the tributary of the Tumblestone, which is itself a tributary of the [[Trident]] River system, with its three main forks also named after colors: [[Red Fork|Red]], [[Blue Fork|Blue]], and [[Green Fork|Green]].
