The '''Storm King''',{{Ref|H&L102}} or '''King of the Stormlands''',{{Ref|C&R04}} was the ruler of the [[Stormlands]] when it was a sovereign kingdom. They ruled from the [[Age of Heroes]] until the [[Aegon I Targaryen|Targaryen]] conquest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]].

The legendary first Storm King, [[Durran Godsgrief]], lived during the Age of Heroes and belonged to the [[First Men]] ethnic group. During the [[coming of the Andals]], they conquered the [[Stormlands]] but the title of "Storm King" remained.

During [[Aegon's Conquest]], the last Storm King of the [[House Durrandon|Durrandon]] dynasty, [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]], was killed in [[Last Storm|battle]] by [[Aegon I Targaryen]]'s bastard half-brother [[Orys Baratheon]], who thereafter claimed Argilac's seat at the castle [[Storm's End]], his sigil, his words, and his [[Argella Baratheon|daughter]], founding [[House Baratheon]].
