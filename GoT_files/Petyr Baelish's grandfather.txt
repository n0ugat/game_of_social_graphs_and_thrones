{{Quote|My grandfather raised himself to the status of hedge knight and even managed to acquire a bit of land and a keep on the smallest of the Fingers, though I do believe he often missed sleeping under his titular hedges.|[[Petyr Baelish]]|House Baelish (short)}}
'''Petyr Baelish's grandfather''' was a [[hedge knight]].

==Biography==
He was a poor wandering [[hedge knight]], who eventually was rewarded for his services with a small portion of land and a keep - a tiny, hardscrabble holding in the smallest peninsula of the [[Fingers]].{{Ref|H&L402}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Littlefinger's grandfather (his first name is not mentioned) was a landless hedge knight. His own father was born in [[Braavos]] and came to the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] as a sellsword in the hire of Lord [[House Corbray|Corbray]], so Littlefinger's grandfather took the head of the [[Titan of Braavos]] as his sigil when he was [[Knighthood|knighted]]. His arms were a grey stone head with fiery eyes on a light green field.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', when Littlefinger and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] arrive at the [[Fingers]], Littlefinger shows Sansa the shield and briefly speaks about his grandfather and great-grandfather.
