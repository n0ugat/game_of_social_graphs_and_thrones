No stranger to gritty medieval set pieces, Vansittart is well known for appearing in the 1994 film ''Braveheart'' (alongside [[James Cosmo]]) as Lord Bottoms, the English lord who goes to Scotland and asserts the right of ''prima noctis'' (First Night) over the local Scots, sparking off a Scottish rebellion. Vansittart is also known for his performances on British television, appearing in series such as ''Doctor Who'', ''The Bill'', ''Mr. Bean'' and ''The Thin Blue Line'' (a series that also featured [[Mark Addy]], [[Ben Crompton]] and [[Owen Teale]], with Teale featuring in the same episode as Vansittart). He has also appeared in numerous British films such as ''Four Weddings and a Funeral'', ''The Iron Lady'' and ''Johnny English Reborn''.
