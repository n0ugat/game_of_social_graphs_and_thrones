The '''Prince of Pentos'''{{Ref|HOTD106}} is the nominal ruler of the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Pentos]]. He is chosen by the [[Magister]]s of the city from among the Pentoshi noble families.

The Prince supposedly holds the powers of trade, justice, and war, and on every new year he must deflower the [[Maid of the Field]] and the [[Maid of the Seas]] to bring good fortune to the city. However, the title is mostly ceremonial; should a crop fail or a war be lost, the Magisters slit the current Prince's throat and choose a new Prince.<ref>"[[The Free Cities]]"</ref>

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
During the late reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]], [[Reggio Haratis]] was the Prince of Pentos.<ref>"[[The Princess and the Queen]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Prince of Pentos has a mostly ceremonial function and presides over balls and feasts. He rides through the city in a palanquin of ivory and gold, with three heralds before him carrying the Golden Scales of Trade, the Iron Sword of War, and the Silver Scourge of Justice.

It appears that the chosen Prince has no choice if selected. When the Tattered Prince (the leader of the [[Windblown]] mercenary company) was twenty-three, he was chosen almost immediately after the Magisters had beheaded the previous Prince. Instead of taking the mantle and becoming the Magisters' disposable puppet, the young man fled the city never to return.
