'''Dreamfyre'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Ēdrurzys''}} is a [[dragon]] bred by [[House Targaryen]]. She is bonded to [[Helaena Targaryen]], though Helaena rarely rides her.{{Guideref|Dreamfyre}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Dreamfyre hatched during the reign of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], and she grew to become one of the larger and fiercer dragons.{{Ref|HOTD208}} She was claimed by Princess [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena Targaryen]], and after the latter was forcibly married to her own uncle, King [[Maegor Targaryen]], Dreamfyre flew her rider from the [[Red Keep]] to support the claim of her brother Prince [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys Targaryen]].{{Ref|H&L806}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Awaiting the birth of her sibling, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] chooses one of Dreamfyre's eggs to place in the cradle. [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] steals the same egg after he is disinherited.{{Ref|HOTD102}} Dreamfyre eventually bonds with Princess [[Helaena Targaryen]].{{Guideref|Dreamfyre}}

Dreamfyre is guarding a mound of eggs in the [[Dragonpit]] when she is approached by [[Aemond Targaryen]], who is there with the intention of claiming a dragon. Aemond stumbles and runs away when Dreamfyre roars and breathes fire.{{Ref|HOTD106}}{{Note|The dragon is not named in the episode or the script, and the lighting of the scene makes it difficult to identify its true colors, but the [https://darksvster.tumblr.com/post/744405950489903104/excerpts-from-the-house-of-the-dragon script] specifies its coloration as "blue and silver." The only dragon who fits this description is Dreamfyre.}}

Dreamfyre stays at [[High Tide]] along with several other dragons during the funeral of [[Laena Velaryon]]. The next day, she flies back to [[King's Landing]] with [[Helaena Targaryen]] riding her.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] urges Helaena to fly Dreamfyre with him into battle, but she refuses to burn innocent people.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

[[Corlys Velaryon|Corlys]] fears that Helaena will fly Dreamfyre into battle against the [[Blacks]], but [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] refuses to believe that her half-sister is willing to use her dragon as a weapon of war.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', Dreamfyre was hatched at some point prior to the reign of King [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor I Targaryen]], and was ridden by King [[Aenys Targaryen]]'s daughter and eldest child, Princess Rhaena Targaryen.

Dreamfyre's color was primarily light blue, with secondary silver markings. Dreamfyre was referred to as a "she-dragon", because it was confirmed to have laid several clutches of eggs. She was comparatively slender for a dragon - explaining how, despite being near in age, other second generation dragons such as [[Vermithor]] or [[Meleys]] were considered more powerful in combat (even younger ones like [[Caraxes]]).

Rhaena hid with Dreamfyre on [[Fair Isle]] for a time, before being summoned back to King's Landing, where she was forced to marry her own half-uncle Maegor - the man who had just killed her own brother-husband, Prince [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon]]. Rhaena later escaped the Red Keep, however, flying Dreamfyre away - along with the ancestral Targaryen sword [[Blackfyre]], taken from Maegor while he slept. Rhaena and Dreamfyre survived Maegor's death, living at times on Dragonstone, later returning to [[Fair Isle]] for several years, then finally at [[Harrenhal]] until Rhaena's eventual death in 73 AC.

''Fire & Blood'' vaguely implies that Dreamfyre may have been the mother of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s three dragons, though this is unconfirmed. The book does explain how three dragon eggs ended up in the Free Cities: after a longstanding quarrel, Rhaena's lover Elissa Farman stole three dragon eggs from the hatchery on Dragonstone and fled with them to the Free Cities, where she sold them for funds. This does heavily imply that Daenerys's three eggs did ''not'' originate in Asshai but were in fact from the Targaryen lineage of dragons. The exact wording of the text, however, does not specify which dragon laid the eggs that Elissa stole, whether from Dreamfyre or another.
