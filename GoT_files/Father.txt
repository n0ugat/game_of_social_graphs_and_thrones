{{Quote|The Father sits in judgment over souls.|[[Catelyn Stark]]|The Old Gods and the New (Histories & Lore)}}
The '''Father'''{{Ref|GOT208}} ​is an aspect of the [[Seven]]. He represents divine justice, and judges the souls of the dead. As such, he is often depicted holding a set of scales.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Father represents judgment. He is depicted as a bearded man who carries scales. He is prayed to for justice. [[Marriage#Faith of the Seven|Weddings]] are conducted standing between the altars of the Father and the [[Mother]].

While in a nameless village, [[Catelyn Stark]] prays in a sept that is modest and has no statues of the Seven, only rough charcoal drawings to represent them. She prays to the Father for justice, the strength to seek it and the wisdom to know it.
