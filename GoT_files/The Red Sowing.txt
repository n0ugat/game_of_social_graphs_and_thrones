==Synopsis==
===On Driftmark===
On a beach [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] meets the new [[Seasmoke]] rider, [[Addam of Hull]]. Rhaenyra initially stares at him intently as the dragons roar at each other, then she informs him that he stands before the Queen of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], with a dragon of [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]]. Addam humbly replies that he had no designs on it, when Rhaenyra asks him what he wants, he replies that he wants to learn the ways of the dragon riders, and serve his queen, with that he kneels. Rhaenyra, more confident but still cautious, begins to approach him followed by [[Syrax]]. Suddenly Seasmoke roars at her, and Rhaenyra decides to stop. She tells Addam that she bows quickly to a man so suddenly elevated. Addam says that it was the dragon that came to him, not he to him. He says that he has sweated blood serving House Velaryon, and admits that he looks humble, that he knows very well what it means to serve, and says that if the gods call him to greater deeds he cannot refuse. Rhaenyra comes close enough to stand before him and tells him to stand, which Addam does. Rhaenyra asks him about his origins, Addam says that his mother was a shipwright, but his father is "no one of consequence". Rhaenyra asks him if there are any Targaryens among his ancestors, and Addam says that his family keeps no records. Addam introduces himself, and Rhaenyra, trusting him completely, tells him that he has accomplished a feat she feared was impossible, and that she is pleased with it. She asks him if he can lead Seasmoke to [[Dragonstone]], to which Addam replies smilingly, "I can try."

At the shipyard [[Alyn of Hull|Alyn]] is helping load fish when he hears [[Corlys Velaryon|Lord Corlys]] calling him. Corlys motions for him to follow, informs him that he needs him for some errands, tells him that the queen wants boats at [[King's Landing]], tasks him with getting fishing boats and paying what they ask, as long as they have trustworthy captains. Corlys tells him to put trusty swords on board to wait outside the harbor, and that there will be a message for [[Elinda Massey|a person]] "she" will name. He informs Alyn that the queen has found a new rider for one of her dragons, which Alyn claims to know. Corlys then reveals that said rider is his brother Addam, which surprises Alyn. Corlys informs him that he is calling others, and states that "Our people" are of [[Old Valyria]], but are not dragonlords, then confesses that he knows little about his mother's heritage, wondering if "it is something in the blood." Alyn at first hesitantly states that his brother and has always been restless, longing for a sign of his worth, then claims to be "of Salt and Sea" and that he desires nothing more. Corlys, apparently satisfied, motions for him to go, which Alyn does.

===In the Vale of Arryn===
[[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] escorts Rhaenyra's sons as they depart from the [[Eyrie]] to travel to [[Pentos]], but secretly leaves the group to track the [[Sheepstealer|wild dragon]].

===At Harrenhal===
[[Oscar Tully]], the new [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]], arrives with the Riverlords. He proclaims his intention to honor [[Grover Tully|his late grandfather]]'s oath of loyalty to Rhaenyra as [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]'s heir and offers [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] his allegiance. The Riverlords doubt young Oscar's leadership ability and despise Daemon for allowing the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]]' war atrocities against [[House Bracken]].

To appease the other [[Lordship|lords]], Oscar condemns [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Willem Blackwood]]'s savagery, though Willem claims he was doing Daemon's bidding. Oscar dismisses Willem's excuse and declares he must be held accountable. Oscar demands that Daemon prove himself worthy of the Riverlords' banners by showing contrition for his earlier actions and dispensing justice. Daemon agrees and executes Willem. Later, Daemon experiences another vision of Viserys, who says he never wanted the [[crown]] and that it crushes whoever wears it. He asks if Daemon still wants it.

===At Dragonstone===
Rhaenyra returns to Dragonstone with Addam and Seasmoke, watched by a serious [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]]. The council, along with [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]], meets without Rhaenyra. [[Lorent Marbrand]] and [[Gerardys]] arrive. Lorent informs the council that the queen is unharmed, relieving those present. Corlys asks if they know who the knight is, and Gerardys says that he is a carpenter in the employ of Corlys, who is surprised. Bartimos Celtigar tells Corlys that while he "respects" his workers, in his opinion low-borns cannot go around seizing dragons, asking if the "Thief" is under surveillance. Gerardys informs that, by the Queen's will, Addam will remain there as a guest and will be trained in dragonriding and tutored in High Valyrian. Lord Bartimos points out that they know nothing about him except that he is a low-born, asking for advice from Corlys. He states that they will wait to hear from the queen before passing judgment. Jace asks with a shaking voice where the queen is. Ser Lorent informs them that the queen has informed that she will not be present.

Alone [[Mysaria]] and Rhaenyra talk about the situation. Mysaria notes that it is fortunate that Addam serves her and not himself. Rhaenyra thinks that it was somehow ordered, since Seasmoke chose him she is sure that he has some Targaryen blood, now in her the intention to look for other dragonriders for Vermithor and Silverwing has awakened. Mysaria asks if she trusts Addam. Rhaenyra says that she has no choice, since he has a dragon, and that without him she only has Syrax against [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] and her [[Vhagar]]. She wonders where she should look, while thinking, Mysaria chuckles and this is noticed by Rhaenyra, Mysaria apologizes and notes that "you are better served looking under the sheets than in the woodpiles.", she remembers that she worked in a brothel where the Targaryens spent a lot of their time, and she has met their bastards ([[Dragonseed|the Dragonseeds]]) first hand, and that there are some others too, perhaps even in Dragonstone, and who will be as ready to serve her as the lords or ladies and perhaps more, Rhaenyra is hesitant, stating that in the noble houses there is an ancient loyalty and honor, but then Mysaria points out that, while a common shipwright vows to serve her, her royal half-brothers Aegon and Aemond want to destroy her, noting that the order of things has now been turned upside down, Rhaenyra stands and thinks, then remembers that for 20 years the lords of the realm have insulted her children behind her back, and then declares "Well, then. Let us raise an army of bastards.".

As Addam contemplates his chamber at Dragonstone, Corlys enters the room, Addam sees him and bows his head calling him "My lord", Corlys compliments Addam on his feat, Addam asks to be excused from his duty as a shipwright in his service, stating that there are strong men who could replace him, Corlys motions for Addam to be quiet, and grants him permission, then approaches and, smiling slightly, says "Well done." before walking away as Addam smiles.

As Rhaenyra is reading, Jacaerys arrives, asking if allowing the lowborn to claim the dragons was Lady Mysaria's idea, Rhaenyra points out that she was thrilled when [[Steffon Darklyn|Ser Steffon]] tried, with Jace saying that he was the Lord Commander of her Queensguard and the heir to Dun Fort, while they are, with Rhaenyra stating that they are brave, while Jace dismissively says that they are "Monglers", Jace starts to leave but is called back by his mother, she asks him to think about what is at stake, which Jace says he knows well, wondering if, given that House Targaryen and the blood of the dragon, what would become of everyone if they had one, Rhaenyra states that they are the rightful rulers of the Seven Kingdoms, and Jace wonders if one of the dragonseeds dragonriders would decide to rule the Seven Kingdoms, wondering if the Conqueror's dream had foretold it, so Rhaenyra asks him what he would like her to do, to which Jace cannot answer, with Rhaenyra stating that with those knights they will end a war that would kill millions, and she will take her rightful place on the Iron Throne, with Jace asking what will happen when she dies and Rhaenyra saying that he is her heir, Jace, brought to tears, asks his mother if, when she slept with Harwin Strong, she did not think he might be like them, Rhaenyra tries to calm him down, but Jace shouts that he is not a fool and that the proof is there for all to see, but he can fight for his legitimacy because he has a dragon, accusing his mother of wanting to take that away from him too, Rhaenyra, also on the verge of tears, approaches Jacaerys and admits that she does not like this, with Jace telling her not to continue, but Rhaenyra says that she cannot dispute what the gods have placed before her, Jacaerys, hurt and angry, leaves go.

Mysaria meets Alyn and tells him to do whatever it takes for her to find the message, then Alyn leaves.

===In the Crownlands===
[[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] treats [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s superficial arm wound, received during the recent [[Riot in King's Landing|riot]]. Despondent after being removed from the [[Green Council|Small Council]], Alicent seeks solace in the [[Kingswood]], taking one [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]], Ser [[Rickard Thorne]], for protection and assistance. They make camp, and, when asked, Alicent says she may not return to King's Landing. She spends time riding her [[horse]] in the woods and floating in a lake, reflecting on her current status.

In the courtyard, [[Larys Strong|Larys]] observes as [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] sentences [[Martyn Reyne|two]] [[Eddard Waters|Kingsguards]] to lifetime servitude at the [[Wall]], ostensibly for fomenting the riots. Lord [[Jasper Wylde]] approaches Larys and says that Seasmoke has a new, unknown rider. Considering it an unverified rumor, Larys suggests they withhold telling Aemond. Against Orwyle's advice, Larys pushes him to accelerate [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s recovery, despite the physical exertion causing Aegon extreme pain.

Elinda receives Mysaria's instructions on where to find Targaryen bastards, and word quickly spreads throughout the city. In a tavern, [[Ulf]], who often boasted he has Targaryen ancestry, is urged to join the other dragonseeds heading to Dragonstone. Ulf is reluctant, claiming a leg injury, but he also harbors doubts regarding his real ancestry. [[Hugh]], grieving his daughter's recent death, tells his wife, [[Kat]], that [[Saera Targaryen|his prostitute mother]] was a Targaryen and that he desires to go to Dragonstone and claim a dragon, saying it will better their lives.

A few dozen dragonseeds board boats organized by Alyn and set sail for Dragonstone.

===The sowing of the seeds===
The Dragonseeds arrive by ship at Dragonstone, where Rhaenyra awaits them. As Rhaenyra descends to meet them, an older dragonkeeper declares in High Valyrian that this is an abomination. Rhaenyra, still in High Valyrian, asks what he is talking about. The dragonkeeper says that he has already sent an Andal before a dragon and that "the judgement was delivered", and that he now wants to send more. Rhaenyra says that Ser Steffon Darklyn was of Targaryen descent, but the dragon keeper says that was blasphemy, that Ser Steffon was not a dragonlord, and that neither are Dragonseeds. Rhaenyra then says that the gods sent them to them, but the dragonkeeper says that she did it. He then states that dragons are sacred as they are the last vestige of Old Valirya's magic left in the world and not playthings for men, he also states that their order will have no part in this and leaves, followed by all the dragonkeepers of Dragonstone. Rhaenyra is shocked but is not discouraged, so she approaches the Dragonseeds followed by Ser Lorent, [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] and Addam and speaks to them, she tells them that she thought she knew what it meant to claim a dragon, but now she means that what she knew is ashes in the wind. She says that perhaps it is due to blood, valor or something else, she notes that each of them has left a life behind to answer his call, a life they may not return to. She tells them that if they survive they will emerge transformed as no man or woman can face a dragon and not change, and that some may welcome the prospect of change, even death as the alternatives are privation, starvation and war and that the goal of the Blacks is to end the war for themselves, their families and all the realm. She says that if they add those two dragons to their numbers, the enemy will have to give way and peace will return, and with it the suffering will cease, and if the gods will it, no more blood will be shed. She then looks briefly at a dragon skull, then turns to the dragonseeds and informs them of the dragon they will have to tame, [[Vermithor]], the Bronze Fury, the dragon of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|The Conciliator]] that is the largest dragon in the world after Vhagar and perhaps the most fierce, then leads them towards it, telling them who hopes that the gods bless them.

Rhaenyra, followed by Ser Lorent, Addam, Baela, Maester Gerardys, some Dragonstone guards and the Dragonseeds go to the base under Dragonmount, when they are all on the stone bridge, Rhaenyra commands Vermithor to show himself, after a while, from the shadows appears the mighty Vermithor growling, Rhaenyra commands him to calm down, which Vermithor does, he approaches Rhaenyra and she puts a hand on his muzzle and both she and Vermithor close their eyes, for a moment they remain still, then Rhaenyra opens her eyes and turns to the Dragonseeds, asking who wants to be first and one of them, Silver Denys, makes his way through the suitors and approaches Vermithor and Rhaenyra, Rhaenyra declares that the dragon will "speak" and leaves followed by hers while the guards remain at the entrance, Vermithor peers at the dragonseeds growling and, when Denys brings his hand closer shaking hand to try to claim him, Vemithor throws a blast of flame that burns him alive along with other Dragonseeds, then proceeds to burn and eat most of them alive while Rhaenyra watches in shock. The Dragonseeds try to escape from Vermithor, Ulf, who had been knocked off his feet by Vermithor grabs a torch and runs into the tunnels beneath Dragonmount, the others meanwhile find themselves blocked by Dragonstone guards, so they climb down to get to the entrance, but being on the ground, they are closer to Vermithor, at which point they scatter and each run in their own direction, while Vermithor burns and eats them. Hugh, who managed to escape and hide behind a rock, meets another suitor and together they try to escape secretly, they are noticed by Vermithor and manage to elude his attack, Vermithor prepares to burn the girl, but Hugh attracts his attention and the girl manages to escape, Hugh then stands in front of Vermithor and tells him that he is ready and then shouts "Come on", Vermithor, surprisingly calms down, Hugh then approaches and puts his hand on him, understanding that he has been chosen as his rider, Hugh looks at him and smiles, the scene is seen by Rhaenyra who smiles at the idea of ​​having obtained the most powerful dragon available to her cause. 

Ulf, who had escaped into the caves, finds himself in a large hollow area under Dragonmount, there he accidentally steps on a clutch of eggs and, sensing a presence, turns and finds himself in front of Silverwing, the dragon of Queen Alysanne Targaryen and companion of Vermithor, she pushes him away with her snout, making him fall to the ground, Ulf tries to get up but a second push from Silverwing makes him tumble into a pool, Ulf pulls himself out of the pool and fears for his life, but Silverwing, after smelling him, retreats and gets into position to be ridden, Ulf, having understood that Silverwing has chosen him as her rider, starts laughing.

During a meeting of the Green Council, presided over by Aemond, Lord Jasper Wylde warns that [[Ormund Hightower|Lord Ormund Hightower]] is making slow progress and there is fear that his armies are caught between two forces of [[House Beesbury]], those present hear a buzz coming from outside the castle, but at first they give it little weight, Lord Jasper continues giving good news, [[Tessarion]], [[Daeron Targaryen|Prince Daeron]]'s dragon, has taken flight and will soon be ready to fight for the greens, and with him the Hightower army will be unstoppable, the members of the council hear the guards shout "dragon", and at that point Aemond, suspicious, opens the doors to the balcony and sees a dragon, Silverwing, flying in the sky, and moves to attack it. While the guards on the crossbows try to aim the dragon, Ulf makes the dragon go up and down in a pure state of ecstasy for his feat. Meanwhile, Aemond rides up to Vhagar and forces Ulf and Silverwing to flee. Aemond pursues them to Dragonstone, but when he sees Vermithor and Syrax, he orders Vhagar to retreat. On Dragonstone, Vermithor, Silverwing and Syrax roar in unison at the retreating Vhagar.

*Despite appearing and having speaking lines in this episode, and previously being part of the main cast, [[Paddy Considine]] remains entirely uncredited, similar to the previous episode.
*[[Eddy Beckett]], [[Aidan Brindle]], [[Katy Bullock]], [[Andrew Burford]], [[Michael Byrch]], [[Yusuf Chaudhri]], [[Nick Chopping]], [[David Cronnelly]], [[Matt Crook]], [[Tim Davies]], [[Will Dent]], [[Levan Doran]], [[Dom Dumaresq]], [[Josh Dyer]], [[Bradley Farmer]], [[Doren Farmer]], [[Pete Ford]], [[Martin Gordon]], [[Hannah Grant]], [[Richard Hall]], [[Lawrence Hansen]], [[Richard Hansen]], [[Jessica Hooker]], [[Rowley Irlam]], [[Robbie Keane]], [[Troy Kenchington]], [[Leigh Maddern]], [[Freddie Mason]], [[Leona McCarron]], [[Kim McGarrity]], [[Kat Pickering]], [[Tilly Powell]], [[Dominic Preece]], [[Daniel Rawlins]], [[Florian Robin]], [[Doug Robson]], [[Anthony Skrimshire]], [[Ailias Smith]], [[Sam Stefan]], [[Jonny Stockwell]], [[Ryan Stuart]], [[Laura Swift]], [[Calvin Warrington-Heasman]], [[Marlow Warrington-Mattei]], [[Josh Wheeldon]], [[Richard Wheeldon]], [[Leo Woodruff]], [[Ben Wright]], [[Lewis Young]], and [[Rob Hayns]] were stunt performers in this episode.

==Behind the scenes==
*This episode had a special advance screening at San Diego Comic-Con on July 26, 2024.{{Webref|name=CC |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://comiccon2024.sched.com/event/1gHJO/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-7-special-advance-screening |title=House of the Dragon Season 2 Episode 7: Special Advance Screening |website=Sched |access-date=July 13, 2024 }}
*This episode's ''[[House of the Dragon: The House That Dragons Built]]'' [[Episode 7 (House of the Dragon: The House That Dragons Built)|counterpart]] incorrectly lists its title as "Dragonseeds."{{Ref|THTDB207}}
*[[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]]'s control over [[Vhagar]] has significantly strengthened: in "[[The Black Queen]]", he could not stop Vhagar from attacking [[Arrax]], resulting in [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]]'s death; in the final scene of this episode, once Aemond suspects a trap, he manages to make Vhagar retreat.
*[[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] notices a rat in [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s room. Rats were seen in several of [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]]'s episodes ("[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]", "[[We Light the Way]]", "[[The Princess and the Queen]]"), perhaps a metaphor for how Targaryen rule is decaying.
*[[Oscar Tully]] seems politically inexperienced, but this turns to be a façade: he initially mentions the oath [[Grover Tully|his grandfather]] swore to [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]], stating he recognizes the authority of Rhaenyra and Daemon. Daemon smugly believes that Oscar will obediently rally the riverlords as Daemon demands; all of a sudden, Oscar cunningly turns the table on Daemon, by forcing him to execute Willem Blackwood for the [[Raids on Bracken lands|atrocities he performed against the Brackens]], making it very clear that otherwise the Riverlands will not support the Blacks. Daemon, being put in a corner, reluctantly does as Oscar demands.
**During the execution of Willem Blackwood, the background music is the same as in the previous episode, when Daemon was trapped in his dream, desperately trying to open the doors of the throne room and escape.
