{{Quote|Baela has Moondancer.|Daemon Targaryen|The Black Queen}}
'''Moondancer'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: Hūrlilio}} is one of the [[dragon]]s that belongs to [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]]. She is bonded to [[Baela Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Moondancer bonded with [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] from a young age.{{Ref|HOTD106}} She has pale green scales, dark tiger-like stripes, cream-colored eyes and horns, as well as pearlescent frills on her head and tail.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:OT2 Baela & Moondancer 3.png|thumb|Baela and Moondacer chase after Criston Cole.]]
Moondancer and [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] are patrolling the skies above the [[Crownlands]] when they see a retinue of mounted knights in a field consisting of Ser [[Criston Cole]] and Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]]. Baela commands Moondancer to pursue the knights, but are forced to withdraw the chase and return to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] when the knights take cover in a dense forest.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Moondancer flies around Dragonstone with [[Vermax]] as [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] and [[Mysaria]] discuss the impending war against the [[Greens]].{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
Moondancer is pale green, with pearl-white highlights on her horns and crest. While she was young and slender, she was conversely very fast and nimble - the one drawback of huge older dragons such as Vhagar or Caraxes is that they become so large that they are less maneuverable.
