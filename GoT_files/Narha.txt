'''Narha''' was a [[Slavery|bedslave]] in service to the [[Mataeryon family|Mataeryons]], one of the forty [[dragonlord]] families of [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]].

==Biography==
Narha was caught eating [[silk grass]], a plant forbidden for consumption by slaves. Her master [[Jaehaelor Mataeryon]] slit her wrists with his [[Valyrian steel]] blade for the crime. He then bottled her blood and used it to nourish his [[Ruby Fern]]s, which grew to extraordinary heights as a result.<ref>[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref>

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and their supplementary material, the only character named Narha is Narha Otherys, a [[Legitimization|legtimized]] [[bastard]] daughter of [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] and Bellegere Otherys.
