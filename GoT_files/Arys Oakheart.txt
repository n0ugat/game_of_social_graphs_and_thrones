==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Arys Oakheart is a member of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard, appointed after his predecessor - whose name has not been mentioned - perished during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. He is a member of House Oakheart, a noble house from the Reach.

He is regarded as one of the kinder knights of the Kingsguard under King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], objecting at first to the orders to beat [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], then only hitting her as lightly as he can. He is also of a much more pleasant demeanor, often engaging in pleasant conversation with the Stark girl.{{Bookref|ACOK|2}}

Arys remains in Dorne as Myrcella's sworn shield. During this time, Arianne Martell, Prince [[Doran Martell|Doran]]'s daughter and heiress, sexually seduces him. She persuades him to take part in her plan to crown Myrcella to incite war with the Iron Throne in retaliation for the death of [[Oberyn Martell]].{{Bookref|AFFC|13}} The plan is foiled, as Arianne's party is intercepted by [[Areo Hotah]]. Ser Arys, bravely but foolishly, charges at the surrounding soldiers and kills some of them, but is killed by Hotah. During the confrontation, Myrcella is gravely injured and nearly killed by one of their escorts, Ser Gerold "Darkstar" Dayne.{{Bookref|AFFC|21}}

Cersei is pleased to hear about Ser Arys's death since it creates a vacancy on the Kingsguard - which is filled by her new champion, Ser [[Gregor Clegane#In the books|Robert Strong]].{{Bookref|ADWD|54}}
