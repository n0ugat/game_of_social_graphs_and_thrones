'''House Mudd'''{{Ref|H&L313}} of [[Oldstones]] is an extinct great house that once ruled the [[Riverlands]] as [[King of the Rivers and Hills|Kings of the Rivers and Hills]]. Eventually, however, their line was seemingly extinguished after being defeated by the [[Storm King]]s of [[House Durrandon]]. Their seat was the castle of Oldstones, which now lies in ruins.

== In the books ==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Mudd was the last dynasty of [[First Men]] that ruled the [[Riverlands]]. Their seat was a castle now in ruins and called Oldstones. Under King Tristifer IV, "the Hammer of Justice", they resisted the [[coming of the Andals]]. Tristifer IV was said to have been victorious in ninety nine battles, but was defeated at his hundredth, in which seven Kings banded against him. Under his successor, King Tristifer V, House Mudd fell to the Andals and became extinct.

Tristan Mudd was a [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]], and is remembered as one of the worst Lord Commanders the Night's Watch has ever had. 

At present, in [[Essos]] there are still Westerosi exiles with the surname Mudd, Young John Mudd and Lorimas Mudd, members of the [[Golden Company]]; it is unknown if these are true descendants of House Mudd, because in the free companies a man can call himself whatever he chooses.
