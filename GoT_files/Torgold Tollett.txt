{{Quote|Six times the Andal knights charged and six times the First Men threw them back. But on the seventh, a fearsome Andal warrior broke through the ranks of the First Men and the Andals rushed through the gap.|[[Petyr Baelish]]|Knights of the Vale (short)}}
Ser '''Torgold Tollett'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was an [[Andals|Andal]] [[Knighthood|knight]] during the [[coming of the Andals]].

==Biography==
Known as a fearsome warrior, Torgold fought in the [[Battle of the Seven Stars]]. The [[First Men]] under King [[Robar II Royce]] had defended their position with sharpened stakes. The Andal cavalry charged six times, but were unable to break the line, until the seventh attempt, when Torgold broke through the First Men ranks, allowing the Andals to rush through the gap.{{Ref|H&L615}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Torgold Tollett was known as "Torgold the Grim", which was considered ironic as he was a larger-than-life personality who was known to ride into battle laughing and naked above the waist. He was a very large man who had a seven-pointed star carved across his chest and fought with an axe in each hand. Songs were written about him which claim that he knew no fear and felt no pain.

He fought under the leadership of Ser [[Artys Arryn|Artys I Arryn]] in the [[Battle of the Seven Stars]]. It has been claimed that although he was bleeding from a score of wounds he fought his way through Lord Redfort's strongest warriors and severed the lord's arm with a single cut. He was also said to have killed Ursula Upcliff by tearing her head off with his bare hands. He was killed by King [[Robar II Royce]], who slashed his head with [[Lady Forlorn]]. Tollett then laughed as he grabbed the blade, which sliced through his hands and buried itself in his skull. Songs claim that he died choking on his last laugh.
