'''Pentos'''{{Ref|GOT101}} is one of the [[Free Cities]], located on the western coastline of [[Essos]], across the [[Narrow Sea]] from [[Westeros]]. It is a large, rich city-state of merchant lords. People and things from Pentos are known as '''Pentoshi'''.

The city is the home of [[Magister]] [[Illyrio Mopatis]]. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]] temporarily reside in Pentos for about one year prior to Daenerys's marriage to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]].

==Geography==
Pentos is located at roughly the mid-latitude of the Free Cities, between [[Braavos]] in the north and [[Volantis]] in the south. It is due east of [[King's Landing]], directly across the [[Narrow Sea]]. It is surrounded by fertile coastal plains known as the [[Flatlands]].

==Economy==
Pentos' economy is based mostly on trade and commerce of products such as cheese. As a result, Pentoshi traders like Illyrio Mopatis are often referred to derogatorily as "cheese-mongers". They conduct brisk trade with the [[Seven Kingdoms]] across the Narrow Sea and use their wealth to pay tribute to the [[Dothraki]] to avoid being sacked by the nomadic people.

==Government==
[[File:Illyrio Mopatis.jpg|thumb|[[Illyrio Mopatis]], a Pentoshi merchant-lord.]]
Pentos is nominally ruled by a [[Prince of Pentos|Prince]] chosen by the city's Magisters from among the Pentoshi noble families. The Prince supposedly holds the powers of trade, justice, and war, and on every new year he must deflower the [[Maid of the Field]] and the [[Maid of the Seas]] to bring good fortune to the city. However, should a crop fail or a war be lost, the Magisters slit the Prince's throat and choose another. In truth, the Prince's power is only nominal, and the true rulers of the city are the council of Magisters, wealthy merchant-princes.<ref>"[[The Free Cities]]"</ref>

==History==
===Background===
Like the other Free Cities, Pentos originated as a colony of the [[Valyrian Freehold]], and after the [[Doom of Valyria]] it became an independent city-state during the ensuing [[Century of Blood]].

[[File:Pentos Official Guide.jpg|thumb|Pentoshi Manse]]
In the wake of the attacks conducted by the [[Craghas Drahar|Crabfeeder]]'s forces on ships passing near the [[Stepstones]], King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] explains to [[Corlys Velaryon]] that he has already sent envoys to both Pentos and Volantis to determine if they can find common cause against the Crabfeeder's attacks.<ref>"[[The Rogue Prince]]"</ref>

More than a decade after, [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Laena Velaryon]] along with their two children, travel to Pentos where they are hosted by Prince [[Reggio Haratis]]. There, Haratis offers to give them permanent residence in Pentos, even offering to gift them the manse they are currently staying in, as well as its farms, lands, vineyard, and wood, in exchange for an alliance against the [[Triarchy]].<ref>"[[The Princess and the Queen]]"</ref>

Daenerys and Viserys are guests of Illyrio in his manse just outside the city of Pentos. Drogo visits the manse to "view" Daenerys. They hold the wedding ceremony on the beach below the manse. Afterwards the Dothraki depart eastwards for the [[Dothraki Sea]], Daenerys and Viserys going with them.<ref>"[[Winter Is Coming]]"</ref> A few months later, Illyrio secretly travels from Pentos to King's Landing to consult with [[Varys]].<ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref>

[[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] tries to convince the pirate-lord [[Salladhor Saan]] to take a contract for his fleet of thirty ships to supplement the [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone|faction]] of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. Davos successfully wins over Salladhor by saying that he could spend the rest of his career making easy but small raids on the ships of "Pentoshi cheese-mongers" and "[[Meereen]]ese silk merchants", or he could help Stannis take King's Landing, which while more difficult will make Salladhor fabulously wealthy if they succeed.<ref>"[[The Night Lands]]"</ref>

While in [[Astapor]], [[Jorah Mormont]] and [[Barristan Selmy]] debate whether or not Daenerys should purchase an army of [[Unsullied]].

After a rough journey in a crate after escaping the capital, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrives in Pentos with Varys where they take rest for a short period. Varys informs Tyrion that he and the Magister of Pentos were secretly supporting the Targaryen cause. Varys convinces Tyrion to depart Pentos with him and head to Meereen to meet Daenerys Targaryen.<ref>"[[The Wars To Come]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Tyrion manages to convince [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] to flee with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] to Pentos to start a new life before the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. Previously he aranged for a small dingy to meet them at the shoreline of the Red Keep near the dragon skull cavern. However, when Jaime and Cersei try to get to the dingy to take them there, they find themselves trapped under the Red Keep and are killed when the cavern collapses in on them. 

==In the books==
[[File:Pentoshi servant.jpg|thumb|150px|Slavery is nominally illegal in Pentos, but the [[Pentoshi servant|Pentoshi "servant"]] at Illyrio's mansion shackled with a bronze collar is a slave in all but name.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Pentos was founded by [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] settlers as a trading outpost - though some sources claim Pentos existed before and its inhabitants decided to pay homage to the Freehold.

Pentos is a large seaport consisting of squat brick buildings and a number of large palaces and holdings, both within the walls and outside on the plains known as the [[Flatlands]]. Pentos's location makes it especially vulnerable to raids from the Dothraki. As such the Pentoshi merchants are prone to feasting and gifting the passing Dothraki warlords with lavish parties and gifts to appease them into not destroying their holdings.

[[Slavery]] is technically illegal in Pentos due to a treaty imposed by [[Braavos]] a hundred years before the events in the novels. However, the wealthy Magisters flout this law and keep bronze-collared "servants" that are slaves in all but name. Some Magisters are even involved in the slave trade.

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Pentos" is pronounced "PEN-tos", as opposed to "Pen-TOES", etc.
