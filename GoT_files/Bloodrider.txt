==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Drogo&bloodriders.jpg|thumb|Drogo and his bloodriders in [[Vaes Dothrak]]]]
[[Qotho]], [[Cohollo]], and [[Haggo]] serve as [[Drogo]]'s bloodriders.<ref>"[[Winter Is Coming]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] sends her three bloodriders, [[Rakharo]], [[Kovarro]], and [[Aggo (The North Remembers)|Aggo]] to ride away until they find a city or the sea.<ref>"[[The North Remembers]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Realizing that she needs to motivate her new (and enormous) ''khalasar'' into waiting until they have enough [[ships]] to take them to [[Westeros]], Daenerys [[Dragonrider|rides]] [[Drogon]] before them. She reminds them that she has yet to select her three bloodriders, as all ''khals'' have done before her. She then declares that she is not a ''khal'' and selects the entire ''khalasar'' her bloodriders.<ref>"[[Blood of My Blood]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the title of bloodrider carries great prestige within a ''khalasar''. Bloodriders sit next to the ''khal'' in feasts and ceremonies. They may also share the ''khal''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s wife (depending on the personal preferences of the khal in question), but never his horse. A bloodrider may also be a ''ko'', commanding a subdivision of the ''khalasar''.

If a ''khal'' is killed, bloodriders avenge him. Once done, their last service is to escort the ''[[khaleesi]]'' to [[Vaes Dothrak]] to join the [[Dosh Khaleen|dosh khaleen]]. Then they are to join the ''khal'' in death, in the [[Night Lands]].

Daenerys's bloodriders are Aggo, Jhogo, and Rakharo. So far in the books they are all alive and well.
