'''Nettles'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} is a [[bastard]]{{Ref|TDOD}} and a [[dragonseed]] who lived on [[Driftmark]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' and ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Nettles (also called Netty) is a bastard of uncertain birth who grew up homeless, motherless, and penniless in [[Spicetown]] and [[Hull]] on Driftmark, most likely making a living as a whore. 

Nettles is described as sixteen years old and very unattractive, black-haired, brown-eyed, brown-skinned, skinny, and foul-mouthed. Her teeth were crooked, and her nose scarred where it had once been slit for thieving. Although she is considered as a [[dragonseed]], she had no Valyrian features.

In the show, her character was merged with [[Rhaena Targaryen]].
