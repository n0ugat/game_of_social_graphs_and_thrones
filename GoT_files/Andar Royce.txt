==Behind the scenes==
Andar Royce is mentioned in the section on House Royce in the Season 1 prop for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. The section on House Royce never appears on-screen in the TV series, as its planned appearance, where [[Eddard Stark]] would have read from it, was cut.

==In the books==
Andar Royce is referenced only in the TV adaptation of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and has no corresponding counterpart in the books. The name of Yohn Royce's father has not been mentioned in the books. In the books, Yohn Royce's firstborn son and heir is named Andar Royce, but this character was never introduced in the show. This Andar participates in the [[Tournament#Tourney of the Hand|Tourney of the Hand]], where he is easily defeated by Jaime Lannister. He later resides in the Vale, serving House Arryn.
