[[File:House Tyrell banner.jpg|thumb|301x301px|The banner of House Tyrell of [[Highgarden]], the rulers of the [[Reach]].]]
'''House Tyrell'''{{Ref|GOT203}} of [[Highgarden]] is an extinct [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]]. It ruled over the [[Reach]], a vast, fertile, and heavily-populated region of southwestern Westeros as [[Lord Paramount of the Reach|Lords Paramount of the Reach]] and [[Warden of the South|Wardens of the South]] after taking control of the region from [[House Gardener]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]].

The House was formerly led by Lord [[Mace Tyrell]]. Mace's son [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] was a noted [[tournament]] [[Knighthood|knight]] and, secretly, the lover of Lord [[Renly Baratheon]]. Mace's daughter [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] married Renly when he crowned himself king in the [[War of the Five Kings]] to cement an alliance between Renly and her father. Following Renly's [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|death]], Margaery was then married to King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] before his assassination at his [[Purple Wedding|wedding feast]]. She was then married to his younger brother, King [[Tommen Baratheon]]. Mace's mother, the indomitable [[Olenna Tyrell]], assumed House Tyrell's lordship after Margaery, Loras, and Mace Tyrell were all killed by [[wildfire]] at the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|destruction]] of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Under Olenna, House Tyrell realigned itself with [[House Targaryen]] and declared for [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in opposition against [[Cersei Lannister]], who had orchestrated the downfall of House Tyrell. With the death of Olenna after the [[Sack of Highgarden]], the House has officially become extinct. In the TV series, the Tyrell family is very small, has only four known members of the main branch.

The Tyrell [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a golden rose on a pale green field. Their [[house words]] are "Growing Strong."<ref>"[[House Tyrell (short)|House Tyrell]]"</ref><ref name="E24">"[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"</ref>

==History==
===Background===
House Tyrell was founded by [[Alester Tyrell]], an [[Andals|Andal]] [[Knighthood|knight]], during the [[coming of the Andals]]. Ser Alester and his family became senior servants of [[House Gardener]], the [[King of the Reach|Kings of the Reach]], serving for millennia as stewards of the royal castle at [[Highgarden]]. Over time they rose to prominence as one of the strongest noble Houses in the Reach, and even intermarried with the royal line - though so did many other powerful Houses from the Reach.

During [[Aegon's Conquest]], King [[Mern IX Gardener]] was burned alive at the [[Field of Fire]] by the Targaryen [[dragon]]s, along with all of his immediate heirs. Subsequently, Mern's steward [[Harlen Tyrell]] voluntarily surrendered Highgarden to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]]. Aegon rewarded Harlen by making him Lord of Highgarden and [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]] - ahead of other Houses from the Reach which were actually more closely related to House Gardener.<ref name="House Tyrell viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/tyrell/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Tyrell entry]</ref> Chief among these is [[House Florent]] of Brightwater Keep, which claims direct male-line descent from the old Gardener kings, while House Tyrell only claim descent from House Gardener through the female line.[[File:Harlen_Tyrell_surrender_to_Aegon_the_Conqueror.png|thumb|Harlen Tyrell surrenders to Aegon the Conqueror.]]

House Tyrell's overall disposition is adequately represented by their sigil of a rose: a rose's beauty often hides the fact that it has thorns. Though the Tyrells do try to be just and fair, their benevolent demeanor serves to lull their enemies into thinking that, like the Starks, they are utterly beholden to honorable conduct. In reality, the Tyrells are just as cunning as the Lannisters in court politics and intrigue, though they often prefer a more subtle approach. Thus they strike a pragmatic balance between the Starks' honor and the Lannisters' ruthlessness.

Throughout history, House Tyrell has played by the strategy of following the sure path, siding with whoever is most likely to win in any conflict. During [[Aegon's Conquest]], they surrendered Highgarden to the invading forces of Aegon the Conqueror, and in return the Tyrells were elevated as the new Lords Paramount of the Reach. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], House Tyrell remained loyal to [[House Targaryen]], as [[Robert Baratheon]] was a rebel unlikely to win, and the Tyrells owed their rule of the Reach to the Targaryens. Forces of House Tyrell managed to inflict the only loss Robert suffered during the war, albeit an indecisive one, at the [[Battle of Ashford]]. However, the vast army and resources of House Tyrell were tied up on a siege of [[Storm's End]] (held for Robert by his brother; [[Stannis Baratheon]]). After the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]'s death, the Tyrells surrendered and swore fealty to Robert Baratheon. [[File:Tyrell_surrender_to_Robert.png|thumb|Mace Tyrell surrenders to Robert Baratheon.]]

In the current generation, House Tyrell is a stable and honestly loving family, with none of the internal rivalries that are to be found in [[House Lannister]] and [[House Baratheon]]. Thus the relationships between Lord Mace and his children, and between siblings like Loras and [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]], are genuine and uncomplicated.

==Current status==
*Though it was initially unclear who the heirs to House Tyrell actually were in the TV continuity at this point, it seems that the TV series is drastically condensing it so that the Tyrells would now be extinct after [[Olenna Tyrell]]'s death (and Olenna wasn't born a Tyrell, she married into the family). In the Season 6 finale, Olenna only vaguely mentions that with the deaths of her son Mace and her grandchildren Margaery and Loras, Cersei took away her "future". In the novels, they actually have two older brothers, Willas and Garlan, who were omitted from the TV continuity, as Loras was repeatedly said to be ''the'' current heir to his father. Moreover, as a large and powerful Great House, in the books they have numerous cousins and second cousins who hold various positions within their reign over the Reach.
**In the books, Olenna and old Lord [[Luthor Tyrell]] had three children: their son Mace and two daughters, Janna and Mina. Janna married a Fossoway with no known children, while Mina actually married her own first cousin Paxter Redwyne (Olenna's nephew), producing two sons and a daughter.
**Meanwhile, even if Olenna's entire bloodline is dead in the TV version, Luthor in the novels had younger brothers who themselves had descendants: Maester Gorman (who cannot inherit), Garth the Gross (Seneschal of Highgarden), and Moryn (Lord Commander of the City Watch of Oldtown). Garth has two bastard sons, while Moryn had two legitimate sons, three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren. It's doubtful that ''all'' of them will gather in the Great Sept for Margaery's trial in the next novel and end up being killed in Cersei's wildfire explosion.
*[[File:Tyrell Lady new.jpg|thumb|254x254px|One could assume that Olenna can't literally be the last Tyrell: [[Tyrell lady|other Tyrell cousins]] exist in the books and were even introduced in the TV series.]] The TV continuity technically did acknowledge that other minor Tyrell cousins exist, ''and'' they are direct descendants of Olenna. Back in Season 3 episode 4 "[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]", an unnamed Tyrell handmaiden - credited only as "[[Tyrell lady]]" - actually had a speaking line in which she showed her embroidery to Olenna and asked, "Do you like it, Nana?" - i.e. directly stating that Olenna is her ''grandmother''. In the books many of the minor Tyrell cousins serve as handmaidens to the main members of the family, thus it was always somewhat implied that the background handmaidens that appear in the TV show are actually Tyrell cousins. This "Tyrell lady" was never formally named, but the eldest of Margaery's cousins who serve in her company as handmaidens is Elinor Tyrell (though Elinor isn't a granddaughter but descended from Moryn - Olenna's other granddaughter through Mace's sister is Desmera Redwyne).
**Of course, given that Mace Tyrell was in the Great Sept with his entire retinue along with Margaery to observe Loras's trial, it is not impossible that ''all'' of Margaery's handmaidens, including her cousins, were present in the Great Sept and killed in the explosion, and by the [[Eastwatch|fifth episode]] of [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|Season 7]], it is made clear that this is apparently the case.<ref name="Eastwatch" />

== Military strength ==
The strength of House Tyrell has remained mostly unscathed during the [[War of the Five Kings]], around 15,800 men, according to Olenna.<ref>"[[Kissed by Fire]]"</ref> Later, a small part of these forces is annihilated by the Lannister-Tarly forces at the [[Sack of Highgarden]], leading to Olenna's death, thus eliminating the once formidable great house.

As the second richest house, Tyrell soldiers seem to be well-equipped, yet still far behind to the Lannisters. This is particularly evidenced by the high quality swords and weapons purchased due to the Reach's fertile lands.

Despite the Tyrell army being diverse and ornamentally impressive in design, their vassals seem to follow this motif (bright colored armor and steel plates) despite their preference to be considered as independent houses. Most notably, [[House Tarly]] which used red tunics and steel armor which distinguishes them from House Tyrell.

It is relatively quite unknown how the Tyrell army is experienced in terms of warfare since most of their army didn't partake in pitch battles during the War of the Five Kings. Numerous battles such as the Battle of the Blackwater showed it’s capability in combat, wherein the combined cavalry of both House Lannister and Tyrell easily managed to crush [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s army with ease. Although it can be considered that they fought using mounted soldiers which gives an advantage compared to the foot soldiers used during the battle. Later in [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|Season 7]], it is revealed that the Tyrell army is incapable of fighting as stated by Olenna Tyrell by grimly stating "It was never our forte". This can be an assumption that House Tyrell is more reliant and dependent on their more martial vassals like the Tarlys and other houses to fight their battles.

The Reach is controlled mostly by House Tyrell, mostly due to Harlan Tyrell’s surrender of Highgarden to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] thus elevating their status. Despite their status, however, their vassals seem to act self-beneficially and have questionable loyalties such as the [[House Florent|Florents]] and the [[House Fossoway|Fossoways]], who aligned themselves with Stannis rather than follow their liege lords. House Tarly, on the other hand, chose to reluctantly ally with the Lannisters in fear of the [[Dothraki]].

==Behind the scenes==
*According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Tyrell" is pronounced "TI-rul", as opposed to "Tie-rell", etc. In spite of this, several characters, including Lady Olenna, have inconsistently alternated with pronouncing it "TIE-rell".<ref name="E32">"[[The Lion and the Rose]]"</ref> Even ''within the same scene'' in Season 3's "[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]," Cersei says "Tie-rell" while Tywin says "Tih-rul" (although since this different works to underscore their disagreement, it may be intentional for that one scene). When asked about this, official ''Game of Thrones'' linguist [[David J. Peterson]] (creator of the [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]] and [[High Valyrian|Valyrian languages]], who did not create the pronunciation guide) said that he personally pronounces it as "Tie-rell", but has heard it both ways on the TV show - given that he doesn't himself decide how to pronounce basic character names. He did offer that maybe, just as in real life, there are simply multiple ways to pronounce the same name.<ref>[http://www.dothraki.com/2013/07/vaes-dothrak-vimithreri/ David J. Peterson's blog]</ref>
*The HBO Viewer's Guide for Season 1 lists Mace Tyrell and Alerie Hightower as having four children – [[Willas Tyrell|Willas]], Garlan, Loras and Margaery – in keeping with the books. Willas and Garlan were not mentioned at all on-screen, were removed from the Viewer's Guide for Season 2, and did not reappear in the Viewer's Guide for Season 3. Loras was explicitly confirmed as being the heir to Highgarden in "[[The Climb]]". Willas and Garlan's roles in the narrative (the Tyrell who was to wed Sansa Stark and the Tyrell who asked for Margaery to marry Joffrey) had already been given to Loras on-screen.
**In an interview during Season 3, writer [[Bryan Cogman]] admitted that the status of the older two Tyrell brothers was always in a limbo state, as they couldn't fit them into the narrative but at the same time were reluctant to outright confirm that they would never appear at all. Similarly, the writers never thought that they would introduce [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s daughter [[Shireen Baratheon]] when they introduced him in Season 2, but were careful to leave the door open to introduce her later, which they ultimately did in Season 3 (making sure to say that "Stannis has no sons" so they could later say he does have a daughter, without contradicting themselves). Thus it only really became utterly clear that the other Tyrells from the books wouldn't be introduced by Seasons 5 to 6. As Cogman said in Season 3:
:::''"At this point, in show canon, Loras and Margaery are the only children of Mace Tyrell. Margaery is eldest, Loras is the heir. Considering this plotline dominates the season, it was felt we needed the Tyrell engaged to Sansa (and then Cersei) had to be the Tyrell the audience is familiar with, as opposed to an unseen character."''<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Season_3_Interview_Bryan_Cogman Westeros.org,] Season 3 Interview: Bryan Cogman.</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tyrell is a powerful noble house. The Reach is the most populous region of the Seven Kingdoms, and the Tyrells can field the largest army on the continent, although the Lannisters, being richer, can better equip their troops. This makes the Tyrells formidable enemies but excellent allies.

House Tyrell never ruled as "kings and queens", as opposed to the Starks, [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], or [[House Arryn|Arryns]]. Before King Aegon I Targaryen's invasion and unification of the Seven Kingdoms, the Tyrells were stewards to [[House Gardener]], the Kings of the Reach. The Tyrells had responsibility for maintaining the castle of [[Highgarden]], the seat of royal power in the Reach. In the battle known as the [[Field of Fire]], King Mern IX Gardener and all of his issue were burned alive by Aegon's [[dragon]]s. Harlen Tyrell, King Mern's steward, surrendered Hightower to King Aegon and was rewarded with the title of Lord Paramount of the Reach and Warden of the South.

[[House Florent]] of [[Brightwater Keep]] has long disputed the suitability of the Tyrells to the rule of the Reach because they can claim a closer blood-relationship to the old kings of House Gardener. House Florent is a cadet branch of House Gardener, founded by a younger son of the main Gardener line, while House Tyrell can only claim descent from House Gardener through the female line.

As a result, the Florents have often bucked the authority of the Tyrells in the past three centuries since the Targaryen conquest. It came as little surprise when after Renly died and House Tyrell led their vassals in switching to support King Joffrey and the Lannisters, House Florent was the only major House from the Reach to switch allegiance to Stannis instead. Indeed, Stannis's wife, Selyse, is herself a Florent.

Thus the Tyrells, while always maintaining firm control of the Reach, have always feared they have an uneasy grip on their rule. While the Tyrells possess very fertile lands from which they can raise large armies, there are other powerful noble families in the Reach, such as House Florent, which don't particularly respect them the way the vassals of the Starks and Lannisters respect them because they used to be their kings. A great deal of skill at court politics has thus been needed to keep the Tyrells' powerful vassals in check, though Tyrells like Lady [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna]] possess this in abundance. Therefore, House Tyrell is always on the lookout to secure a marriage into a royal line, strengthen their prestige and cement their rule over the Reach.

The Martells and Tyrells have been sworn enemies for many generations. Over the centuries, they have fought border wars beyond count and raided back and forth across mountains and marches even when at peace. The enmity between the two houses waned a bit after Dorne became part of the Seven Kingdoms, but the maiming of Willas Tyrell by the Dornish prince [[Oberyn Martell]] in a joust fanned the animosity between the families, though Willas himself does not hold any grudge against Oberyn, as both men knew what happened was simply an unfortunate accident.

As [[D.B. Weiss]] summed it up in a Season 2 featurette, in the current generation House Tyrell is a closet matriarchy of sorts. While dependable, honorable, and loyal, the men of House Tyrell aren't particularly intelligent or adept at politics. Instead, the female members of House Tyrell (such as Margaery and her father's mother, Olenna) are the intelligent ones who actively plan out the political course that House Tyrell will take. An exception to this is Lord Mace's eldest son, Willas, who, unlike his father and two younger brothers ([[Garlan Tyrell|Garlan]] and Loras), is said to be quite well-educated.

Since being elevated to rule of the Reach, during any major Westeros-wide conflict, the Tyrells have frequently judged a conflict and then followed the strategy of pragmatically siding with whoever seems most likely to win, rather than fighting for abstract principles of law or honor. During the Targaryen Conquest, they surrendered to the Targaryens willingly in return for their favor. In Robert's Rebellion, they sided with the Mad King because they owed the Targaryens everything, and didn't think Robert Baratheon could defeat him. During the civil war known as the Dance of the Dragons, however, the Tyrells judged that the faction of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and the faction of [[Aegon II Targaryen]] were so evenly matched that it was not obvious at the outset which side would win. With neither side having a clear advantage over the other, to the surprise of both, the Tyrells declared neutrality and took no part in the war (though their bannermen were heavily divided between the two sides).

In the books, as in the series, the Lannisters grow increasingly concerned with how much power the Tyrells managed to gain. Ever since the second novel, the Tyrells become the Lannisters' most important allies, and they take full advantage of that to increase their (and their bannermen) political power, slowly but surely.

Following the battle of the Blackwater, the Tyrells are greatly rewarded for reinforcing the Lannister troops: Margaery is betrothed to Joffrey; Loras becomes a member of the Kingsguard; Mace is given a seat at the Small Council as [[Master of Ships]]; Garlan is granted the lands of House Florent. Two of the Tyrells' bannermen, Paxter Rewyne, and Mathis Rowan, are also granted seats in the Small Council.

During the third book, [[Tywin Lannister]] decides to restore [[Pycelle]] (whom [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] had previously sent to the black cells beneath the [[Red Keep]]) to the position of Grand Maester after he received word that the [[Citadel]] planned on naming Maester Gormon, born Gormon Tyrell, his replacement.

Following Tywin's death, the Tyrells grow bolder with their demands, among them to wed Margaery to Tommen shortly after his brother's death, much to Cersei's annoyance. Cersei's resentment toward the Tyrells soon turns into mistrust, and then to paranoia, based on several items:
*Shortly after Tyrion's escape, Qyburn informs Cersei that an ancient Tyrell coin was found in the cell of a jailer named Rugen (who is Varys in disguise).
*Lady Taena Merryweather of Myr, wife of the newly-appointed master of laws, tells Cersei that her handmaiden Senelle is spying for Margaery and that Olenna pays merchants in King's Landing with old coins which are only half the weight of newly minted gold dragons.{{Note|Taena's true motives and allegiance are unclear. There are various fan speculations about her, among them that she is Doran Martell's agent - the one who warned him about Cersei's scheme to assassinate Trystane.}}
At first, Cersei suspects that someone is seeking to drive a wedge between the Lannisters and Tyrells; this may be the truth (in view of Varys's statement at the end of the fifth novel), but Cersei's paranoia soon overcomes her logic.

As Margaery's popularity and influence over Tommen grow, Cersei suddenly realizes (correctly) that the Tyrells had a motive to dispose of Joffrey. She becomes convinced that the Tyrells plot to undermine the Lannisters; they conspired with Tyrion to murder Joffrey, maybe to murder Tywin too; they helped Tyrion escape from jail; lastly, Margaery is the queen whom [[Maggy]] referred to. Driven by her paranoia, Cersei plots to have Margaery charged with adultery and shamed in public. However, similarly to each and every scheme Cersei comes up with, this one goes wrong too: the witnesses against Margaery prove to be false, and Cersei finds herself in a much worse position than Margaery. Ironically, as a result of the scheme, the Tyrells grow more in power.

Kevan, like his niece, is wary of the Tyrells' power greed; however, he acknowledges that alienating the Tyrells is a much worse option than complying with their demands. He chides Cersei for rejecting Mace's request to become the King's Hand, reasoning that although Mace is hardly suitable for that office - it is even more foolish to make him a foe.

By the end of the fifth novel, [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] becomes concerned because the Tyrells increase their power gradually at the expense of the Lannisters: they have three of the seats in the Small Council (Mace - the King's Hand, [[Randyll Tarly]] - Master of laws and justiciar, Lord [[Paxter Redwyne]] - Master of ships and grand admiral); a hundred of Highgarden men have been added to the gold cloaks; Lord Tyrell and Tarly have both brought armies to King's Landing, while most of the Lannister troops are away in the Riverlands. Kevan's hands are tied, however, because Cersei's attempts to limit the Tyrells' power were utterly ludicrous and could only be resolved by giving the Tyrells their current concessions.

The rest of the Tyrells are:
*Lady Mina Tyrell, Lord Mace's sister. Married to Lord [[Paxter Redwyne]].
