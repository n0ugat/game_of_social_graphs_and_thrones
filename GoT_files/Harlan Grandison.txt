He took part in a [[tournament|tourney]] at [[Bitterbridge]] as a [[mystery knight]], but was defeated and unmasked by [[Gwayne Gaunt]].{{Ref|GOT806}}{{Note|The paragraph mentioning this event is erroneously placed in Arthur Dayne's entry. The opening sentence calling him the "thirdborn son to Lord Symon of House Gaunt" makes it apparent that this paragraph was meant for Gwayne Gaunt's entry.|name=Gwayne Gaunt}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Harlan is mentioned under the entry of Ser [[Arthur Dayne]],{{Note|name=Gwayne Gaunt}} in the ''[[Book of Brothers]]'', which the new [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth]] was flicking through.{{Ref|GOT806}}
