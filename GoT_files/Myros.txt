{{Quote|The next Grand Maester dared object to Maegor taking a third wife when taking his second wife had ruined his brother's reign because Maegor's first wife was the niece of the High Septon.

'''Myros'''{{Con|F&B}} was [[Grand Maester]] during the reign of [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]]. He was the second of three Grand Maesters [[Execution|executed]] by Maegor.

==Biography==
Myros was beheaded by King Maegor for [[treason]], having objected to the king's decision to [[Marriage|marry]] [[Tyanna of the Tower]] after the chaos marrying [[Alys Harroway]] caused.{{Ref|H&L806}}

==In the books==
In ''Fire & Blood'', Myros spoke against King Maegor's marriage to Tyanna of the Tower, calling [[Ceryse Hightower]] his true wife. Maegor silently listened, then killed the maester where he stood with [[Blackfyre]].

In ''A Storm of Swords'', [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] mentions that Maegor the Cruel's headsman unmade three Grand Maesters with his axe (without mentioning their names). This is the only reference in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels to Myros, alongside [[Gawen]] and [[Desmond]].
