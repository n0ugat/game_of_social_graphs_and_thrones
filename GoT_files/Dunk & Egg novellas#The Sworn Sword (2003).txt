==Adaptation==
{{Main|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms}}
On February 10, 2013, George R.R. Martin confirmed that he had been in discussion with [[HBO]] over a possible adaptation of the Dunk & Egg novellas, though in what format (TV movies, theatrical movie, or a spin-off TV series) was not made clear.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/ASoWS/News/Entry/Tuf_Voyaging_Reissued_TV_Project_Discussed Westeros.org]</ref>

On January 21, 2021, ''Variety'' first reported rumors that a new attempt was being made to pitch a ''Dunk & Egg'' prequel series.<ref>[https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/game-of-thrones-tales-of-dunk-and-egg-series-hbo-1234889520/ ''Variety'',] January 21, 2021</ref> Months later on November 30, 2021, {{WPS|Deadline Hollywood|Deadline}} reported that an adaptation was in development, and that the pitch was advanced enough that screenwriter [[Steve Conrad]] was attached as showrunner.<ref>[https://deadline.com/2021/11/dunk-egg-steve-conrad-writer-game-of-thrones-prequel-series-hbo-1234881825/ ‘Dunk & Egg’: Steve Conrad To Write ‘Game Of Thrones’ Prequel HBO Series – Deadline]</ref>

On March 9, 2022, George R.R. Martin himself gave an update in his blog about potential prequel projects, confirming that Steve Conrad was attached to a potential ''Dunk & Egg'' series, and that it has passed from the "pitch" phase to the "pilot script" phase, though it's unknown if HBO will ultimately greenlight filming on a pilot episode. Martin said that they haven't decided on a working title for the series yet, as he's been calling it ''A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms'' but there are also arguments to call it ''The Hedge Knight''. As Martin said:

:''The third of the live action shows is the Dunk & Egg series, helmed by Steve Conrad. My team and I have had some great sessions with Steve and his team, and we really hit it off. He's determined to do a faithful adaptation of the stories, which is exactly what I want; these characters and stories are very precious to me. The first season will be an adaptation of the first novella, 'The Hedge Knight.'   Contrary to what you may have read online, the show will not be called DUNK & EGG, which could be mistaken for a sitcom by viewers unfamiliar with the stories. We're leaning toward A KNIGHT OF THE SEVEN KINGDOMS for the series title, though THE HEDGE KNIGHT has its partisans as well."<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/09/random-updates-and-bits-o-news/ Random Updates and Bits o’ News,] GRRM, Not A Blog, March 9, 2022</ref>
