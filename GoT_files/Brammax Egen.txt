==Biography==
Brammax Egen was a member of [[House Egen]], a noble house in the [[Vale of Arryn]]. In 225 AC he murdered [[Junia Royce]], then aged seventeen, in her own bed, out of jealousy.<ref name="s1prop">''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' prop from Season 1</ref>

Brammax Egen is mentioned in the section on House Royce in the Season 1 prop for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. The section on House Royce never appears on-screen in the TV series, as its planned appearance, where [[Eddard Stark]] would have read from it, was cut.

==In the books==
Brammax Egen is referenced only in the TV adaptation of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and has no corresponding counterpart in the books.
