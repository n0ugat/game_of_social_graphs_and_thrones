The '''Green Fork'''{{Ref|H&L114}} is one of the three main rivers of the [[Trident]]. It starts in the bogs of the [[Neck]], technically within the southern borders of the [[North]]. The river flows south, crossing the border into the [[Riverlands]], and then past the two towers of the castle known as the [[Twins]], the seat of [[House Frey]]. It flows southeast for several hundred more miles before reaching the main body of the Trident. Just before that confluence is the [[Ruby Ford]], where the [[Battle of the Trident]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]] was fought and where [[Robert Baratheon]] slew [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] in combat. The ford is named for the rubies that ornamented Rhaegar's breast plate that were said to have been scattered in the river when he was killed by Robert's war hammer.
