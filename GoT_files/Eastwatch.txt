== Synopsis ==
=== In the Reach ===
[[File:Bronn_saves_jaime_Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|Bronn pulls Jaime from the water.]]
In the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], Ser [[Bronn]] pulls [[Jaime Lannister]] from the depths of [[Blackwater Rush]], and onto the shore, after Jaime's failed attempt to slay [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and end the war. Bronn tells Jaime the only reason he rescued him is that nobody gets to kill Jaime until Bronn gets the reward he's due from the Lannisters. Jaime, shellshocked, remarks on the destructive power Drogon alone unleashed, and realizes they are in great peril if Daenerys deploys all three in future battles. Bronn assures that he won't be around for such an assault, as Jaime laments his duty to report what happened to [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Bronn thinks it would be safer for him to jump back into the river than deal with Cersei's wrath.
[[File:Dany and Tyrion Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion and Dany pitch to the lords of the Reach.]]
Meanwhile on the [[Goldroad]], [[Tyrion Lannister]] grimly assesses the carnage of the battle, seeing the ashes of wagons, horses and Lannister soldiers. The prisoners of war are being herded by the [[Dothraki]] to Daenerys, with [[Drogon]] (apparently none the worse from taking a [[scorpion]] bolt to the shoulder) perched behind her menacingly and majestically. Daenerys appeals to them, bringing up the rumors spread about her by Queen Cersei, and warnings of brutality that the Dragon Queen would bring - burning down homes, and murdering families. She assures she is not here to murder, but to destroy the wheel of power that rolls over the rich and poor alike, to no one's benefit but people like Cersei Lannister. She offers them a choice - bend the knee and join her in her quest to make the world a better place than ever before, or refuse and die. Tyrion looks at her apprehensively upon hearing this. Only a few kneel at first; Drogon, apparently insulted by their refusal to accept his mother's command, bellows at them and most quickly yield. However, [[Randyll Tarly]], his son [[Dickon Tarly|Dickon]], and a handful of men refuse. Daenerys summons Randyll forward, where he insists he already has a [[King|Queen]]. Tyrion recalls he didn't pledge to Cersei until recently, and that she [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|murdered]] the [[Margaery Tyrell|rightful]] Queen, destroying [[House Tyrell]] for good. He observes Randyll's allegiances are "flexible" to which Randyll answers there are no easy choices in war. He tells Tyrion that Cersei is at least a true Westerosi, and that Tyrion is a kinslayer, having killed his [[Tywin Lannister|father]], as well as supporting a foreigner, bringing savages to their continent. Daenerys accepts Randyll's answer, and prepares to carry out a sentence, but Tyrion intervenes with the possibility of sending Randyll, a skilled warrior, to the [[Wall]] instead of death. Randyll replies Daenerys cannot send him to the Wall as she is not his Queen.
[[File:Dickon Randyall Tarly Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Dickon and Randyll prepare to be executed.]]
Daenerys signals for three Dothraki men to apprehend him, but Dickon suddenly speaks up insisting he will have to be killed too. Randyll, horrified, tries to silence his son. Tyrion reminds Dickon that he is the future of House Tarly and insists that he submit, reminding him what happened to House Tyrell. Randyll silently nods in agreement to Dickon, indicating his tactic approval to his heir to bend the knee so Dickon may be spared. Dickon refuses to relent on his decision. Tyrion proposes to Daenerys about having them committed to the cells for a time instead, but Daenerys, being ruthless but pragmatic, does not wish to grant the reputation of putting traitors in chains, or many would take advantage. She resumes her sentencing for them both, as they hold hands. Drogon unleashes his dragonfire, burning Randyll and Dickon alive and reducing them both to flame and ash in seconds, killing them instantly. Terrified, the remaining soldiers instantly kneel as Tyrion reflects uneasily over the execution.

=== At Winterfell ===
At the [[Godswood]] in [[Winterfell]], [[Bran Stark]] wargs into a flock of [[raven]]s to fly over the Wall into the [[Land of Always Winter]]. Through the ravens, he sees the [[Wight|army of the dead]] led by the [[White Walkers]] and the [[Night King]], traveling south towards [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. His reconnaissance continues until the Night King sees the ravens, at which Bran severs the connection. He tells [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Wolkan]] that they need to send ravens at once.

Later, in Winterfell's council chamber, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] observes [[Sansa Stark|her sister]] presiding over a meeting of the Northern lords. Saying that the King in the North should stay in the north, Lord [[Robett Glover]] and Lord [[Yohn Royce]] of the [[Vale of Arryn]] imply they made a mistake in their choice of ruler and that she take over power in the absence of her half-brother Jon Snow. However, Sansa insists Jon Snow is their true ruler who is doing what he believes is right for their people and that she is his regent. Following the meeting, Sansa confides her frustration in the Northern lords with Arya, who calls Sansa out for diplomatically handling their concerns instead of shutting the lords down. Arya thinks that she should not let the lords get away with insulting Jon and hints at assassinating them. Sansa disagrees, at which Arya calls attention to the fact that Sansa is using their parents' chambers and that she still thinks she's better than anyone else – perhaps she even thinks that she will need the support of the northern lords if she wishes to seize the North for herself, even if she tries not to think of it. Disturbed at her younger sister's homicidal streak and hurt by the accusations, Sansa tells Arya that she has "work to do."

Much later, Arya stalks [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] as he is walking through the grounds of Winterfell. Arya sees him speaking with [[Winterfell spy|a servant]] (she is too far to hear their conversation), then follows him to his personal quarters and sees him chatting at the door with Maester Wolkan. She eavesdrops on Petyr asking Wolkan if he is sure that "this" is the only copy. Assured that it is, Petyr replies that "Lady Stark thanks him for his services." Petyr then briefly enters his room, and leaves once again. Arya enters Petyr's chamber and rummages through his study and furniture. Hidden under his mattress, she finds a scroll. This turns out to be the scroll that Sansa wrote long ago to [[Robb Stark|Robb]], urging him to yield to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]. Arya, unaware that Sansa had written the letter under duress from Cersei in an attempt to save [[Eddard Stark|their father]], looks horrified. She rolls up the scroll and sneaks out of the room, oblivious to a grinning Littlefinger watching from behind a wall.

=== In Oldtown ===
At the [[Citadel]], a conclave of [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] read Bran Stark's message warning of the army of the dead but are dismissive of his account. [[Samwell Tarly]], present only to swap out some books, vouches for Bran and tells the Maesters that Bran spent several years surviving in the wilds alone. One Maester mockingly tells Samwell to practice with inscribing instead of entertaining myths and fables. Sam counters that they should use their position as Maesters to warn the people to prepare for the coming Night. [[Archmaester]] [[Ebrose]] opines that Bran's message could be genuine, but could be disinformation spread by Queen Daenerys. The Maesters agree to send a letter to Winterfell to investigate Bran's claims further, but as they regard the White Walkers as legendary beings akin to the [[Children of the Forest]] and the [[Drowned God]], they clearly want to believe Ebrose's misinformation theory. While they agree to investigate Bran's message in further detail, they are skeptical of his claims. After Sam leaves, one of the other Archmaesters asks if it's true that Sam's father and brother were recently burned alive. Ebrose confirms this, and admits that he hasn't had the heart to tell Sam yet.

Later that night, [[Gilly]] reads [[High Septon]] [[High Septon (Robert's Rebellion)|Maynard]]'s diary. Gilly tells Samwell the High Septon issued an [[Elia Martell|annulment]] for "[[Rhaegar Targaryen|Prince Ragger]]" so that he could marry another woman in [[Dorne]]. This new marriage indicates that any children Rhaegar may have with this new wife (presumably [[Lyanna Stark]]) are his trueborn children and not bastards. The enormity of the discovery is lost on both of them, with Gilly ignorant of [[Robert's Rebellion]] and Samwell being preoccupied with his own misery.
[[File:Sam and Gilly Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Samwell voices his frustration to Gilly.]]
Samwell complains about having to inscribe the bodily functions of High Septon Maynard. In exasperation with his situation, Samwell stalks out of the room and goes to the library. He grabs several books and other items. After a contemplative look at the atrium of the room, he meets Gilly in the courtyard of the Citadel where she and Sam wait for him in a wagon. When Gilly asks if he is sure whether he wants to give up his studies, Samwell replies that he is "tired of reading about the achievements of better men", quoting his father. They ride off into the night.

=== On Dragonstone ===
[[File:HBO_drogon_and_Jon.jpg|thumb|Drogon allows Jon to pet him.]]
The [[King in the North]] [[Jon Snow]] is walking on the grounds of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] island when the Dragon Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] arrives on the back of her [[dragon]] [[Drogon]]. Drogon roars at Jon at first and stretches out his head to face the King in the North. Drogon calms down and recognizes Jon as a friend of his master (and possibly sensing his Targaryen ancestry?), allowing him to stroke his snout, much to Dany's surprise. When Jon Snow (under slight duress) agrees that the dragons are beautiful beasts, Dany responds that the dragons are her children. When Jon Snow observes that she was not gone for long, Daenerys curtly replies that no she wasn't, and she now has fewer enemies to deal with.

Daenerys then asks Jon about the [[Battle of the Bastards]] and him "[[Mutiny at Castle Black|taking a knife in the heart for his people]]". Jon deflects this and replies that [[Davos Seaworth]] likes to embellish things. Their conversation is interrupted by the return of a recently-healed [[Jorah Mormont]]. Daenerys introduces Jorah to Jon, who says he worked under [[Jeor Mormont|Jorah's father]] in the [[Night's Watch]]. When Jorah reaffirms his allegiance to her, she accepts his offer of service and hugs him.
[[File:Tyrion and Varys Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Varys compares Daenerys to Aerys. ]]
Later, Tyrion and [[Varys]] talk about the deaths of Randyll and his son Dickon in the Reach. Varys tells Tyrion about how he distanced himself from the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]'s role in killing [[Rickard Stark]] and his son [[Brandon Stark]]. Tyrion continues to insist that Daenerys is not her father, and Varys agrees up to a point: Dany may not have her father's madness, but she certainly has a growing ruthless streak, which in Varys' view must be curtailed by Tyrion's more pragmatic counsel. They discuss a sealed scroll containing [[Bran Stark]]'s message from the [[North]] – which Varys of course, read.

Later, at the Chamber of the [[Painted Table]], Jon tells Daenerys about the news of his half-brother Bran and half-sister Arya Stark's return to Winterfell. He wants to go home to Winterfell, concerned by Bran's vision which warns the army of the dead are getting closer and Jon is worried the undead army will make it past the Wall and advance on the North. Dany notes that Jon doesn't have enough men to fight the army of the dead and Jon asks her again to join him. However, Dany is worried that Cersei will take advantage and march in if she turns her focus to the army of the dead. Tyrion is present and proposes bringing a wight south to King's Landing in order to prove that the army of the dead is real and convince [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen]] Cersei Lannister, so they can come to a truce. Varys opines that it is suicide trying to appeal to Cersei but Tyrion argues that he can persuade his brother Jaime.
[[File:705 Davos Jon.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Davos and Jon prepare to depart to Eastwatch.]]
Davos, as the only one who might be able to smuggle Tyrion into King's Landing, reluctantly agrees, but also thinks such a mission is risky even for a smuggler like him. Jorah volunteers to go north to help capture a Wight while Jon volunteers to lead the expedition, since the Free Folk won't follow Jorah and he is the only one who has the most experience facing their enemy. Apparently on the verge of tears about the idea of Jon leaving, Daenerys responds that she did not give Jon permission to leave but Jon reminds her that he is the King in the North. He tells her she has the power of life and death over him but that he trusted her even though she was a stranger. He pleads with her to return the favor by trusting him. Later, Davos and Tyrion chat about smuggling before embarking on their mission to infiltrate King's Landing. Davos plans to find [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] while Tyrion wants to secretly meet with Jaime to find a peaceful solution to the war.
[[File:Dany and Jorah Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys bid farewell to Jorah.]]
Davos and Tyrion return with Gendry to Dragonstone. At the [[dragonglass]] mines, they meet Jon Snow, who is supervising the diggings and excavations. Gendry remarks that Jon is a lot shorter than he expected – and immediately blurts out his true parentage, on the assumption that Jon will value honesty and will appreciate the idea of Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon's bastards joining forces. Gendry volunteers to accompany Jon on his mission to the North to capture a wight and convince Queen Daenerys and Queen Cersei that the [[Great War|true war]] lies to the North. As Jon Snow and his party, including Jorah Mormont prepare to depart on boats for [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], Dany and her entourage arrive to bid them farewell. Dany quips to Jorah that they should be used to saying farewell to each other. Jon arrives at the beach as they are saying goodbye. Jon playfully quips to Daenerys that if their mission is unsuccessful and he doesn’t return she at least won’t have to deal with the King in the North anymore. Dany responds that she’s "grown used to him", hinting that she may have feelings for him. Jon wishes her good fortune in the wars to come before he leaves. Dany and Tyrion watch as Jon Snow and his party depart on their boats for Eastwatch.

=== In King's Landing ===
[[File:705 Jaime.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Jaime returns to King's Landing.]]
Jaime returns to King's Landing to inform Cersei of the defeat. He flatly insists that the Lannisters have no chance of defeating Daenerys, even ''if'' Cersei were able to buy enough mercenaries to replace their huge losses; [[Qyburn]]'s scorpion did little more than anger Drogon, and neither the Lannister soldiers nor any mercenaries will be able to match the huge horde of [[Dothraki]], who Jaime notes killed their men as if it were sport to them, not war. Cersei snidely asks Jaime if they are expected to surrender to a Queen whose [[Iron Throne|throne]] Cersei occupies and whose father Jaime betrayed and murdered, mockingly remarking that Tyrion could intercede for them with Daenerys as an apology for killing Joffrey and Tywin.
[[File:705 Cersei Lannister.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Cersei is told of Olenna's role in Joffrey's murder.]]
Jaime reveals to Cersei that Tyrion is innocent of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s murder, telling her [[Olenna Tyrell]] confessed to it. Cersei is dismissive of Tyrion's innocence in all things as usual, so Jaime has to talk her through it, asking her rhetorically if Olenna would prefer Margaery to marry the strong-willed and sadistic Joffrey or the emotionally pliable and good-natured [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Effectively, Olenna would have become the true ruler of the Seven kingdoms behind the scenes - in the same way that their father [[Tywin Lannister]] became the true ruler of Westeros through his grandsons. Feeling cheated of yet another vengeance, Cersei can barely contain her fury as she laments listening to Jaime, saying Olenna ought to have died screaming. Jaime says she's dead, nonetheless, along with the rest of House Tyrell, and that they will go the same way unless they are careful. Jaime sees no other path to victory; Tyrion now stands against his own siblings with a foreign invader possessed of a large, fearsome army and three ferocious dragons. Cersei dismisses his protests, however, making it plain she intends to fight to the death rather than surrender her throne, and expects the same from Jaime and the rest of the Lannister military.
[[File:Tyrion and Jaime Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion reunites with Jaime.]]
Later, beneath the [[Red Keep]], Bronn purports to lead Jaime to a sparring session amongst the skulls of the Targaryen dragons, only for him to discover it is really a secret meeting with his estranged brother Tyrion. Jaime is initially angry that Bronn has arranged the secret meeting. Tyrion compliments Jaime on shrewdly and unsentimentally abandoning the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] seat of [[Casterly Rock]], while Jaime wishes him dead for killing their father Tywin. Snapping, an emotional Tyrion points out that their father knew he was innocent but still condemned him to death nonetheless, having hated him all his life for being born a dwarf. When Jaime demands to know what Tyrion wants, the dwarf responds that Jaime knows that Daenerys will win the [[Last War]] and tells him that Daenerys is willing to make peace with Cersei under certain conditions. He tells Jaime about Daenerys's terms.
[[File:Gendry Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Gendry is found.]]
Meanwhile, Davos visits [[Flea Bottom]] and eventually finds [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] in a smithy on the Street of Steel. Joking that he thought Gendry might still be rowing by then, Gendry confirms that no one has given him a second glance and realizes that Davos has come to bring him for something important. Having never been happy with serving the [[House Lannister|family]] who murdered his [[Robert Baratheon|father]] and tried to kill him, Gendry explains that he's been preparing for such a moment and readily agrees to come with him. When Davos warns it will be dangerous and that he should take one of the swords in the shop, Gendry points out he was never taught to fight properly and is only good with a hammer... retrieving from the back of the shop a war hammer, a maul with a stag's head design on either side of the haft socket (likely forged himself and referencing his [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] roots).

Later on the shores of [[Blackwater Bay]], Davos and Gendry, having placed his hammer in Davos' boat, prepare to leave but are spotted by a pair of [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]]. Davos pretends to be a common smuggler and bribes the guards with coin. He strikes up a conversation with the guards and on being asked about his cargo, he shows them he is transporting fermented crab, an aphrodisiac that is popular with the city's brothels. He uncovers the crab while pulling the cloth aside to hide the war hammer and gives each guard a sample. The guards are satisfied, if slightly disgusted, with Davos's explanation and bribe and prepare to depart, but Tyrion arrives at that exact moment; realizing it's too late to turn back and not look suspicious, Tyrion walks past them to the boat while looking downward. However, one of the guards recognizes Tyrion by his scar and asks him to stop. They realize that he is indeed Tyrion Lannister, and immediately see through Davos' deception. With their backs to Gendry and the boat and before they can react, he kills them both by smashing their skulls in with his hammer. Davos, slightly exasperated, introduces Gendry to Tyrion, who wryly observes "he'll do".
[[File:Got_Cersei_and_Jaime_Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|Cersei reveals she is pregnant.]]
Later, at the Red Keep, [[Qyburn]] is visiting Cersei when Jaime enters her chambers. Jaime tells Cersei that he met with Tyrion. When Cersei asks if Daenerys wants to negotiate a surrender, Jaime tells her that Dany is seeking an armistice due to the threat posed by the army of the dead. Cersei knows that Bronn secretly organized the meeting between Tyrion and Jaime. Cersei says that perhaps an alliance with Daenerys may be a wiser move, but she still retains her determination to destroy any force that stands against her. She also asks if Jaime plans to punish Bronn for arranging the clandestine meeting with Tyrion. Cersei then reveals that she is pregnant with another of Jaime's children, and after reflecting on their late father's advice that "the lion does not concern himself with the opinions of the sheep", Cersei hugs Jaime and whispers in his ear that he is never to betray her again.

=== At Eastwatch-by-the-Sea ===
After landing at Eastwatch, Jon Snow and his band meet with the [[Free Folk|wildling]] [[Tormund]], who thinks that Jon's plan is suicidal, and mockingly asks which of the two ferocious Queens is it they need to convince (Jon replies both). Davos volunteers to stay behind at Eastwatch because he regards himself as a liability, given his age and relative lack of fighting ability. They later learn that the Night's Watch has detained members of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] including [[Beric Dondarrion]], [[Thoros]] and [[Sandor Clegane]]. Jon and his team meet with the prisoners in the icy cells beneath Eastwatch, where the entire group swiftly establishes their reasons for hating each other. Gendry opines that they should not trust Thoros because the Brotherhood sold him to the [[Melisandre|Red Witch]], raising Davos and Jon's hackles. Thoros, in turn, is surprised to see Jorah, an old comrade and rival from the [[Siege of Pyke]].
[[File:Game-of-thrones-the-magnificent-seven-jon-snow-tormund-davos-gendry-the-hound-thoros-jorah-baric-eastwatch.jpg|thumb|180x180px|The Wight Hunt begins.]]
While the Wildlings, Mormont, and the Brotherhood Without Banners distrust each other, they decide to put aside their differences to fight against the army of the dead. Sandor quips that the cells are freezing. After they are freed, Jon, Jorah, Tormund, Gendry, Sandor, Beric, and Thoros exit Eastwatch's gate and set out into the lands beyond the Wall on their dangerous mission to capture a Wight to bring to Daenerys and Cersei.

==Behind the scenes==
===General===
*The episode title is a reference to the castle and port of [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], one of only three manned castles left on the [[Wall]]. As the only castle on the Wall located on the sea and the closest to [[Hardhome]], it is the most likely place that the [[White Walkers]] would attack.
*The [[Opening credits (Game of Thrones)|opening credits]] have been updated from last episode, replacing [[Pyke]] with a new animation for Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
*Following the hype from the battle in the preceding episode, the live viewership ratings for "Eastwatch" also surpassed it to once again break all-time viewership ratings for the TV series: in terms of Nielsen ratings (which don't include streaming services or DVR) 10.72 million people watched this episode live, surpassing the 10.2 million for the preceding episode "The Spoils of War", and up from the 10.1 million rating for the Season 7 premiere "Dragonstone".<ref>[ http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-breaks-viewership-record-episode-705/ ]</ref>
**Similarly, this episode also broke the day-after site visit numbers for ''Game of Thrones Wiki'' set by those episodes, with 5.1 million - up from 4.6 million for "The Spoils of War" - which actually makes it the second-highest traffic day on the wiki ''of all time'', officially surpassing the 4.8 million day-after site visits for Season 6's "[[The Door]]" (the episode that [[Hodor]] died). The highest site visit to date above this episode was the Season 6 finale, which jumped to 9.1 million site hits (possibly due to the reveal of Jon Snow's real parentage).

===In the Reach===
*[[Daenerys Targaryen]] once again uses her speech (from Season 5's "[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]") that she's going to "break the wheel" of one conqueror replacing another in wars like a wheel going around, but society never advances because each ruler is as bad as the last and keeps oppressing everyone under them. This metaphor hasn't been used in the novels, and indeed, the idea that Daenerys has some grand hope of reforming all of society is an invention of the TV series - she does want to stop things like slavery and overthrow bad rulers, but fundamentally, she does want to be the hereditary monarch over everyone else.
**Daenerys’s speech is similar to the speech she made to the slaves at [[Meereen]] before launching the broken slave collars into the city (“[[Breaker of Chains]]”). She was not responding to the lies and half-truths, instead she relied on evidence of her power and using that to win people over instead.
*Tyrion's own dialogue specifically questions why [[Randyll Tarly]] won't submit to Daenerys Targaryen, given that he fought ''for'' her own father during [[Robert's Rebellion]] (famously winning the only Targaryen victory of the war, at the [[Battle of Ashford]]), and that Cersei hasn't even been his queen for long, in fact she got the throne by ''killing'' his rightful queen ([[Margaery Tyrell]]). Randyll acknowledges that while Daenerys might be Aerys II Targaryen's daughter, she's just a foreigner to him as she did not grow up in Westeros (Daenerys was taken into exile to the [[Free Cities]] shortly after her birth on Dragonstone), and who brought the [[Dothraki]] ("foreign savages") to Westeros. He also makes it clear that he hates Cersei and only served her grudgingly as what he perceived as the lesser of two evils.
**In the books, such attitudes are not entirely without precedent, specifically during the later [[Blackfyre Rebellion]]s. The first rebellion was a civil war fought by internal factions in Westeros, but after [[House Blackfyre]] lost, its survivors fled into exile in the Free Cities, and for the next 50 years they sporadically launched four subsequent rebellions. While there they founded the [[Golden Company]] to be their core fighting force (which Cersei actually mentioned in the previous episode). By the fourth rebellion, forty years after the first, they were surprised to have very little support from within Westeros itself - even noble Houses who ''had'' supported the Blackfyres in the earlier rebellions did not come out to fight for them: by that point, they weren't actually fighting for [[Daemon Blackfyre]], but for his grandson they had never heard of, who wasn't born in Westeros, nor had he ever spent a day of his life in Westeros, and the Blackfyres were leading an army of foreign mercenaries.
**Note the contrast between Randyll's attitudes towards Daenerys, and how other characters are judged by the reputation of their fathers, such as Jorah Mormont and Gendry. Samwell and Jon felt that they owed Jorah simply because [[Jeor Mormont|Jorah's father]] saved their lives, while Tormund was angry at Jorah for his father fighting the wildlings. Jon trusts Gendry because their fathers were allies. Other characters outright condemn Daenerys as "the Mad King's daughter" without even knowing her. For Randyll, however, Daenerys's lineage meant nothing either way - with no loyalty to her father's rule ''or'' vilification of her for it. He bluntly said that she's just a stranger to him, who's never been in Westeros before, invading with a foreign army.
**Randyll Tarly also makes it clear that he won't submit to Daenerys because he is disgusted with Tyrion - a man who, admittedly, killed [[Tywin Lannister|his own father]]. [[Kinslaying]] carries a heavy stigma in Westeros, and a son killing his own father (with premeditation) is officially the absolute worst kind of kinslaying, regardless of what his father did to provoke it.
**Randyll brings up [[Assassinations in the Tower of the Hand|Tywin's death]], and his own death is in notable contrast with it. When Tyrion confronted Tywin with a crossbow while he was on the privy, he started trying to explain his way out of the situation, then daring Tyrion on, thinking Tyrion couldn't possibly kill him, despite all of the abuse he had heaped upon him. Randyll, meanwhile, faces death with dignity, and would rather die than accept Tyrion's offer to try to have his life spared by taking the black. Moreover, Tywin mistreated his son so badly his entire life that it ultimately drove his son to kill him, while when Randyll is executed, his son Dickon ''voluntarily'' asks to be executed with him, even though Randyll tells him not to, thinking it would be dishonorable to outlive his father.
**Randyll's reasons for supporting Cersei, but not Daenerys, are hypocritical:
***He accuses Tyrion of kinslaying - but "forgets" that Cersei is also a kinslayer, and so is Jaime; the former killed their [[Kevan Lannister|uncle]] and [[Lancel Lannister|cousin]], and the latter killed another [[Alton Lannister|cousin]].
****Randyll's hypocrisy is underscored by the fact that he threatened to kill his eldest son Samwell if he didn't join the Night's Watch - and he meant it. Of course, Randyll never actually ''carried out'' his threatened kinslaying, while the Lannister siblings ''did''.
***He accuses Daenerys of bringing an army of savages to Westeros - but "forgets" the [[Sack of King's Landing|savage atrocities]] that the Lannisters' bannermen ([[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] and [[Amory Lorch|Lorch]]) have performed in Westeros.
***He also "forgets" that the Lannisters are to blame of oathbreaking and violation of the guest right, and they deal with their enemies by using despicable methods - and not long ago he himself blamed Jaime and Cersei of committing all of those ("[[Stormborn]]"). 
*Daenerys's words to Randyll and Dickon "I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of My Name, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die" - echo Eddard Stark's words to [[Will|the deserter]] from the first episode "[[Winter Is Coming]]": "I, Eddard of the House Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, sentence you to die".
**[[Brienne of Tarth]] used a similiar speech when she executed [[Stannis Baratheon]] ("[[Mother's Mercy]]").
*[[House Tarly]] wouldn't be extinct even if [[Samwell Tarly]] doesn't take up its rule due to his vows as a member of the [[Night's Watch]]. In Season 6's "[[Blood of My Blood]]", when the rest of House Tarly was introduced at [[Horn Hill]], Samwell's sister [[Talla Tarly]] was also introduced into the TV continuity (he has more sisters in the books, but Talla is the only named one). Throughout Westeros, daughters do inherit if they have no eligible surviving brothers, i.e. excluding brothers who gave up their right to inheritance by joining orders such as the maesters, Night's Watch, or Kingsguard.
**Samwell never actually took a maester's vows. He studied for a time but then left without actually joining - [[Oberyn Martell]] was stated to have done the same thing back in Season 4. Nonetheless, he is still bound by his vows in the Night's Watch. As already explained in Season 5, however, a monarch has the power to release a man from his vows to the Night's Watch - typically in just these situations, when all of the man's male relatives died, and he needed to leave the Watch to keep his family's male line alive. [[Stannis Baratheon]] offered to simply decree that Jon Snow was released from his vows to the Night's Watch so he could legally lead House Stark (later, Jon leaves the Watch after his death and resurrection, saying that he fulfilled his vows as he served the Watch until his death). This has only happened a few times over the centuries, and while technically legal, has always been controversial - Jon actually declined Stannis's offer because he thought no one would take him seriously as head of House Stark if he would so easily set aside his vows to the Watch.
**If the White Walkers are permanently defeated in the upcoming Great War and ''if'' they don't kill everyone in Westeros, of course, there might no longer be a need for a Night's Watch, and Samwell would be free to leave and rule House Tarly - though that's a very big "if".
*Tyrion and [[Varys]] express their concern that burning the Tarlys will make Daenerys seem like her father, the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], who burned his enemies alive in the throne room. In the Inside the Episode video, showrunner David Benioff said that Daenerys isn't supposed to be outright vindictive or crazy, but ruthlessly rational, and it's supposed to be unclear if she or Tyrion are correct. In her view, she gave Tarly a fair choice about whether to surrender or not, several chances to bend the knee and he refused knowing what would happen, and his execution helped convince other wavering Lannister survivors to bend the knee.
**It seem unfair to compare Daenerys's actions to those of her father, as the Mad King was a sadist who enjoyed the suffering of his victims, in the books he is even described as being sexually aroused by their suffering while they were being burned. In contrast, Daenerys only uses fire as a means to an end, to show her power over dragons and prompt her enemies to bend the knee like Aegon did during the Conquest of Westeros centuries before her. She is not taking any pleasure in their death, as highlighted by how her utterance of "Dracarys" is more solemn and soft than usual. By the same token, execution by dragon-fire, while "longer" and more painful than a simple beheading, is still swifter than burning someone at the stake and letting the fires slowly consume them, which the Mad King was known to do. Simply put, it took Randyll and Dickon far less time to die than Rickard Stark. Such subtleties, however, might have escaped from the spectators. Perhaps it would have been preferable for Daenerys to execute Randyll and Dickon by beheading, to make a point without being associated with her father.
**Tyrion begs Daenerys to give Randyll the option of taking the black and joining the [[Night's Watch]] - which has always been customary for defeated lords in Westeros for centuries. It's unknown if Daenerys would have given him the option or not, but it's a moot point, because Randyll then interjected that he wouldn't join the Night's Watch even if she did extend the offer.
**Tyrion's suggestion to imprison Randyll, hoping that spending several weeks in jail will make him change his mind about surrendering, is perhaps a reference to the way Jon deals with Arnolf Karstark's son Cregan in the fifth novel. After learning from Alys about Arnolf's treachery toward Stannis and when Cregan comes to Castle Black to forcibly take Alys away against her will, Jon imprisons Cregan, who did come to forcibly take Alys so he could marry her to Arnolf against her will. Jon gives Cregan a chance to yield; Cregan refuses, makes idle threats and claims he will never yield. Jon decides not to kill Cregan (because the Watch is supposed to remain neutral in respect of political affairs of the realm), and keeps him imprisoned, after warning him that spending time in an ice cell will make him change his mind; if he does not, Stannis will execute him.
*This episode doesn't give any new insights into where exactly the [[Battle of the Goldroad|battle in the preceding episode]] took place. Jaime and Bronn are washed by the current farther down the river, yet are still not within sight of King's Landing - which seem to indicate that it wasn't the [[Roseroad]]/[[Kingsroad]] crossing (which has no fords or even a bridge). Other materials state the river is indeed the [[Blackwater Rush]], so the battle seems to have taken place farther up it to the west, apparently at the [[Goldroad]] crossing.
*The beginning of the episode reveals that Jaime and [[Bronn]] somehow survived drowning, despite the former wearing plate armor, and were washed downriver before pulling themselves up to shore. Reports from early episode outlines vaguely seem to indicate that the idea is they nearly drowned, but the current was strong enough that it washed them farther downstream into a shallower stretch of the river.
*[[Bronn]]'s exact reasons for continuing to serve the Lannisters despite the fact that they still hadn't given him the full reward they'd promised were brought up in the preceding episode - that they'd given him gold, but not a marriage into the nobility and a castle - but he directly explains his position in this episode. He's already done a lot of work for the Lannisters, they admit that in theory they owe him, but no one ''else'' will give him a reward for past things he already did for the Lannisters. Moreover, he was willing to help them when they were winning, but he bluntly tells Jaime that if Daenerys uses her dragons again, that will be the limit at which he simply abandons them. Later in the episode, he's actually falling back into helping ''Tyrion'' set up a meeting with Jaime, so he might already be sending out feelers to end up on the winning side.
*'''Multiple characters in this episode confirm that [[House Tyrell]] is officially extinct,''' in the TV continuity. In the books, there are numerous cousins from younger branches of the family who probably wouldn't be killed in one fell swoop. Thus it was unclear if any others survived after the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]]. The TV continuity has officially simplified that now, at least, there are no survivors - apparently making the tacit assumption that any other relatives died off-screen during the [[Sack of Highgarden]]. Tyrion says that Cersei "Destroyed House Tyrell for all time" and that "this war has already wiped one great House out of existence". Jaime later says that the Tyrells are "extinct" now, as well.
**The [[Reach]] is left with no clear overall leader after this. The Tyrells fought for Daenerys, then the Tarlys helped wipe out the Tyrells with the promise of being made the new [[Warden of the South]] - specifically Lord Randyll. With the Tarly army crushed, it's doubtful that Cersei would bestow the empty reward of the title on whoever Randyll's new heir is (Samwell or Talla). Whichever side wins the war will eventually have to raise up a new House to rule, much as the Tyrells replaced [[House Gardener]] after the Targaryen Conquest. Possible candidates are [[House Florent]], who have a strong bloodlink to House Gardener, and [[House Redwyne]], Olenna's birth house.
**The status of [[House Martell]] and [[Dorne]], however, is still left ambiguous. [[Oberyn Martell]] has five younger bastard daughters, as the TV continuity also mentioned that as in the books there were eight [[Sand Snakes]] altogether. The [[Coup in Dorne]] was an invention of the TV series, killing off [[Doran Martell]] and his son Trystane, while never introducing Doran's other two children from the books. Even with the three introduced Sand Snakes dead, and with Ellaria a prisoner (the actress confirmed she will not reappear), these other five daughters should still be alive (among them [[Elia Sand]], named in dialogue), who never left Dorne in the first place. Dorne's armies ever never even attacked and must "exist" - Ellaria's ship was attacked on its way ''to Dorne'' to pick up Dorne's armies. ''Someone'' must be ruling Dorne at this point - though another possible explanation would be that without Ellaria, Dorne's lords have fallen into chaos ([[House Yronwood]] has historically seized any opportunity to rebel against the Martells). Nonetheless, the TV series has made no mention of such a possibility, to the point of outright ''avoiding'' further discussion of Dorne.
**Tyrion phrased it that "this war" had wiped out "one great House" already. As far as Tyrion is aware, [[House Baratheon]] is extinct as well, because he doesn't know about Gendry. It's possible that he's drawing a distinction between "this war", Daenerys's invasion, and the "War of the Five Kings" that preceded it as a separate war.
**More uncertain is why Tyrion didn't include [[House Martell]] in that count either, even though Ellaria and the three Sand Snakes have been dispatched as well. There are two possible scenarios, which the TV writers may have simply never devoted thought to: the first is that this confirms the younger Sand Snakes are in fact alive, but doesn't explain why they don't just send Dorne's armies to help Daenerys. The second possibly is that, being bastards, Ellaria and the Sand Snakes were not considered to be "House Martell", and that like the Baratheons, Tyrion considers "House Martell" (Doran and Trystane) to have been killed off in the preceding War of the Five Kings. Ultimately, the situation in Dorne remains unconfirmed.

===At Winterfell===
*The opening shot of [[Bran Stark]] using his [[Warg|warging]] powers to enter the minds of [[raven]]s follows through on [[Brynden Rivers]]'s promise in the Season 4 finale ("[[The Children]]") that he would never walk again, but he would learn to fly.
*Arya's behavior could be influenced by her training at the [[House of Black and White]]. [[Faceless Men]] are assassins who kill targets without fail. Sansa has had to navigate the gray/grey areas of compromise. She has had to ally and negotiate while determining a person's motive.
*The Northern lords, and particularly the Vale lords, question if they should have made [[Sansa Stark]] the Queen in the North because Jon has been away for so long, not dealing with their immediate concerns. As others have pointed out, Bran is Ned Stark's last trueborn son and thus should rank ahead of Jon (an illegitimate son) and Sansa (a daughter) in line of succession - but Bran has essentially indicated that he wants to abdicate, saying he's the "[[Three-Eyed Raven]]" now and will never be lord of anything. Apparently, this is why no one brings up the issue of Sansa usurping Bran - she is next in line after Bran and would inherit all of his titles. Of course, no one is aware that Jon is really the son of Ned's younger sister [[Lyanna Stark]], and Sansa would outrank Jon in the line of inheritance to Winterfell even if he wasn't an illegitimate son (as seemingly indicated by the journal entry that Gilly stumbles across).
*The lords in the council say there has never been a "Queen in the North" before.  Actually, this has been confirmed by George R.R. Martin himself [http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Various_questions_concerning_Tywin_Oberyn_Gregor_the_North_and_Sansa in Q&A.]  According to legend, [[House Stark]] has ruled Winterfell since the [[Long Night]], ''8,000 years ago'', which makes this somewhat surprising - possibly due to the constant threat of wildling invasions, their inheritance practices focused on the closest adult male warrior, etc.  Little is known about their inheritance laws:  male-preference primogeniture is said to be "Andal law", not First Men law.
**Though there has never been a "ruling queen" (inherited in her own right), this does bely the fact that there have quite probably been [[Regent|Queen Regents]], who may have practically been the real rulers in all but name for years (i.e. like with Cersei and her under-aged son Tommen).  One of the upcoming ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' prequel novellas, set some 90 years before the main novels, will deal with the "She-wolves of Winterfell" - a time period when multiple Stark lords died in rapid succession, and their widows jockeyed for power during a regency.  Otherwise, it's unknown how common female monarchs were in the rest of the Seven Kingdoms (besides Dorne, which had many due to gender-blind inheritance laws).  The only mention of it in ''The World of Ice & Fire'' is that the [[Reach|Kingdom of the Reach]] had ''exactly'' one female monarch in its entire history.  
*Sansa argues with Arya about how to handle the Northern and Vale lords - with Arya bluntly saying she thinks a few executions for treason would keep them in line, while Sansa says that there's more to "ruling" than that, and beheadings aren't how you get people to work together, combining their strength towards a common goal. This has shadows of Sansa's original Vale story arc in the novels - which Season 4 seemed to be setting up, only to then merge Sansa into the Bolton storyline in the north (in which [[Ramsay Bolton]] rapes his wife - Sansa never even meets the Boltons in the novels). Instead, Sansa stays in the Vale with Littlefinger, gradually winning over the support of more and more of the Vale lords, through a combination of bribes, funding younger sons to take over Houses that won't come over to their side, and various other subtle political manipulations. [[George R.R. Martin]] himself highlighted in a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0iNPkx8vnE promotional video for Season 4] - describing Sansa's story arc through the fourth novel - that Sansa doesn't have a sword like Arya, but her skill and strength [[Battle of the Bastards|isn't at killing people herself]], but as a political player in the wider "game of thrones". She's better at the courtly niceties and subtle social manipulations which are needed to be a cunning ruler. As Martin put it, the real "players in the game of thrones" aren't the pieces who can use a sword, but those who can manipulate ''other people'' around to do what they want, making them their pawns.
**Thus, if Sansa and Arya reunite in the next novel, there may be some loose parallel that Arya just wants to immediately kill lords who start to rival them, while Sansa is a better political player, and argues against Arya's methods because she wants to gradually win their opponents back into allegiance.
*If you look closely, the fireplace behind Sansa in the main hall scene is decorated with a pattern of Stark [[direwolf]] sigils in the stonework.
*To be clear, as Sansa is walking down a corridor with Arya in Winterfell, she doesn't say that Jon expected the Northern lords "to wait here like a ghost". The line is a little muffled, but subtitles confirm she said that Jon expected the lords to "sit and wait here like [[Ghost]]", that is, his [[direwolf]]. Bryan Cogman confirmed that a scene of Jon saying goodbye to Ghost before he left in "[[Stormborn]]" was filmed, but cut for time. Thus Ghost hasn't actually appeared yet in Season 7.
*Sansa accurately recounts that the Starks won back the north and defeated the Boltons with the support of [[House Mormont]], [[House Hornwood]], and the wildlings. The disparity of [[House Glover]] only having 500 men left, while [[House Royce]] has 2,000, is probably illustrative of how badly depleted the North's armies are after many years of war, while the Vale armies are still quite fresh (and the Royces are one of the most powerful Houses in all of the Vale, while the Glovers are of middling power in the North over lightly populated forest lands).
*Simply pausing on the shot of the letter Arya finds in Littlefinger's chamber reveals that it is the letter that Sansa herself sent to Winterfell back in Season 1, while being manipulated by Cersei, begging Robb to surrender the North in exchange for their father Ned's life. Robb later received the letter at Winterfell (in "[[The Pointy End]]"), and Maester [[Luwin]] confirmed that it was authentic as it was Sansa's own handwriting - but that she was clearly quoting words that Cersei told her to write. This prompted Robb to call all his bannermen and march south to war. Maester [[Wolkan]] obtained the letter for Littlefinger from Maester Luwin's archives, and this was set up earlier this season in "[[The Queen's Justice]]" when Wolkan told Sansa that Luwin saved an extensive archive of every written letter the castle had ever received.
*[[Adele Smyth-Kennedy]], who plays the [[Winterfell spy]] to whom Littlefinger talks, is actually one of [[Emilia Clarke]]'s stand-in doubles (for wide-shots, pickup-shots from behind, etc.).

=== In Oldtown ===
*The journal that Gilly reads claims that Rhaegar sought an annulment from his wife [[Elia Martell]] - with whom he already had two small children, including a son. "[[Marriage]]" does not work like that in Westeros. "Divorce" does not exist, only "annulment" of a marriage for specific reasons: such as if the marriage was never consummated, if one of them was already married to someone else, or if the spouse was unable to conceive an heir, etc. What is being described here is ''divorce'', not "annulment", which it would be impossible for Rhaegar to obtain for a wife who already bore him two small children (one of them a boy, so he couldn't even have been setting her aside to seek a male heir).
**No one knows exactly what will be revealed about Rhaegar in future novels, but a major theory is that Rhaegar simply intended to polygamously marry Lyanna Stark as his second wife. The Valyrians were known to practice polygamy, and in the original Conquest-generation of the Targaryens, Aegon the Conqueror was ''simultaneously'' married to both of his sisters. The [[Faith Militant]] later warred with his son [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] over this, and while never giving up their incestuous marriages (they already had an incestuous bloodline), the Targaryens promised to never practice polygamy again. However, a significant hint in ''The World of Ice & Fire'' was a potential explanation for why [[Daemon Blackfyre]] went to war with his brother out of love for his half-sister, even though he was already married to someone else. An in-universe theory that several historians have is that Daemon simply intended to revive the Targaryen custom of polygamy - or somehow, thought he could get away with it despite it being banned for nearly 200 years. It's possible that Rhaegar, like Daemon Blackfyre, thought he could get away with polygamy in secret. In which case, Rhaegar's "annulment" of his marriage to Elia would be a drastic oversimplification of what really happened in the books.
**For that matter, there is ''no precedent'' for a lord getting an "annulment" from a wife who already gave him a male heir - it is impossible, as this would be a "divorce" - and thus there is no precedent for what would happen to Rhaegar's two children by that first marriage. It's possible that the TV writers simply didn't think out the implications of this change. Rhaegar could only ask for an "annulment" by claiming that Elia's first two children weren't actually fathered by him - but there's no evidence he claimed that either. Given that this might not even occur in the novels, '''it is unclear if Aegon and Rhaenys should be treated as bastards or not''' (be it Targaryen or Martell bastards), or if the TV writers still intend for them to be Rhaegar's legitimate children. Ironically, this causes so many contradictions that it would have been easier to quickly explain that Rhaegar wanted a second, polygamous marriage.
**In the novels, Elia Martell is believed to be barren after the difficult births of her two children. Rhaegar could possibly use this as an argument despite the fact that his wife already gave him a suitable heir. Rhaegar believed that the [[Prince That Was Promised|prince that was promised]] prophecy was, in fact, referring to a triarchy of Targaryens and needed another child. Thus it wouldn't make sense for Rhaegar to de-legitimize his first two children, when he wanted a set of three.
**Moreover, if Rhaegar did secretly get an annulment in the books, it was also a poor political move as the Martells were staunch allies of House Targaryen during Robert's Rebellion due to one of their own being part of House Targaryen through marriage. Given that the Martells were furious at Rhaegar for humiliating Elia twice in public (at the tourney of Harrenhal and by "kidnapping" Lyanna), it is likely that repudiating his wife and consequently disowning his Targaryen/Martell children would have enraged the Martells much more, had they discovered it. The fact of almost certainly losing the allegiance of a key ally in a time of war, could explain why Rhaegar kept it secret
*One way or another, books or TV series, whether Rhaegar got an annulment or simply married Lyanna Stark as his second wife, this episode reveals that Rhaegar was indeed married to Lyanna - meaning that '''Jon Snow is the real legitimate heir to the Iron Throne'''. Rhaegar was Daenerys's older brother, so as Rhaegar's lawful son, "Jon Snow" ranks ahead of her in the line of succession - he even ranked ahead of Rhaegar's younger brother Viserys. This also means that his legal surname is in fact "Targaryen". Lyanna's dying words to Eddard in the Season 6 finale flashback also all but stated that "Jon" isn't even his real first name, that his parents intended for him, but a cover name that Eddard came up with (apparently Jon's real name is obviously a Targaryen-style one).
*In response to the episode, Elio Garcia and Linda Antonsson, owners of major book fansite Westeros.org and co-authors with George R.R. Martin of ''The World of Ice & Fire'' sourcebook, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZTfVpNnRQo put out an analysis video] specifically devoted to the TV series saying Rhaegar got an "annulment". While acknowledging that no one currently knows exactly what Rhaegar did, they heavily criticized the idea that he got an "annulment", and suspect it is an extreme condensation of the TV series - one that creates more plot holes than it solves, for all the above reasons: they strongly suspect that Rhaegar ''polygamously'' married Lyanna as a second wife, and "annulment" doesn't work like that in Westeros. They did, however, address several related points:
**They suspected that this was an attempt by the showrunners to make no question of Jon Snow's legitimacy as Rhaegar's heir, when his claim would ''always'' be subject to question - even in this scenario for the TV series. The question of legitimacy was a frequent cause of major wars in the real Middle Ages, and both sides would often claim legal loopholes to try to discredit their rivals' legitimacy (i.e. Henry V claiming rule over France due to "Salic Law" inheritance). This isn't a matter of what is legalistically right - each side would try to interpret the situation to their benefit. If Rhaegar polygamously married Lyanna, Jon's enemies would say that this marriage was unlawful (because the Faith has never acknowledged them). Rhaegar annulling his marriage to Elia first wouldn't solve this problem - Jon's enemies can just claim that Rhaegar's ''annulment'' was unlawful (making his second marriage bigamous and Jon a bastard).
**They reaffirmed that "annulment" doesn't work like this in Westeros: it isn't given to a man whose wife already produced heirs for him (like how in real life, Henry VIII wanted to annul/divorce Katherine of Aragon even though she already gave him a daughter). It has been repeatedly explained even in the TV series that Sansa's marriage to Tyrion can be set aside specifically because it was never consummated. It would have been easier to just claim that divorce exists in Westeros in the TV continuity.
**In real life, laws about divorce, bastardy, and legitimacy changed considerably over the course of the Middle Ages: in earlier centuries little emphasis was put on issues of bastardy, but as the Catholic Church grew in power and stressed it, this became a major issue for succession law by the 1400's (and the War of the Five Kings is based on the Wars of the Roses from the 1400's). English Common Law diverged from the "Canon Law" of the Church which was followed in the rest of Western Europe, however, and Martin has remarked that Westeros's laws and customs are loosely inspired by English Common Law. Many people who were considered legitimate under Canon Law were considered bastards under English Common Law. Under Common Law, if someone's parents only married after they were born, they were still a bastard; moreover, unlike modern "divorce", under Common Law, and "annulment" retroactively meant that the marriage was never real, and thus any lawful children produced in a marriage that got annulled were retroactively declared bastards.
**At the same time, Elio and Linda point out that Westeros's laws don't ''exactly'' work like English Common Law when it comes to this: there are cited examples of children born out of wedlock who ''were'' legitimized upon the subsequent marriage of their parents, which isn't how English Common Law works. Westeros in some ways puts much more emphasis on legitimacy: the real Middle Ages never branded bastard children with a series of special surnames the way that Westeros uses "Snow" and "Sand". They also acknowledge that the Crown is more powerful than the Faith in Westeros, when it was often the other way around in Medieval Europe: the King on the Iron Throne unquestionably has the power to legitimize bastard children, without input by the Faith, while in Medieval Europe a King had to get special permission from the Church to do so. [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], the Unworthy, famously [[Legitimization|legitimized]] all of his bastard children right before his death - Rhaegar could, plausibly, have just had Jon Snow declared a legitimized bastard (either by his father or waiting until he succeeded him as king) - and this might even be what he did in the novels (without necessarily marrying Lyanna), but the TV series may have shied away from this because Jon's status as a "legitimized bastard" puts into question if he really outranks Daenerys in the line of succession.
**Separately, Elio and Linda pointed out that because "annulment" of a marriage that produced children never happens in Westeros, there is no precedent for it - thus if Rhaegar ''did'' manage to pressure the High Septon into granting him special dispensation for an annulment, while he was at it he could have ''also'' pressured the High Septon into specifically granting the annulment in such a way that it ''did not'' de-legitimize his two older children with Elia. For that matter, Rhaegar could have "annulled" his marriage with Elia and ''then'' had his two children with Elia legitimized by royal decree. The matter is somewhat academic given that both children died before Jon was even born, but it does affect how Rhaegar exactly intended to deal with his Dornish allies: annulling Elia and rendering her children bastards would have made them abandon him or even start a war. At best, if Rhaegar practiced polygamy and took Lyanna as his second wife but declared that Elia's son would still be his heir, the Martells would not be happy given that Lyanna's children could potentially try to undermine Elia's.
***Due to this last point that we have no idea what Rhaegar intended for his two children with Elia, and there are several choices he could have made to annul her while not delegitimizing her children, ''Game of Thrones Wiki'' will not treat Elia's two children as bastards until directly stated otherwise by the TV series.
*As if to complicate the issue ever more, in the fifth novel it is revealed that [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)]] is alive (Varys switched him with another baby, whom [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] killed during the [[Sack of King's Landing]]); he has recently arrived at Westeros with his guardian [[Jon Connington]] and nearly half of the [[Golden Company]], to claim his birthright. Since the marriage of Rhaegar and Elia has never been annulled (it is an invention of the TV show), Aegon has a stronger claim than Daenerys for the Iron Throne, but it is unclear whether he is ahead of Jon too. 
**If the theory R+L=J is confirmed in the novels, and if Jon survives (his plotline in the last published novel ends with the [[Mutiny at Castle Black|mutiny against him]]), it means there are currently three alive Targaryens, who are not fully aware yet of their kinship or even existence: Jon is not aware of his true origin; he and Daenerys believe that Aegon is dead; and it is unknown whether Aegon and Daenerys heard about Jon. It is yet to be seen how the relationship between the three will develop in the upcoming novels, and which of them will have the strongest claim for the Iron Throne.
***In case of an armed conflict between two or all of the aforementioned Targaryens, it is likely that Jon's enemies will claim Rhaegar never married Lyanna, thus he is a bastard; Aegon's enemies will claim he is an impostor (there are fan speculations about that); Daenerys's enemies will claim that she ranks behind Jon or Aegon. Of course, in such case the only applicable law will be "might makes right", rather than any inheritance law or legal argument.
*'''High Septons do not have names'''. As the leader of the [[Faith of the Seven]], each [[High Septon]] gives up their original name, and is referred to as simply "the High Septon". For that matter, it is ''forbidden'' to refer to their original name, even retroactively. This episode claims that Rhaegar's annulment, at the start of [[Robert's Rebellion]], was "High Septon Maynard". There is no septon named "Maynard" in the novels. This "Maynard" will instead be referred to as "[[High Septon (Robert's Rebellion)]]".
*Gilly's mention that this High Septon kept a detailed journal of his entire life, including his bowel movements, actually appears to be a reference to a joke from the novels: when Sam is reading through books in the Castle Black library looking for information, and notes that a book by Septon Jorquen about Lord Commander Orbert Caswell consists of entry after entry of dull reporting about his bowel movements (AFFC, Samwell I).
*When Sam leaves Oldtown and the Citadel, he quotes that he's had enough of "reading about the achievements of better men" - which is how his father Randyll derided the scholarly work of the maesters to Sam in Season 6's "[[Blood of My Blood]]".
*In the books, the full [[Conclave]] has many more [[Archmaester]]s in it than the eight seen at the council meeting in this episode. This was probably just a subcommittee of some kind going over current issues. Their dialogue also namedrops two historical characters from the books:
**[[Jenny of Oldstones]] was a commoner girl who lived half-wild in the forest around the ruins of [[Oldstones]]: despite her lowborn status, Crown Prince [[Duncan Targaryen]] fell in love with Jenny. His father, [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V Targaryen]], was an understanding man but marrying a commoner of such lowborn station (living in the woods) was beneath what even he could tolerate, and he gave his son the ultimatum that if he married her he would forsake all right of inheritance. Duncan happily agreed to these terms and married Jenny, abdicating his right to inheritance, and the throne passed to his younger brother. The Archmaester in the episode says that Jenny claimed descent from the [[Children of the Forest]]; actually, in the novels, she didn't claim this herself, but her friend and companion was an albino [[Woods witch]] who claimed such descent (it's unknown if it was true).
**[[Lodos]] the priest-king was a prophet of the [[Drowned Men]] on the [[Iron Islands]]. After [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] destroyed the ironborn's armies on the mainland at the [[Burning of Harrenhal]], the few survivors retreated back to their home isles. Lodos was crowned by the other priests and tried to rally the ironborn under him. When Aegon finally invaded with his large army and dragons, Lodos stood on the shore and beseeched the [[Drowned God]] to send [[kraken]]s to destroy Aegon's fleet. When they failed to appear, Lodos filled his pockets with heavy stones, and walked into the sea, saying that he had to "take counsel" with the Drowned God. He never returned.
*Sam does not try to convince the Conclave by telling about his own experience beyond the Wall. Perhaps he thought no one would believe that he actually fought the White Walkers, let alone destroyed one of them; in the books and show, few people believe it, not even other members of the Night's Watch.

===On Dragonstone===
*[[Drogon]] approaches [[Jon Snow]] inquisitively and sniffs his hand, even letting Jon touch his nose. In the novels, it is thought that only those of the Targaryen bloodline can successfully bond with [[dragon]]s, and Jon is unknowingly Daenerys's own nephew. Drogon's friendly reaction to him is a major confirmation of his real parentage.
**That Drogon is friendly to him reinforces this even more heavily, as Drogon is the most cantankerous and least friendly to people besides Daenerys herself. Although the differences in the dragons' personalities aren't as fleshed out in the TV series as they are in the books, TV-Drogon is still much less friendly than TV-Rhaegal or TV-Viserion.
**In the books, [[Viserion]] takes a liking to Brown Ben Plumm, the new commander of the [[Second Sons]] (who has not appeared in the TV series). Although the friendliest of the three dragons, Viserion's affinity for Plumm extends to actually landing on his shoulder (when he is still small, like the size he was in Season 2). Both Plumm and Daenerys only half-jokingly agree this is because of his Targaryen heritage, as he claims he is a very distant bastard descendant of [[Elaena Targaryen|a dragon princess]] from over a hundred years ago (Plumm is vague as to her identity, but hints from other materials narrow down who she was).
**In the novels, the Martells also have some Targaryen blood from the first Daenerys Targaryen, who married Maron Martell a century prior. After a failed meeting with Daenerys, Quentyn Martell believes that his ancestry will allow him to at least tame one of Daenerys's dragons. After gaining access to the dragons, Quentyn eventually attempts to tame Viserion, but Rhaegal attacks Quentyn from behind, and bathes him in dragonfire. He dies four days later, covered in burns.
**Incidentally, through intermarriage, [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] also has some Targaryen blood - [[Robert Baratheon]] was actually [[Rhaegar Targaryen]]'s second cousin, as his grandmother was a younger Targaryen princess. Thus Gendry is a cousin of both Daenerys and Jon. Gendry only briefly stops on Dragonstone, however, and doesn't interact with Daenerys just yet. As queen, she does, if she so chooses, have the power to [[Legitimization|legitimize]] him, and potentially resurrect [[House Baratheon]].
*Jon accurately recalls that he saw Gendry's father Robert during the feast at [[Winterfell]] in the Season 1 premiere "[[Winter Is Coming]]", Gendry in turn mentions that he met Jon's father Eddard Stark at his shop, in Season 1's "[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]".
*With continued irony that Gendry unaware of, he says to Jon that "our fathers fought together", referring to [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] and [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] fighting together as allies. The truth of Jon's parentage, however, makes this statement ironic: Robert and [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] "fought together" against each other at the [[Battle of the Trident]], resulting in Robert killing Rhaegar. Gendry's father ''literally killed'' Jon's father.
*Jon lightly mocks Robert by saying that he was a lot heavier (fatter) than Gendry, and Gendry responds by playfully saying Jon is shorter than Eddard, to Jon's chagrin. [[Kit Harington]] is actually 5'8" in height, and thus not relatively tall, while Jon in the books is somewhat tall and lean (though he is just a teenager). Ironically, [[Joe Dempsie]] (Gendry) is taller at 5'10", yet himself felt self-conscious that he was too short to play Gendry - who, as Robert's son, is very tall and muscular in the novels.
*When Jon Snow receives the letter from Winterfell, he is stunned to learn that Bran and Arya are still alive, saying he thought they were both dead. In the books, no one has any idea they are still alive: Arya hasn't been seen since she evaded capture when her father Ned was arrested, while most still think Theon killed Bran and Rickon at Winterfell. In the TV series, Brienne encountered Arya in Season 4, then later informed Sansa that Arya is still alive - and both of them would presumably have then told Jon. Meanwhile, despite the fact that Bran explicitly told [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] not to tell Jon that he's still alive when he went north of the Wall in the Season 3 finale, Sam later told him in Season 4 (even though he kept his promise and never told him in the books). Sam and Jon believe Bran might have gone to Craster's Keep and Jon, concerned for Bran as he has gone north of the Wall, wants to find him. However, when a mission to confront Lord Commander Mormont's mutineers allows Jon to go to Craster's Keep, Jon finds no trace of Bran. It is possible to reconcile that because no one has seen Arya or Bran ''since'' Season 4, perhaps 2 to 3 years, and the last anyone heard, Bran had gone to dangerous lands north of the Wall, Jon may have ''given up hope'' that they were still alive without any new word about them.
*[[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] brought along some contraband as part of his cover story that he's a smuggler, in the event that the Gold Cloaks stopped them: fermented crab, which he claims is an aphrodisiac. This may be a reference to the fact that, as Davos has explained before, his own father was a poor crabber.
*For a smuggler, Davos acts very carelessly: he and Tyrion row to King's Landing in broad daylight; they wear no disguise; they land at a totally exposed beach; finally, Davos does not even bother to hide the boat, despite what Tyrion says. Davos does somewhat explain his lack of a disguise when he meets Gendry, that he hasn't been in King's Landing for decades, and thus none of the gold cloaks would recognize him. Although Davos actually did return to King's Landing in "Blackwater", he never actually entered the city ''itself'': He was blown off his boat in the Wildfyre explosion and washed onto an island.
*Davos comes up with the fake name "Clovis" to call Gendry - this actually isn't a name used by any characters in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels. It is a medieval name, however: [[Wikipedia:Clovis I|Clovis I]] was the first king of the united Franks in the late fifth century, founder of the Merovingian dynasty (the first kings of what would later become France).
*[[Jorah Mormont]] goes through no less than three costume changes during the course of this single episode - unusual for a character who sometimes goes through entire seasons in the same traveling outfit.
*Tyrion gives Jorah a coin for good luck, explaining it is the one coin that [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz|the slaver]] "paid" to ''both'' of them in Season 5's "[[The Gift]]", when he bought them at a slave-auction in [[Meereen]], which would be the only payment either of them would receive for life (cynically trying to avoid Daenerys's ban on slavery).
*In the previous episode, Davos notes that Jon appears to be attracted to Daenerys; while not explicitly denying it, Jon brushes it off, claiming it is not the time for romance. In this episode, Daenerys shows signs of attraction to Jon, as she appears to be holding back tears when he declares he will return North (and on a mission that he may very well not survive). Jon even playfully refers to this, claiming that if he dies, Daenerys will no longer have to deal with the King in the North, and Daenerys responds that she has "grown used to him".
*Before leaving Dragonstone, Jon tells Daenerys, "I wish you good fortune in the wars to come". This exact line was previously uttered by by [[Mance Rayder]] to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] in the Season 5 premiere "[[The Wars To Come]]", and by [[Arthur Dayne]] to Eddard Stark in Season 6's "[[Oathbreaker]]". This also may be a form of grim foreshadowing, given that both Ned and Stannis later suffered brutal deaths.

=== In King's Landing ===
*[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] reveals that she is now pregnant with her fourth child fathered by [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. '''A note to wiki editors:''' pregnancies don't get characters-articles or entries in wiki family trees - the child/children must be born first.
**There are actually some hints as of the fifth and most recent novel that Cersei might be pregnant, but hasn't realized it yet. This book ends with her [[walk of atonement|walk of shame]] (which happened at the end of Season 5 of the TV series, but events could be delayed). A few times in the fourth novel she complains that her washerwomen must have shrunk her dresses, because they don't fit well anymore; during her walk of atonement in the fifth novel, it is revealed she has stretch marks on her belly. The ''assumed'' implication was that she was putting on weight due to her heavy alcoholism by that point, and the stretch marks could be (as Cersei assumed) the result of bearing three children, but she could be pregnant. Moreover, besides Jaime, she was also manipulating men by having sex with cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], the Kettleblack brothers, and possibly even the court fool Moon Boy (for all anyone knows - though that last one was a taunt that Tyrion made up to Jaime). This raises the question that Jaime might not even be the father.
**Curiously, the first hint that Cersei might be pregnant now is that [[Qyburn]] is seen with her in private offering to give her medication for unspecified "symptoms" - and Qyburn did the same thing back in the Season 4 premiere, "[[Two Swords]]". Jaime was in the room and asked what symptoms he could be talking about, and Cersei responded that it wasn't his concern, leaving the question unanswered. Jaime and Cersei hadn't had sex before that, because he only just recently returned to King's Landing after almost two years. The TV writers later confirmed that when [[George R.R. Martin]] realized he wouldn't finish the next book before the TV series outpaced it, he had one big final meeting with the showrunners in which he explained the broad outline of what is going to happen in future novels (some things they changed, and some things even he didn't know yet). The TV writers later confirmed that this meeting was after they had finished filming [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]] (right before it aired) but before they started writing Season 4 - and they were also worried going into Season 5 that they would only get seven seasons instead of the planned eight (which is why storylines began to rush in Season 5). Thus it is ''possible'' that the earlier scene in the Season 4 premiere of Qyburn talking with Cersei about unspecified "symptoms" may be some sort of relic about hinting that Cersei would become pregnant again (though given that Jaime only just arrived, it's possible that it was filmed out of order). The parallels between the two scenes are intriguing, but little more can be definitively said. In the final version, it somewhat seems that Qyburn is talking to Cersei about symptoms from her heavy ''drinking'', which Jaime also comments on in the same scene.
**This is actually Cersei's ''fifth'' pregnancy, but the fourth with Jaime's child. In the TV version, she explained in Season 1 that she had a [[Robert Baratheon's son|black-haired son]] fathered by King Robert, before Joffrey, but he died in the cradle from a fever. In the books, Cersei also had four pregnancies before this - because the one time that Robert got her pregnant, she secretly had an abortion rather than bring a child of his into the world.
**This new pregnancy introduces complications to the prophecy made by [[Maggy]] the [[Woods witch]], in the flashback in the Season 5 premiere "[[The Wars To Come]]", that Cersei would have three golden-haired children, not with Robert. If this new pregnancy isn't an invention of the TV series, it's possible that Maggy's prophecy specifically referred to children ''during'' her marriage to Robert, who is dead now.
**In the books, Maggy the witch also gave a prophecy about the "''valonqar''" who would kill Cersei by strangling her to death, wrapping his hands around her throat. Cersei later finds out that this is the Valyrian word for "little brother", making her fear it refers to Tyrion (though Jaime is also her younger brother by a matter of minutes - but he no longer has two "hands"). This new pregnancy opens up the possibility that the "''valonqar''" is actually the "little brother" to her ''previous'' children, and she may die in childbirth as her own mother did.
**In the novels, the relationship between Cersei and Jaime has turned sour to such extent that each of them contemplates about disposing of the other. Moreover, Lancel's tearful confession makes Jaime realize that Tyrion's last words about Cersei's promiscuity are true, and that she is guilty of all the crimes she is charged with (among them the murders of Robert and the previous High Septon). Jaime severs his relationship with Cersei symbolically by burning her distress message. Thus, even if in the novels Cersei is pregnant and Jaime (who has not returned yet to King's Landing) is informed about it, it may not make any difference to him.
*Cersei has reached a point where she doesn't care what the commoners or nobles think, and not only doesn't care if rumor gets out that she's having sex with her brother, but now openly wants to announce that Jaime is the father of her child - basically living like [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]], who practiced brother-sister [[incest]] for generations. In the novels, they discuss trying to do this, but then say they can't because they're not Targaryens and can't force people to accept their incest using dragons.
**A major issue brought up by Cersei's intention to publicly announce that Jaime is the father of her child is that she just promised a marriage-alliance to [[Euron Greyjoy]] - and wanting to start a "dynasty" with Jaime's child instead might jeopardize that. Both Cersei and Euron don't seem to treat the marriage-alliance proposal honestly, with each of them planning to betray the other as soon as they are no longer useful.
*Cersei mentions again that she intends to take out loans from the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] to hire new [[Mercenary|mercenary armies]] from the [[Free Cities]]. She explained in the preceding episode that [[Qyburn]] has already been negotiating to hire the [[Golden Company]], the best and largest sellsword company in Essos. It's unknown how they would feel, however, about fighting ''dragons''.
**In a similar strain, it is questionable if the Iron Bank would be willing to give her any further loans. Now that the debt has been paid, they no longer have anything further invested in the Iron Throne. This, combined with the knowledge of how poorly Cersei's forces faired against the Dothraki and just one dragon, might mean they may not considering House Lannister a wise investment anymore.
*Cersei's suggestion to Jaime that they should think like their father to defeat Daenerys and actually meet with Daenerys seems to indicate that Cersei may be planning some sort of underhanded tactic, i.e. her own version of the [[Red Wedding]].
*It seems strange that Cersei knew Tyrion was in her grasp - but did not seize the opportunity to capture him. A likely reason was that she was biding her time. As even she admits to Jaime in dialogue that their recent defeat means she's too afraid to openly challenge Daenerys: killing Daenerys's Hand would likely have provoked her into attacking King's Landing. Moreover, Cersei explained that she correctly guessed Tyrion would only have risked returning in order to offer some sort of truce, which she desperately needs to stall for time to come up with a better plan.
**Subtlety like this, agreeing to a truce in order to make a long term plan relying on intrigue like Tywin, is somewhat uncharacteristic of Cersei. In the fourth book (Seasons 5 and 6), Cersei comes up with a series of crude, ill-planned schemes, without any consideration of long-range applications, all of which somehow go wrong. It is beyond her to plot a clever scheme like Tywin would come up with, because, as Jaime commented, she has wits but no judgement and no patience. If she had an opportunity to capture Tyrion in the books, she probably wouldn't miss it even if she could accomplish more by waiting for a better opportunity. It is entirely possible though that Cersei has simply learned her lesson from her experiences with the High Sparrow and realized that she can't use short-term schemes anymore.
**Since Tyrion knows well how his siblings think, it is likely he'll figure that Cersei has some treacherous plan in mind.
*Jaime recalls that he once told Bronn that he'd cut Tyrion in half if he ever saw him again, for murdering their own father (regardless of the context), which he did back in Season 5's "[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]". This is a bit of nuance from the books that is difficult to convey on-screen: in Tyrion's POV narration chapters, he repeatedly remarks aloud that he intends to kill Jaime (though near the end of the fifth novel it is implied he starts changing his mind). Jaime, on the other hand, never comments aloud or thinks about killing Tyrion ''prospectively'' for killing their father; in the beginning of the fourth novel, he only thinks that ''in retrospect'', had he known Tyrion's intention, he would have stopped him from harming their father, by killing him. 
*Cersei repeats a variation on her rant that she will defeat whatever enemy she encounters, which she gave in "[[Dragonstone (episode)]]".
*Cersei reminds Jaime that their father Tywin always said that "The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep" - Tywin actually said this to Jaime during his first scene in the TV series, back in Season 1's "[[You Win or You Die]]" in the Lannister army camp.
*Jaime says "If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen? Which one would Margaery been better able to control?" Indeed, in the novels this is the Tyrells' motive to kill Joffrey; Littlefinger explains this to Sansa in ''A Storm of Swords''.
**In the novels, Jaime has no idea who killed Joffrey, and he does not really care (because Joffrey meant nothing to him, and he thinks that Joffrey deserved to die). He hardly makes any inquiries about the murder; he decides to leave the murder mystery unsolved, and make sure no harm happens to Tommen too.
**Cersei, on the other hand, figures out in the novels that the Tyrells are responsible. Annoyed at Margaery's growing influence over Tommen, Cersei suddenly realizes the Tyrells had a strong motive to kill Joffrey: he was too stubborn to be influenced, in sharp contrast to his sweet gentle brother, so the Tyrells had him replaced with Tommen, whom Margaery could easily control as a puppet king. Cersei's additional conclusions, however, are entirely wrong: she believes that Tyrion - not Littlefinger - was the Tyrells' co-conspirator; that the Tyrells helped him escape from prison by bribing the gaolers (that explains, in Cersei's mind, the Tyrell coin which Qyburn found in one of the gaolers' cell); that Tyrion and Sansa are hiding in Highgarden; and maybe the Tyrells were involved in Tywin's murder too. Those conclusions, combined with Cersei's paranoid delusions, drive her to execute her scheme against Margaery, which eventually backfires at her.
*[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] recalls that the last time he was in King's Landing, he had just killed his father with a crossbow (the Season 4 finale, "[[The Children]]"), at which [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] remarks that the last time ''he'' was at the city, Tyrion killed ''his son'' with [[wildfire]] (referring to [[Matthos Seaworth]], in Season 2's episode "[[Blackwater]]").
*[[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] returns in this episode, after being absent since the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]] finale "[[Mhysa]]".
**In the Inside the Episode video, the showrunners state that after he left the storyline at the end of Season 3, it was never a question to them of ''whether'' he would return, but ''when'' he would return. For a few other characters such as [[Yara Greyjoy]] or [[Edmure Tully]], the producers would openly tell the actors that they weren't sure if they would reappear on the show two or three years later because their current storyline ended, and they couldn't guarantee that their future subplots from the novels would reappear. Apparently, Gendry did important enough things in their outlines for future seasons that they always knew he'd have to come back eventually.
**In a post-episode interview, [[Joe Dempsie]] confirmed that his character Gendry cut his hair very short to try to hide his appearance (because he looks so much like a young Robert Baratheon, who wore his hair long, as Gendry did in earlier seasons). Jaime did the same thing in the novels when he was heading to King's Landing with Brienne, in case they ran into soldiers trying to claim the reward on him - though this actually didn't work, and he got recognized anyway. It may have been a needless precaution for Gendry, because as he said, ultimately the Lannisters didn't even look for him in the capital itself.
**Davos's line about wondering if Gendry was "still rowing" is of course a reference to the widespread internet meme joke when fans asked where Gendry was during the past 3 seasons - the response being that he's "still rowing", after last being seen sent away in a rowing boat. The joke was so popular that much of the cast ''including'' [[Joe Dempsie]] (Gendry) have repeated it over their social media at one point or another.
**Gendry wields a war hammer in combat - an auspicious trait because his father Robert, who he never met, ''also'' famously wielded a war hammer in combat (he actually killed Rhaegar Targaryen with a mighty blow from his hammer that caved in his breastplate).
**[[File:705 Gendry Warhammer.png|thumb|[[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] decorated his war hammer with a ''gold'' stag on a ''black'' background.]]Notice that color scheme that Gendry uses to decorate his war hammer: not just a stag sigil for [[House Baratheon]], but a ''gold'' stag on a ''black'' hammer. This is the reverse of the normal Baratheon heraldry, a ''black'' stag on ''gold''. [[Bastard]]s in Westeros are forbidden to use their parents' [[heraldry]] if they have not been legitimized, so a frequent custom is for bastards to reverse the colors of their parent's heraldry (which is permissible). The TV show hasn't directly established that the same is true in the TV continuity, but this seems to be a nod at the custom. This custom was also seen with Jon Snow, when Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] called him "The White Wolf" in the Season 6 finale.
*Gendry didn't leave the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] in the novels, but stayed with them after Arya left. The TV show condensed Gendry with another one of Robert's bastards (Edric Storm), whom [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] brought to Dragonstone and then considered sacrificing in a blood ritual conducted by [[Melisandre]]. Instead this was given to Gendry in Season 3. Thus he never went to Dragonstone, was never saved by Davos (who saves Edric), and didn't have reason to be angry at the Brotherhood for "selling" him to Melisandre, as happened in "[[The Climb]]" (though they didn't know she intended to kill him).
**Thus, in the book version, after Arya left, Gendry continued to work as a blacksmith for the Brotherhood, operating in or around the [[Inn at the Crossroads]]. He later encountered [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] in the fourth novel, as she searched for Sansa, and saved her from [[Biter]], a member of the Brave Companions (the sellswords who cut off Jaime's hands, condensed in the TV series). Thus he hasn't had much of a major role since the third novel... yet.
**The TV version explains that Gendry hid from the Lannisters by going right back where he started, to the Street of Steel in [[King's Landing]] (the blacksmiths' quarter) - Davos's reasoning was that hiding right under Cersei's nose would be the last place she'd look. Actually, such a plan is not without precedent in the novels: in the books, [[Varys]] simply disappears after Tyrion kills Tywin at the end of the third novel, and only reappears at the end of the fifth novel to kill [[Pycelle]] and [[Kevan Lannister]] within their chambers in the [[Red Keep]]. It is unknown if he left for the Free Cities but then returned, but it is entirely possible that he ''never left'' King's Landing in that entire time, but was just hiding in the secret tunnel network (or using disguises). [[Aegon II Targaryen]] performed a similar trick during the [[Dance of the Dragons]], hiding on Dragonstone island itself after [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] seized King's Landing - because Dragonstone was Rhaenyra's own home base, and the humble fishing villages on her own island were the last place she would look.
*A few notes on the geography of [[King's Landing]], as internal maps have been provided in the published books: Davos says that he's going to check for Gendry in [[Flea Bottom]], the slum district where they both grew up (and which is a good place for people to hide that don't want to be found) - though Davos later notes in dialogue that he didn't find him where he started looking (Flea Bottom), but back at the Street of Steel. Flea Bottom is at the bottom of Rhaenys's Hill, below the [[Dragonpit]] which is atop the hill, on the northeast side of the city. The Street of Steel is on the back side of Visenya's Hill, on the opposite southwestside of the city, near the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] on top (or now, that is, near the ruins of the Great Sept). The Red Keep is in the southeast corner of the city, on Aegon's Hill.
**The Street of Steel actually appeared in Season 1, in Gendry's own first scene, when Eddard Stark first found him working at [[Tobho Mott]]'s smithy. Thus Gendry's reintroduction mirrors his first appearance.
*Tyrion is easily spotted by the [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]] on patrol - though other characters do remark that there's a good chance he will be spotted, he says he must risk it because only he can get through to Jaime in person. In the novels, when Tyrion goes on the run in the Free Cities (corresponding to Season 5), others suggest that he try to hide his identity - this seems rather futile, so he sarcastically quips that he'll just claim he's one of the ''other'' [[dwarf]]s who have a horrific and distinctive facial injury.
*When trying to pay off the two Gold Cloaks, Davos asks if the customary bribe is still 5 [[Money|gold dragon]] coins, and they scoff that he must not have been to the city in a while, because they consider a good bribe to be 15 Gold Dragons (for each of them, a total of 30). Davos was last an active smuggler in the region over 20 years ago, at the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]] - this brings up that considerable price inflation has occurred since the [[War of the Five Kings]] broke out. Davos thought 5 Gold Dragons was a good-sized bribe in pre-war times: for comparison, before the war broke out, a ''single'' Gold Dragon was worth roughly a knight's [[horse]], and thus a considerable amount of money.
*Cersei apparently found out that Tyrion had contacted Bronn to arrange a meeting using Qyburn's network of "[[little birds]]" - or any of the other numerous spies in the city.
**Cersei's declaration that "nothing happens in this city without me knowing it" is ironic, given that she didn't know that King Robert's surviving bastard son Gendry was hiding in the city this entire time - though the point of Davos's plan was that Cersei's forces wouldn't even think to look for him in her own capital city (a trick used by several characters in the books).

===At Eastwatch-by-the-Sea===
*In the Inside the Episode video, showrunner [[D.B. Weiss]] admits that the wight-hunt that Jon is going on is an invention of the TV series, an idea "we came up with" which isn't based on events in a future novel.
**For that matter, he says that it's loosely inspired by how [[Alliser Thorne]] was sent to King's Landing with the severed hand of one of the two wights ([[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers|Jafer]]) that tried to kill Lord Commander Mormont, to present it as proof their claims were real, but it rotted away to nothing by the time he was granted an audience. This ''did not happen'' in the TV version - or rather, the setup for it was included in Season 1's "[[Baelor]]", when Jeor Mormont did state in dialogue that he had sent Thorne to King's Landing with the wight's severed hand to present as evidence to Joffrey, but then there was no follow-up to this in Season 2, and it was never mentioned again in any subsequent season. In the books, Thorne indeed arrived at King's Landing, but because he had alienated Tyrion while he was at Castle Black, Tyrion made him many days before finally giving him an audience. When he was finally received by Tyrion, the wight-hand had rotted away (from its constant thrashing) to the point that it couldn't move anymore and wasn't suitable proof. Tyrion teased Thorne as if he was talking nonsense, and sent him away - though the book makes a point that Tyrion thought it might be true, and if the messenger had not been Thorne, Tyrion might have treated him differently. The video heavily edits Weiss's comments, however, so he might have just been more broadly referring to the idea from the books of taking part of a wight south as evidence of their existence.
**Jon ''didn't really need'' to go on an epic wight-hunt in the books: as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, in the fifth novel, he already started ordering his men to try to capture wight stragglers, and specifically, to leave two corpses they found beyond the Wall in the ice cells atop it (which are impossible to climb out of with a ladder), to wait and see if they will reanimate. When questioned about this, Jon explicitly says that they know almost nothing about the wights, and he wants to capture a few so they can try to study them. Bowen Marsh and others, who have already grown displeased at Jon's conduct as the Lord Commander (especially about accepting the wildlings to the Watch), disapprove of the idea. The corpses, however, remain still, maybe because there are no Others nearby to reanimate them.
*It is unclear where the rest of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] went. There are at least a hundred or so men in the partisan group, but only [[Beric Dondarrion]], [[Thoros]] of Myr, and [[Sandor Clegane]] are present at Eastwatch. All of these other background members were even seen in the Season 7 premiere "[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]", traveling as a group with these three lead members. [[Tormund]] says he imprisoned these men when he found them snooping around near the Wall, so it's ''possible'' that the others simply retreated or that Beric, Sandor, and Thoros were scouting ahead of the main party - or, the TV writers might just want to wrap up the Brotherhood storyline. Another possibility is that they are being held "in reserve" until the plot has need of them again (it seems they wanted to take only a small, quick scouting party beyond the Wall - otherwise Tormund would have taken more of his wildling garrison with them).
**In the novels, the Brotherhood has greatly fallen low ever since Beric died and Lady Stoneheart (the reanimated [[Catelyn Stark]]) took over, and now it is just like any outlaw gang. It does not attempt to go to the Wall at all (and there is no wight hunt in the books), but instead stays in the south hunting down and killing members of House Frey, and also innocent people whose only "crime" is that they have some connection to the Lannisters.
*Several unexpected reunions occur when Jon Snow's group meets the Brotherhood:
**Jon mentions that he saw the Hound at Winterfell - he was there in the Season 1 premiere "[[Winter Is Coming]]" for the feast at Winterfell, as part of King [[Robert Baratheon]]'s entourage (and he also recalled to Gendry how he saw Robert at the feast, earlier in the episode).
**Thoros recognizes [[Jorah Mormont]]. As mentioned in several prior TV seasons, they fought side by side at the [[Siege of Pyke]] during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
**Gendry is displeased to see the Brotherhood, after they sold him to [[Melisandre]] in Season 3 (though they didn't know she would try to kill him). Jon is surprised at the mention of the red priestess, who he later met as well.
**Tormund is surprised to learn that Jorah is [[Jeor Mormont]]'s son, who was the leader of the Night's Watch fighting the wildlings for many years.
*[[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] debuts as an on-screen location in this episode; it has been mentioned in dialogue since Season 1 - very prominently when Tyrion had [[Janos Slynt]] exiled to the Wall in Season 2, and said he was sending him on a ship bound for "Eastwatch-by-the-Sea". No specific scenes have been set there in the current novels, though characters who have been there describe it in passing. It ''seems'' to have some kind of docks in the books, though it's possible that larger ships are simply anchored off-shore and use row-boats to get to the coast, as Jon does in this episode. The commander of Eastwatch at the start of the novels is [[Cotter Pyke]], who was mentioned in dialogue in Season 1, though he might not be alive by this point in the TV continuity.
**Eastwatch-by-the-Sea is the second manned castle on the Wall to appear on-screen in the TV series - the third castle overall, if one counts the abandoned ruins of the [[Nightfort]] which Bran Stark and Samwell Tarly passed through in Season 3.
*[[Tormund]] asks, "How many queens are there now?", and is told there are two: [[Cersei Lannister]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. The lords gathered in [[Winterfell]], however, are starting to openly question in council if they should perhaps name [[Sansa Stark]] the new "Queen in the North". It's possible that Tormund's line is supposed to be a hint that the number of queens south of the Wall is about to increase yet again, to three.
**At the end of her last chapters in the current books, Littlefinger remarks to Sansa that "What little peace and order the five kings left us will not long survive the three queens, I fear." Then Sansa's POV narration continues: ''"Three queens?" Sansa did not understand. Nor did Petyr choose to explain.'' The first two queens are apparently Cersei and Daenerys (Sansa assumed the second was [[Margaery Tyrell]]), but it's possible that Littlefinger intends for Sansa ''herself'' to be the third queen, capturing the North with the Vale's army (and hopefully remaining as his puppet). There has been fan speculation that Littlefinger's cryptic closing remarks to Sansa were a foreshadowing that the conflict which began as the "[[War of the Five Kings]]" will grow into a second conflict dubbed the "War of the Three Queens" as a parallel to the first. The truth of the matter will have to wait until the next novel is released. As it is, within the continuity of the TV series, the War of the Five Kings has indeed transitioned into a new conflict between Daenerys and Cersei, which was later referred to on-screen as the "[[Last War]]."
