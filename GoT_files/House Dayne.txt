{{Quote|As a boy, even I dreamed sometimes of being not a Stark of Winterfell, but a Dayne of Starfall. Legend has it that the Dornish founder of House Dayne followed a falling star to where it hit the ground. And there, he raised his castle. A fantastic story, I know, but House Dayne has a relic to prove it. Dawn. The most famous sword in Westeros.|[[Eddard Stark]]|House Dayne (short)}}
'''House Dayne'''{{Ref|H&L613}} of [[Starfall]] is a [[noble house]] from [[Dorne]] and a vassal to [[House Martell]]. They were once minor kings, styling themselves as [[King of the Torrentine|Kings of the Torrentine]].

Their ancestral weapon is [[Dawn]], a blade forged from the metal of a fallen star. The Dayne [[Knighthood|knight]] that bears the sword is granted the title of "the [[Sword of the Morning]]".

House Dayne's sigil consists of a black sword within a falling star on a blue field.

== History ==
House Dayne can trace its roots back to the [[Dawn Age]]. [[Starfall]] is built on an island at the mouth of the Torrentine River, where the first Dayne is said to have tracked a falling star and found a magical stone.<ref>''The World of Ice & Fire'', Kingdoms of the First Men.</ref> In present-day Westeros, House Dayne is best known for their ancestral sword, Dawn, and the "Sword of the Morning" who wields it.

Although considered "stony" [[Dornishmen]], who possess fairer coloring than the rest of the Dornish population, the Daynes' appearance is different even from this exclusive group; many have blue or purple eyes, and hair color ranges from dark to pale blond.

House Dayne fought several battles with houses from the [[Reach]]. King [[Vorian Dayne]] was defeated by [[House Martell]] in [[Nymeria's War]], though because of his honor, Nymeria sent him to the [[Wall]] with golden fetters and married his heir, [[Davos Dayne]]. Since then, House Dayne has been fiercely loyal to House Martell. They assisted the Martells in unifying [[Dorne]] and subduing other Dornish houses. During [[Aegon's Conquest]], Lord [[Joffrey Dayne]] led an army to [[Oldtown]].<ref>"[[House Dayne (short)|House Dayne]]"</ref>

The Martells and their vassals rallied behind the Targaryens in [[Robert's Rebellion]]. The legendary knight [[Arthur Dayne]] was killed in the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy]], one of the last battles in the war. Although killing or disarming all of his opponents with ease, he was stabbed in the back by [[Howland Reed]], whom he thought he had mortally wounded early in the fight, and subsequently killed by [[Eddard Stark]].<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref> Dawn was subsequently returned to Starfall by Eddard.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, members of House Dayne are Stony [[Dornishmen]], whose characteristics mostly resemble the rest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] in look, customs, and traditions (being composed of the same [[First Men]]/[[Andals|Andal]] mixture). Unlike the rest of the more [[Rhoynar|Rhoynish]]-looking Dornishmen, however, they have pale skin with hair ranging from dark brown to pale blond and they often have violet eyes, though according to [[George R.R. Martin]] they are not of [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] descent.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20001210110800/http://www.eventhorizon.com:80/sfzine/chats/transcripts/031899.html/ So Spake Martin, March 18, 1999]</ref>

In the novels, the House sigil is different than in the show: it depicts a silver sword and a falling star crossed sideways on a violet-colored background.
