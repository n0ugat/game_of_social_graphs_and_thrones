'''Floris Baratheon''' is a noblewoman from [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Floris is a daughter of Lord [[Borros Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]]. She has three sisters: [[Cassandra Baratheon|Cassandra]], [[Maris Baratheon|Maris]], and [[Ellyn Baratheon|Ellyn]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Floris is present in the great hall of Storm's End when [[Lucerys Velaryon]] arrives to obligate Borros to support his mother [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] in the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. Borros feels insulted that Luke has come without an offer, in contrast to the [[Greens]] negotiating a betrothal between Floris and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]].{{Ref|HOTD110}} Luke fails to sway Borros and the betrothal is finalized.{{Guideref|Floris Baratheon}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Floris is mentioned by [[Otto Hightower|Otto]] during a session of the [[Green Council]], as her marriage pact to [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] brings the [[Stormlands]] to the cause of the [[Greens]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

==Family==

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Floris and her sisters Cassandra, Maris, and Ellyn were known as the "Four Storms". Their mother was Lady Elenda of [[House Caron]]. Floris was the prettiest of the Baratheon sisters. The book doesn't actually specify which of the Baratheon girls Aemond agreed to a betrothal with, except that it wasn't Maris (because she subsequently insulted Aemond for not picking her). Borros let Aemond choose for himself: Cassandra was eldest (and thus might produce the Baratheon heir if Borros had no future sons), Maris was the cleverest, and Floris was the "comely" one.
