Princess '''Rhaena Targaryen''' was a Princess of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty and a sister of [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]].

==Biography==
Rhaena Targaryen was a Princess of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] dynasty and a sister of [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]], who imprisoned her along their sisters [[Daena Targaryen|Daena]] and [[Elaena Targaryen|Elaena]] at the [[Maidenvault]] to prevent carnal temptations.{{Ref|H&L309}}

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Rhaena was the second daughter of King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon III]]. She's described as a feminine beauty, soft and sweet, more rounded than her two sisters. She loved lace and gold trim and often embroidered depictions of faith on her clothing. She had silver-gold hair, more gold than silver. Unlike Daena and Elaena, she never chaffed at their confinement. She was heavily influenced by her brother, eventually becoming a [[septa]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]].

Aegon III's daughter Rhaena was actually at least the third member of House Targaryen to bear that name, because names often repeat in dynasties. The other two Rhaenas have not yet been introduced into the TV continuity. The first Rhaena was a sister of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]], who was forced to marry her half-uncle [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] after he killed her current husband (her brother Aegon). The second Rhaena was Aegon III's own half-sister, called "Rhaena of Pentos". They both shared the same father, Daemon Targaryen, but had different mothers.
