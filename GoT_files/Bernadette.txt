{{Quote|Forgive me, Your Grace. You told me to come at once if there was anything important.|Bernadette to [[Cersei Lannister]]|Two Swords}}
'''Bernadette'''<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2407387/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1</ref> is a handmaiden of [[House Lannister]] who served in the [[Red Keep]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[File:Shae threatens.jpg|thumb|Shae holds a knife to Bernadette's throat.]]
She is a handmaiden to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. She finds Sansa and [[Shae]] trying to turn over her mattress to conceal Sansa's first [[flowering]]. She attempts to inform [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], but Shae threatens her with a knife to keep quiet. Nevertheless, the Queen is informed by the [[Sandor Clegane|Hound]].{{Ref|GOT207}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Bernadette continues to be assigned to Sansa. She announces [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] when he calls on Sansa to "propose" to her.{{Ref|GOT306}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Bernadette continues to spy on Tyrion for Cersei and discovers that his real secret lover is actually Shae. She then enters Cersei's chambers, while [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is present, to inform her of something "important".{{Ref|GOT401}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:601 Cersei and Handmaiden.png|thumb|Bernadette informs Cersei about Myrcella's arrival.]]
After Sansa's departure from King's Landing, Bernadette now seems to be serving Cersei herself. She notifies Cersei that a ship has arrived from Dorne.{{Ref|GOT601}} Later, at the day of Cersei's trial by the Faith, she helps Cersei into her clothes, moments before the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|Destruction of the Great Sept]].{{Ref|GOT610}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[File:Bernadette-game-of-thrones.jpg|thumb|182x182px|Bernadette informs Cersei of Tycho's arrival.]]
Following Cersei's coronation, Bernadette begins to wear dark robes and cut her hair short as the court fashion for women is now mimicking Cersei's appearance. One morning, Bernadette goes to the Queen's room to inform her that [[Tycho Nestoris]] is waiting for her. While there, Bernadette spots an undressed [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] in the bed of his sister, as Cersei decides that they would no longer hide their [[incest]]uous love affair. Although clearly surprised, Bernadette is wise enough not to comment and to simply deal with Cersei's instructions right away.{{Ref|GOT703}}

==Behind the scenes==
There is no character named "Bernadette" in the novels, and it doesn't seem to match their fantasy world. The character is never actually called that aloud and the name is apparently purely from the filming credits. This name was probably given after [[Bernadette Caulfield]], one of the major producers on the TV series.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, both Sansa and Tyrion are aware that all of Sansa's maids are spies for Cersei. Thus Sansa is careful not to reveal her true feelings to any of them, and Tyrion takes precautions when he meets Shae.

When Tyrion hears servants joke about him that he still has not had sex with Sansa, he figures that Sansa's maids are the ones who spread the gossip. Tyrion complains to [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] about Sansa's maids being Cersei's spies; Tywin nonchalantly answers that if Tyrion doesn't like his wife's servants, he can dismiss them and hire new ones.{{Bookref|ASOS|32}} Tyrion does so, hiring [[Shae]] (who unlike in the series, is utterly indifferent to Sansa) and a trustworthy woman named Brella, whom Varys recommended.{{Bookref|ASOS|58}} Sansa feels more comfortable around them, but is still careful.{{Bookref|ASOS|59}}
