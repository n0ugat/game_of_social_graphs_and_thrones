==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Tywin Lannister]] is in possession of a copy of the book. During his occupation of [[Harrenhal]] he keeps it in his war council chamber. When due to Ser [[Amory Lorch]]'s nigh-illiteracy a letter detailing Western infantry movements is sent to Lord [[Marlyn Dormand]], a vassal of [[House Stark]], instead of Lord [[Damon Marbrand]], a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] vassal, Lord Tywin orders his [[cupbearer]], [[Arya Stark]], to fetch the book. Arya finds it before he tells her which one is it. Tywin then uses the book to remind Ser Amory that the Dormands are Stark vassals.{{Ref|GOT206}}

Torrhen [[Knighthood|knighted]] him on the spot and granted him a small tract of land south of Winterfell. Ser Artys raised the keep of [[Dormand Hall]], which left{{Sic|which he left}} to his son [[Torrhen Dormand|Torrhen]] -- so named for his benevolent liege lord. it was Torrhen that was granted a [[lordship]] some years later.
