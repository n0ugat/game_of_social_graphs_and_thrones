==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
While waiting outside the [[Twins]], [[Robb Stark]] has [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] shoot down any [[raven]]s sent out to prevent Lord Walder from alerting [[House Lannister]] of his army's movements. One raven turns out to be carrying a birthday message to Walda, though Theon speculates it may be a coded message with some other significance.{{Ref|GOT109}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, many members of [[House Frey]] name their daughters Walda in an attempt to please Lord Walder, a custom which annoys him. However, there is no mention of any grandniece of Lord Walder.
