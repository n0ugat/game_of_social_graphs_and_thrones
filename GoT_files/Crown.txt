'''Crowns'''{{Ref|GOT101}} are worn as a symbol of royal or elevated office, especially by [[king]]s. It is customary for kings in [[Westeros]] to wear a crown, though not all kings have. Monarchs may either use crowns inherited from their predecessors, to indicate continuity and right to rule, or for various reasons fashion new crowns for themselves.

Rebels and pretenders sometimes fashion crowns for themselves during their rebellion to indicate their royal status, such as [[Renly Baratheon]], though some have chosen not to, such as [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Robb Stark]].

==Crowns of the Targaryen dynasty==

==Crowns of the Baratheon dynasty==
===Crown of Robert I===
[[File:Robert I's crown.png|thumb|The crown of Robert I]]
Upon taking the throne, Robert Baratheon fashioned a new royal crown. Aerys II Targaryen's crown had prominently incorporated dragon imagery, and Robert's crown similarly incorporated imagery based on his house sigil. Fashioned out of gold, Robert's crown was large and robust, and incorporated amber gemstones as well as very prominent stag-based imagery, appearing to almost have been made out of antlers.

====Royal bearers====
*[[Robert Baratheon|Robert I Baratheon]]{{Ref|GOT101}}

===First crown of Joffrey I===
[[File:Joffrey I's first crown.png|thumb|The first crown of Joffrey I]]
Upon Joffrey Baratheon's rise to the throne, he had a new crown fashioned. Joffrey's crown is significantly smaller and less robust than that of his supposed father Robert, but is stylistically similar and incorporates much of the same imagery. It retains the golden color, the amber gemstones, and the antler imagery, a reference to the sigil of [[House Baratheon]]. After Joffrey's death, his brother Tommen continued to use this first crown, rather than Joffrey's briefly used second crown.

===Second crown of Joffrey I===
[[File:Joffrey I's second crown.png|thumb|The second crown of Joffrey I]]
For [[Purple Wedding|his royal wedding]] to [[Margaery Tyrell]], Joffrey had a second crown made, which was only ever used during this event (his successor Tommen using Joffrey's first crown throughout his reign). Joffrey's briefly worn second crown is overall similar to his first crown, with the antler-based spikes arranged in a similar fashion, but the crown is slightly bigger and there are no gemstones in it. Also added, to symbolize his marriage union to Margaery, are silver roses (the rose being the sigil of [[House Tyrell]]) intertwined with the antlers.

==Crowns of the Lannister dynasty==
===Crown of Cersei I===
[[File:Cersei I's crown.png|thumb|The crown of Cersei I]]
Upon her rise to the throne, Cersei Lannister chose to fashion a new crown. Her crown was noticeably smaller than those of her four direct predecessors, being a small silver circlet of intertwined threads that come together at the front, creating a motif resembling the head of a lion (the sigil of [[House Lannister]]).

*[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei I Lannister]]{{Ref|GOT610}}

==Crowns of consorts==
===Crown of Cersei Lannister===
[[File:Cersei season 1 crown.png|thumb|Cersei Lannister's crown as queen consort]]
During her husband Robert Baratheon's reign, Cersei used a finely detailed crown that prominently incorporated the stag-imagery of House Baratheon, with no apparent details that reference the sigil of her own house. In contrast to the amber gemstones of Robert's crown, Cersei's crown incorporated green gemstones. This crown was not reused upon Cersei becoming Queen regnant, with another new crown being fashioned in its stead.

===Crown of Margaery Tyrell===
[[File:Margaery crown.png|thumb|Margaery Tyrell's crown]]
Margaery Tyrell was crowned with a relatively small, yet finely detailed, crown upon her marriage to Joffrey Baratheon. Though Joffrey died shortly thereafter, Margaery once more assumed the same crown after her marriage to Joffrey's successor, Tommen. Her crown is broadly similar to Joffrey's second crown, incorporating antler imagery and roses intertwining with the antlers, but also incorporates even more prominent roses, the sigil of her house.

==Crowns of pretenders==
===Crown of Renly Baratheon===
[[File:Renly's crown.png|thumb|Renly Baratheon's crown]]
After being crowned at [[Highgarden]] in opposition to Joffrey Baratheon, his supposed nephew, Renly Baratheon used a relatively simple, and notably asymmetrical, golden crown. As with the crown of his brother Robert, Renly's crown incorporated very apparent stag-imagery, most of the crown being composed of golden antlers.

==Other crowns==
===Crown of Daemon Targaryen===
[[File:Daemon Crown.png|thumb|Daemon Targaryen's crown]]
After victory in the first phase of the [[War for the Stepstones]] in 115 AC,{{Dateref|Second of His Name}} the soldiers on the side of [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[House Velaryon]] proclaimed Daemon as the "[[King of the Narrow Sea]]". Daemon was crowned using a crown made with bone decorated with metal details. He retained his title and crown until he in 116 AC{{Dateref|King of the Narrow Sea}} gave up both the title and the crown to his brother, [[Viserys I Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

===Crown of Sansa Stark===
[[File:Sansa crown.png|thumb|Sansa Stark's crown]]
After at last securing the independence of the [[North]], Sansa Stark, the new [[King in the North|Queen in the North]] had herself crowned with a silver circlet that overtly incorporates her house heraldry twice, using the wolf's head of House Stark twice in the front.

===Driftwood Crown of Euron Greyjoy===
[[File:Euron crown (crop).png|thumb|Euron Greyjoy's Driftwood Crown]]
Though his brother and predecessor, [[Balon Greyjoy]], had not used a crown, Euron Greyjoy had a Driftwood Crown, reminiscent of the Driftwood Crowns of the ancient kings of the Iron Islands, fashioned for himself. The term "Driftwood Crown" is literal, with the crown being very simple and looking like an ordinary piece of driftwood.

====Bearers====
*[[Euron Greyjoy]]{{Ref|GOT605}}

===Falcon Crown===
[[File:King of the Mountain and the Vale.png|thumb|The Falcon Crown]]

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are notable differences in crowns that also appear in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and ''[[House of the Dragon]]''.

*The crown of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon I]] is a circlet, but is otherwise the same, being made of [[Valyrian steel]] and having sockets for square-cut rubies.
*The crown of [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys I]] is inlaid with jade and pearl with the faces of the [[Seven]]. In ''[[Histories & Lore]]'', it is depicted as having square-cut rubies of varying sizes.
*The crown of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]] is a simple yellow gold band with seven gemstones of different colors representing the [[Seven Kingdoms]].
*The crown of [[Renly Baratheon]] is highly ornate, with golden roses and antlers and a jade stag's head.
*[[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]] does not have his own unique crown, and instead wears the crown of [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]].
*[[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] does not wear a second crown for his wedding to [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]].

There are also instances of characters wearing crowns that do not appear in TV adaptations at all:
*The [[High Septon]] wears a tall and extravagant crystal crown. After it goes missing in the [[riots in King's Landing]], [[Tywin Lannister]] gives the [[High Septon (Tommen)|new High Septon]] an even more impressive crown. The [[High Sparrow]] later sells it.
*[[Alicent Hightower]] wore a crown that she gave to her daughter [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] during the coronation of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], but no description is made of it.
*[[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse Florent]] wear twin red gold crowns with points that resemble flames.
*[[Daenerys Targaryen]] is gifted a crown by the Tourmaline Brotherhood of [[Qarth]], specially made for her: it is in the shape of a three-headed [[dragon]] with heads of jade, ivory, and onyx representing [[Rhaegal]], [[Viserion]], and [[Drogon]].
**The so-called "Crown of Meereen" is depicted in the ''A Game of Thrones'' collectible card game by Fantasy Flight Games. It is an ornate golden circlet with a small circular ruby in the middle, and a gold mitre covered in square-cut rubies. It does not appear in the books, however.
*[[Robb Stark]] wears a crown that strongly resembles the Crown of Winter: a bronze circlet surmounted by nine black iron spikes shaped like longswords. After his death,  Ryman Frey (Lord Frey's grandson and heir) gives it to a whore; Ryman is killed by the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], and the crown is currently worn by Lady Stoneheart (the reanimated [[Catelyn Stark]]).
*Jeyne Westerling ([[Talisa Maegyr]]'s book counterpart) also wears a crown.
*[[Balon Greyjoy]] is not seen wearing a driftwood crown, but he is said to have donned the "ancient crown of salt and rock."
*After [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] [[Capture of Winterfell|captures Winterfell]], he begins to wear a misshapen and ugly iron crown with chunks of black diamond and gold nuggets.
*Asha Greyjoy ([[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]]) wears a makeshift crown at the [[kingsmoot on Old Wyk]].
*[[Hizdahr zo Loraq]] wears a gold crown after he marries Daenerys.
*[[Euron Greyjoy]] eventually dispenses with the driftwood crown and dons a new one as [[King of the Iron Islands|King of the Iron Islands,]] an iron circlet with shark's teeth for points.
