'''Karhold'''{{Ref|GOT305}} is the seat of [[House Karstark]], a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. It is located in the far east of the [[North]], south of the [[Bay of Seals]] and inland from the coast of the [[Shivering Sea]].

The castle was founded by [[Karlon Stark]], a younger son of the then-[[King in the North]] after he was rewarded with lands by his father for putting down a rebellion by [[House Bolton]] of the [[Dreadfort]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Karhold's location and history are the same. The castle was originally called "Karl's Hold."
