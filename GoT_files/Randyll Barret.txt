{{Quote|Commander on the floor!|Randyll Barret|The Heirs of the Dragon}}
'''Randyll Barret''' is a captain of the [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|City Watch of King's Landing]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Randyll is a commonborn man with highborn ambitions. He is one of the seven gate captains of the City Watch of King's Landing,<ref name="Script" /> and a lickspittle to [[Daemon Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Randyll is among the gold cloaks rounding up criminals for summary punishment. He points to various criminals, announcing their crimes and personally carrying out the appropriate punishment: he castrates a raper and takes a hand from a thief. He reserves a murderer for Daemon himself, who decapitates him with [[Dark Sister]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

He is later present at the celebratory party the gold cloak officers hold in a brothel on the [[Street of Silk]]. He yells to everyone to quiet down so that Daemon may speak.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Randyll Barret.

Below the Commander of the entire City Watch, there are seven "captains" in all - one for each garrison, posted at each of the city's seven gates.
