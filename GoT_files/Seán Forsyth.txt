'''Seán Forsyth''' is a 3D Sculptor based in Dublin, Ireland. Seán digitally sculpted the "Dorne Dagger", used by [[Ellaria Sand]] to kill Prince [[Doran Martell]] in the [[Water Gardens]] of [[Dorne]]. Working from drawings produced by ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' weapons master [[Tommy Dunne]], Seán used ZBrush to model the dagger before having it 3D printed. This was the first time 3D printing was used to create a prop for the show. Tommy treated the 3D printed piece to produce a finish identical to weathered bronze. The dagger was then attached to a leather strap and worn on the wrist by Ellaria.{{DEFAULTSORT:Forsyth, Seán}}
