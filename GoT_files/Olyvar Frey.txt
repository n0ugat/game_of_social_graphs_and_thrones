{{Quote|You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.|[[Catelyn Stark]] to [[Robb Stark]]|Baelor}}
'''Olyvar Frey''' was one of the many sons of [[Walder Frey]], [[Lord of the Crossing]], and was a [[squire]] to [[King]] [[Robb Stark]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
When [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] negotiates with Lord Frey to gain permission for [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and his army to pass the [[Twins]], one of Walder's demands is for his son Olyvar be made Robb's squire, and eventually be knighted. Robb accepts these terms.{{Ref|GOT109}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Unless he died sometime during the [[War of the Five Kings]], Olyvar is supposedly [[Assassinations at the Twins|murdered]], along with his other male family members, by [[Arya Stark|Arya]], as a payback for the [[Red Wedding]].{{Ref|GOT701}}

==Family==
{{Frey tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Olyvar is the eighteenth son of Lord Walder overall and the fourth born to Lord Walder's sixth wife, Bethany [[House Rosby|Rosby]]. His three older brothers are Perwyn, Benfrey, Willamen, and his younger sister is [[Roslin Tully|Roslin]]. He is two years older than Robb, although he is very immature compared to Robb. He takes part in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood|battle in the Whispering Wood]].

When Robb breaks his marriage pact with [[House Frey]], Olyvar wants to remain with him, but is forced by Ryman ([[Stevron Frey|Stevron]]'s eldest son) to abandon Robb.

Olyvar, alongside his brother Perwyn and nephew Alesander, are kept in the dark about Lord Frey's plan to betray and kill Robb at the [[Red Wedding]]. Apparently it was suspected that the three of them were too loyal to Robb, and would try to warn him or even to defend him when the ambush commenced, so they are sent away from the Twins "on duty". Catelyn and Robb ask about the absence of those three Freys, but receive only evasive answers. Too late, as the massacre begins, Catelyn realizes the significance of their absence.
