After a summer lasting almost ten years, the words of [[House Stark]] have finally become reality once again: winter is here.

In [[King's Landing]], [[Cersei Lannister]] has finally seized the power that she has craved for many years. In one swift move, she has eliminated nearly all of her enemies, rivals, and obstructions; Queen [[Margaery Tyrell]], Lord [[Mace Tyrell]], Ser [[Loras Tyrell]], Cersei's uncle Ser [[Kevan Lannister]], [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]], the [[High Sparrow]], and most of - if not all - members of the [[Faith Militant]] were killed when the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] was [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|destroyed]] using large amounts of [[wildfire]], an event orchestrated by Cersei. She has crowned herself the undisputed Queen of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], with [[Qyburn]] as her [[Hand of the King|Hand]] and the undead [[Knighthood|knight]] Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] at her side. After nearly four decades of serving as the power behind the throne, [[House Lannister]] has finally become the new royal house. However, Cersei is still haunted by the prophecy she was told during her childhood, which claimed that the deaths of her three (future) children would predate her own; [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] are all dead, Tommen having taken his own life shortly after the Sept's destruction. This has made Cersei all the more determined to crush her enemies once and for all, but the number of her enemies has just increased exponentially. Though she now sits on the [[Iron Throne]], she has effectively undone all of [[Tywin Lannister]]'s efforts to ensure that his family stay in power as her actions have undoubtedly earned her the hatred of all of Westeros. Most of the realm is either in open rebellion against the Iron Throne or has fallen out of her allies' control, leaving Cersei effectively as the Queen of King's Landing and the lands owned by the Lannisters. It is the beginning of the end.

In the [[Riverlands]], the last bastion of [[Robb Stark]]'s independent Northern-Riverland kingdom, [[Riverrun]], has fallen to House Lannister and [[House Frey]] in a [[Second siege of Riverrun|siege]] led by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]. Lord [[Edmure Tully]], who had been held hostage by the Freys ever since the [[Red Wedding]], ordered the Tully garrison to stand down for the sake of his [[Roslin Tully|wife]] and [[Edmure Tully's son|child]], whom Jaime had violently threatened if Edmure refused to cooperate. Edmure's uncle, [[Brynden Tully|Brynden "The Blackfish" Tully]], is dead, having chosen to fight to the death rather than surrender. [[Brienne of Tarth]] and her squire, [[Podrick Payne]], had traveled to Riverrun in an attempt to recruit the Blackfish to assist [[Sansa Stark]] in reclaiming [[Winterfell]] from [[House Bolton]]. The attempt failed, and they were only barely able to escape when the castle fell.

Although House Frey has reclaimed Riverrun, Lord [[Walder Frey]] is also dead. [[Arya Stark]], despite nearly being killed by the [[Waif]] and ultimately overcoming the assassin in single combat, has completed her training as a [[Faceless Men|Faceless Man]] in the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Braavos]]. With her original mission clearly back in focus, she has abandoned the Order and returned to Westeros to cross more names off of her list of vengeance, starting with Walder Frey, the last surviving orchestrator of the Red Wedding that claimed the lives of her [[Catelyn Stark|mother]], [[Robb Stark|brother]], and pregnant [[Talisa Stark|sister-in-law]], at the same time butchering Walder's two most prominent sons, [[Lothar Frey]] and [[Walder Rivers]] who also helped carry out the massacre, and leaving the rule of the Riverlands in unknown hands. Also, [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor "The Hound" Clegane]] has survived his brutal fight with Brienne of Tarth and attempted to build a new, humble life, but has been dragged back into conflict by the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], who intend to head north to fight in the war that is coming.

On the [[Iron Islands]], [[King of the Iron Islands|King]] [[Balon Greyjoy]] is dead, having been murdered by his psychopathic younger brother, [[Euron Greyjoy]]. Balon's son, [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], returned to the Iron Islands after helping Sansa Stark escape from [[Ramsay Bolton]] and endorsed his elder sister, [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]], as their father's successor at the subsequent [[kingsmoot on Old Wyk]]. However, Euron has claimed and won the [[Salt Throne]] by promising an alliance with [[Daenerys Targaryen]], which he will use to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. In desperation, and in fear for their lives, Theon and Yara have stolen a hundred ships from the [[Iron Fleet]]. With sailors and soldiers loyal to them, they have traveled to [[Meereen]] and sought out Daenerys's help first. They have managed to secure an alliance between [[House Targaryen]] and [[House Greyjoy]] to help Daenerys retake the Iron Throne and overthrow Euron in return for the Iron Islands' independence. Euron, however, has ordered the construction of an even bigger fleet to begin his own invasions, seek out new alliances and destroy all who may stand in his way of taking the Seven Kingdoms for himself.

Also aiding Daenerys are the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] and the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]], the [[Lord Paramount of the Reach|rulers]] of the [[Reach]]. In [[Dorne]], [[Ellaria Sand]] and the [[Sand Snakes]] have staged a [[Coup in Dorne|coup]]; they have murdered Prince [[Doran Martell]] and his heir, [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]], and taken control of Dorne in retaliation for Doran's refusal to wage war against House Lannister after the brutal [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|death]] of his younger brother Prince [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn]] at the hands of Ser Gregor, who also murdered their sister Princess [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and her two young children, Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]] and Prince [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon]]. With Cersei declaring war against the Sands for their [[Assassination of Myrcella Baratheon|murder]] of her daughter Myrcella, Ellaria has turned to Daenerys and her loyalists to help bring down the Lannisters. Unknown to Ellaria, however, is that [[Tyrion Lannister]], Myrcella's uncle, is now serving as Daenerys's [[Hand of the King|Hand of the Queen]], and will likely demand justice against the Sands for murdering his beloved niece in cold blood. Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]], herself now a target of Cersei as she is now the only surviving Tyrell, has met with Ellaria and the Sand Snakes, a meeting facilitated by [[Varys]]. Although skeptical of their motives (and wary that they essentially [[Kinslaying|murdered their own family]] to seize power), grief-stricken and incensed by the deaths of her son, grandson, and granddaughter, Olenna pledges House Tyrell's forces to Daenerys in the hope of revenge for her slain family, no longer caring about her own survival.

In the [[North]], [[Jon Snow]] and Sansa Stark, aided by Ser [[Davos Seaworth]], [[Tormund|Tormund Giantsbane]], and Lady [[Lyanna Mormont]], have finally defeated Ramsay Bolton and reclaimed Winterfell following a [[Battle of the Bastards|spectacular battle]]. Their victory was also due in large part to the support from the knights of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], the elite soldiers of [[House Arryn]], the [[Defender of the Vale|Defenders of the Vale]], courtesy of Lord [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish]]. Even though House Bolton is now extinct following Ramsay's brutal execution, the future of [[House Stark]] is left in question: with [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] dead, and [[Bran Stark|Bran]] believed dead as well, the Northern and Vale lords have turned to Jon and named him the new [[King in the North]], while Sansa has rejected Littlefinger's proposal to help him take the Iron Throne and become his queen. Given that Littlefinger was instrumental in the outbreak of the [[War of the Five Kings]] (by conspiring with [[Lysa Arryn]] to murder [[Jon Arryn]], pit the Starks and Lannisters against each other, and throw Westeros into complete chaos), and that one of his initial goals was to become the new [[Warden of the North]], Jon's ascension to King in the North is now a major obstacle in his master plan, setting the stage for a looming conflict between Jon and Littlefinger, the latter already having sewn seeds of distrust in Sansa towards Jon. The [[red priest]]ess [[Melisandre]], meanwhile, has been dismissed from Jon's service following the discovery of her role in [[Shireen Baratheon]]'s death, as well as for the burning of countless innocent people as sacrifices to the Lord of Light during her service to [[Stannis Baratheon]], stripping Jon of easily one of his most valuable advisers, and is now heading south to locations unknown.

In the [[Reach]], after navigating various obstacles, [[Samwell Tarly]], [[Gilly]], and [[Sam|her son]] have finally reached the [[Citadel]] in [[Oldtown]], where Sam intends to train as a [[Order of Maesters|maester]] to replace the deceased Maester [[Aemon]] of the Night's Watch, hoping to gain some insight into the [[White Walkers]] and how to defeat them. However, with Sam's theft of [[House Tarly|his family's]] ancestral [[Valyrian steel]] sword, [[Heartsbane]], he has undoubtedly incurred the immense wrath of his father, [[Randyll Tarly]], who will now likely seek retribution, while the absence House Tyrell's armies will have also left the Reach open to coming outside attacks, so Samwell must use the sword in his studies and uncover the secrets behind Valyrian steel for the coming battle against the dead, before all is lost.

Across the [[Narrow Sea]], having at last defeated the slave masters and the [[Sons of the Harpy]], Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has finally set sail for Westeros. She has acquired an army consisting of the [[Unsullied]], the [[Dothraki]], and troops from House Greyjoy, House Tyrell, Dorne, and her three full-grown [[dragon]]s. Tyrion Lannister serves at her side as Hand of the Queen, though at the cost of two of her advisors: Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], whom Daenerys has sent to find a cure for his spreading [[greyscale]] infection, and [[Daario Naharis]], her lover whom Daenerys has ordered to stay behind with the [[Second Sons]] (on Tyrion's advice) so that she may pursue a potential marriage alliance to aid her in her campaign. Unknown to Daenerys, however, there is already [[Jon Snow|somebody]] across the Narrow Sea who may very well have a stronger claim to the Targaryen monarchy than she does, and who may prove to become her most valuable ally or her greatest enemy yet.

[[Beyond the Wall]], [[Bran Stark]] has been training in his power of the [[Sight]] under the tutelage of the [[Brynden Rivers|Three-Eyed Raven]] and has learned some devastating secrets, specifically the origin of the [[White Walkers]] and the true parentage of his believed half-brother, Jon Snow: Jon is the son of [[Lyanna Stark]] and [[Prince of Dragonstone|Prince]] [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], which would make him the nephew and a rival claimant to Daenerys Targaryen for the Iron Throne. Following an attack which claims the lives of the Three-Eyed Raven, [[Hodor]], and seemingly the last of the [[Children of the Forest]], Bran and [[Meera Reed]] have been rescued by Bran's undead uncle, [[Benjen Stark]], and taken back to the Wall. There, Bran must prepare for the arrival of the [[Night King]], who at all costs must be defeated before Westeros can dream of another spring.

==Production==
===Filming===
Producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] confirmed that season seven would be both filmed and released later than past seasons of ''Game of Thrones''. This was mainly due to the desire to accurately depict the winter that now grips Westeros. <ref>http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-season-7-premiere-date-will-later-usual/</ref> As a result, filming took a scheduled pause in December 2016, with a scheduled complete wrap date in February 2017.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/liam-cunningham-sheds-light-season-8-plans/]</ref>

In [[Wikipedia:Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], production began in August 2016. Interior shooting returned to the show's headquarters, the Paint Hall Studios in Belfast as well as Linen Mill Studios in Banbridge. Meanwhile, location shooting has taken place at the following locations so far: the [[Winterfell]] set in [[Wikipedia:Moneyglass|Moneyglass]], the [[Wikipedia:Saintfield|Saintfield]] Estate (for scenes in the Winterfell Godswood)<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-returns-saintfield-estate-season-7/ Watchers on the Wall - Game of Thrones returns to Saintfield estate for season 7]</ref> as well as [[Wikipedia:Ballintoy|Ballintoy]] (previously Pyke), [[Wikipedia:Murlough Bay|Murlough Bay]] (previously The Stormlands),<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-returns-murlough-bay-area-filming/ Watchers on the Wall - Updated!

In [[Wikipedia:Spain|Spain]], filming took place from late October through December at various locations. Production started in the Basque country, including Itzurun Beach in [[Wikipedia:Zumaia|Zumaia]] (as Dragonstone), Muriola Beach in [[Wikipedia:Barrika|Barrika]] (as the shores of Blackwater Bay) and San Juan de [[Wikipedia:Gaztelugatxe|Gaztelugatxe]] in [[Wikipedia:Bermeo|Bermeo]] (as Dragonstone), before moving to Andalusia, where they used the Roman Ruins of [[Wikipedia:Italica|Italica]] in [[Wikipedia:Santiponce|Santiponce]] (as King's Landing), Las Atarazanas (also known as the Royal Dockyards) in [[Wikipedia:Seville|Seville]] (as King's Landing) and [[Wikipedia:Castillo de Almodóvar del Río|Castillo de Almodóvar del Río]] (as Highgarden & Casterly Rock). Meanwhile, filming had also started in the province of Cáceres at Trujillo Castle (as Casterly Rock & King's Landing), before commencing a nearly month long shoot at Las Breñas and Barrueco de Arriba in [[Wikipedia:Malpartida de Cáceres|Malpartida]] (as the Reach).

===Episode count===
Season 7 has a shorter episode count than past seasons: seven instead of ten. The showrunners said they did this because as the story reaches its climax, every episode would be massive in scale. There is a physically finite amount of time that they can film each year, however, and gigantic action scenes on the scale of "[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]" take longer to film than a setup episode of mostly dialogue in interior sets like "[[The Climb]]" or "[[The Gift]]", etc.

Each episode had a physically longer runtime than in prior seasons: the earlier seasons averaged out at around 54 to 56 minutes per episode, but episodes in Season 7 average out at around 63 minutes per episode. As for specific runtimes, the [[Dragonstone (episode)|first]] and [[Stormborn|second episodes]] of the season have a runtime of 59 minutes each,<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/api/schedule/programs?focusIds=799557 Episode 61 HBO Schedule]</ref><ref>[http://www.hbo.com/api/schedule/programs?focusIds=799558 Episode 62 HBO Schedule]</ref> the [[The Queen's Justice|third episode]] has a runtime of 63 minutes,<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/api/schedule/programs?focusIds=799559 Episode 63 HBO Schedule]</ref> the [[The Spoils of War|fourth episode]] has a runtime of 50 minutes, the [[Eastwatch|fifth episode]] has a runtime of 59 minutes, the [[Beyond the Wall (episode)|sixth episode]] has a runtime of 70 minutes, and the [[The Dragon and the Wolf|seventh and final episode]] has a runtime of 80 minutes.<ref>''[http://popculture.com/tv-shows/2017/06/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-length/ Game of Thrones]''[http://popculture.com/tv-shows/2017/06/08/game-of-thrones-season-7-length/ Season 7 Length]</ref>

Taken altogether, therefore, while there are only seven episodes in Season 7, due to their increased individual lengths, there is enough extra runtime to make up for an entire ''eighth'' episode (of the regular length from prior seasons). There was some speculation when the seven episode format was first announced that the showrunners were simply chopping up the normal overall runtime of the season into seven parts because those were the natural "chapter breaks" of the story, but Benioff and Weiss later waved this aside, reiterating that the entire point of filming fewer episodes than in the past was because the scale of each has been drastically increased, straining the limits of how much they can film in a single year. Season 7's total runtime was 7 hours, 18 minutes - compared to the 9 hours, 15 minutes that prior seasons averaged.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-season-7-running-times-revealed-record-length-season-finale-included/]</ref>

Season 7 is different from the previous seasons not only by its number of episodes, but also in several more aspects:
*All the plotlines take place only in the continent of Westeros and its surrounding seas.
*No king is killed off in this season; in the previous six seasons, at least one king was killed per season.
*Each episode contains multiple callbacks and references to previous seasons, at least ten per episode (the final episode alone contains more than twenty), much more than in the previous seasons.
