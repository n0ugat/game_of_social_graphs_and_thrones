'''Milk of the poppy'''{{Ref|GOT107}} is a powerful liquid medicine, consumed orally, that is used as both a painkiller and an anesthetic. Higher doses will induce unconsciousness, so patients can undergo surgery. It is commonly used throughout the [[Seven Kingdoms]] for those who have suffered severe injuries. [[Order of Maesters|Maesters]] make it from crushed poppy flowers; it is called milk due to its white color.

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
When Queen [[Aemma Arryn]] goes into labor and the baby is in breach, Grand Maester [[Mellos]] says that he has given her as much milk of the poppy as he can without risking the life of her unborn child, but she is still in agony. Ultimately Aemma dies when Mellos performs an emergency caesarean-section, though her sickly infant son dies after a few hours anyway.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] is administered milk of the poppy to ease his pains from his prolonged illness. [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] suspects that it is done in order to keep him bedridden in a baffled state of mind, so that [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] and [[Otto Hightower|Otto]] can assume control. Later on, Rhaenyra sees that her father is indeed in unbearable pain without the medicine, though the Hightowers certainly benefited from his incapacitation.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
A servant is about to give the injured [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] milk of the poppy, in compliance with the Grand Maester's instructions, but [[Larys Strong]] stops her. She gives him the bottle and leaves. Larys tells Aegon the potion relieves the pain but dulls the mind; Aegon's mind must be clear to listen to Larys's words, among them that Aemond may seek to kill him.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===

When [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] is mortally wounded, after being [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|gored by a boar while hunting]], he asks to be given something to ease the pain before he dies. [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] then orders [[Pycelle]] to give him milk of the poppy.{{Ref|GOT107}}

Eddard is given milk of the poppy after a Lannister guardsman drives a spear through his leg. [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] later attempts to use this as an excuse for why he would openly denounce [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s legitimacy in court, saying that he had become feverish and the medicine he was taking had affected his behavior.{{Ref|GOT108}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Talisa Stark|Talisa]] comes to [[Robb Stark|Robb]]'s tent to warn him that her stockpiles of medical supplies for his army's wounded, including milk of the poppy, are running low.

After Maester [[Luwin]] is dying from a spear wound under the [[Godswood]], [[Osha]] offers to bring him milk of the poppy, if he would tell her where he stores it. He declines the offer, revealing that his wounds are mortal, and asks instead that she give him the mercy of a quick death.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===

==In the books==
[[File:Poppy-Milk.jpg|thumb|Milky sap produced from cutting an immature opium poppy seedpod.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, "milk of the poppy" is essentially the Westeros version of {{WPS|morphine}}. Maesters make it from crushed poppy flowers, and morphine and other {{WPS|opioid}} drugs are made from poppy plants. Indeed, the books' descriptions strongly suggest that the "poppy" is intended to be the real-world opium poppy (''Papaver somniferum'').  

Milk of the poppy may result in some residual grogginess or withdrawal-like symptoms (like morphine), which some characters would rather avoid by simply enduring the pain. Jaime rejects Qyburn's offer of milk of the poppy when he is operating on the stump of his sword-hand. Then again, in the books this chapter is narrated from Jaime's POV, which explicitly says that the main reason he refused to take milk of the poppy is actually because he feared that if he allowed himself to be rendered unconscious for the surgery, Qyburn might break his word and cut off the rest of his right arm anyway. As with other opioids, it is possible to become addicted to milk of the poppy if it is over-used. Heavy use of poppy milk for extended periods of time can also lead to someone's face becoming very puffy.

Ned Stark, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], [[Jon Arryn]], Robert, [[Jon Snow]], [[Drogo]], [[Hoster Tully]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], and Jaime have all been administered milk of the poppy for severe injuries at various points in the novels. According to his squire, [[Joss Stilwood]], Gregor Clegane suffers from extreme headaches (possibly caused by his gigantism) and consumes vast quantities of milk of the poppy to try and dull the pain. This might be an explanation for his near uncontrollable temper. [[Doran Martell]] and [[Robin Arryn#In the books|Robert Arryn]] take doses of milk of the poppy on a regular basis to dull their chronic pains: in such cases they are of course given smaller doses, a few drops diluted into a cup of wine by their maesters.

Milk of the poppy is widely used throughout the Known World, not just in Westeros. Several chapters describe it being used in the cities of [[Slaver's Bay]] to treat wounded pit gladiators. Even the [[Dothraki]] make use of a homemade derivative (apparently also from crushed poppy plants) called "poppy wine", though Daenerys refers to it interchangeably as "milk of the poppy", so it seems functionally close enough to the same thing.
