The '''Festival of the Mother'''{{Ref|GOT608}} is a religious holiday dedicated to the [[Mother]], an aspect of the seven-faced deity of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. Presumably, it is celebrated every year throughout [[King's Landing]] and the [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:FestivalofMother.jpg|thumb|The Great Sept of Baelor is destroyed with wildfire during the festival.]]
[[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen I]] schedules the trials of the Queen Mother [[Cersei Lannister]] and [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Loras Tyrell]] to be held at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] during the Festival of the Mother. Additionally, King Tommen declares [[trial by combat]] to be forbidden throughout the realm after conferring with the [[High Sparrow]], who holds considerable influence over the young king.{{Ref|GOT608}}

Shortly after the trial of Loras Tyrell during the festival, the Great Sept of Baelor is [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|destroyed]] with [[wildfire]] in a plot orchestrated by Cersei Lannister to avoid her trial. The plot kills nearly the entirety of the [[Faith Militant]] and the [[Sparrows]], including the High Sparrow himself, as well as a large amount of the [[Lordship|nobility]] and the [[smallfolk]] of the capital.{{Ref|GOT610}}
