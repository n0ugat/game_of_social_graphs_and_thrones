{{Quote|Ser Aron.|[[Sansa Stark]] greets Aron Santagar|The Pointy End}}
Ser '''Aron Santagar'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[Knighthood|knight]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Ser Aron is present at a court session in the [[Red Keep]], in which [[Janos Slynt]] is created Lord Slynt and given the castle of [[Harrenhal]], and later [[Barristan Selmy]] is dismissed from the [[Kingsguard]]. When [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] appears to ask for mercy for [[Eddard Stark|her father]], she greets Ser Aron, though he turns away.{{Ref|GOT108}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Aron Santagar is the Master-at-Arms of the Red Keep. He is Dornish, as revealed in the fourth novel,{{Bookref|AFFC|24}} and is described by Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] as a vain but honest man.{{Bookref|AGOT|18}}

In the first book, Ser Aron is secretly approached by Ser Rodrik to see if he might recognize the dagger used by the [[Catspaw|assassin]] sent to murder [[Bran Stark|Bran]].{{Bookref|AGOT|18}} He also participates in the Tourney of the Hand.{{Bookref|AGOT|29}}

Upon their arrival in King's Landing, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] sends [[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] to Ser Aron for training. Pod's training comes to an end when Ser Aron is killed.{{Bookref|AFFC|14}}

During the [[riots in King's Landing]], Tyrion sees Ser Aron being pulled from his saddle, the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from his grasp. His body is later found in a gutter, his head a red pulp inside a crushed helm. According to [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], four men held Ser Aron down and took turns bashing at his head with a cobblestone; the Hound intervened and gutted one, but his action did not save Ser Aron's life.{{Bookref|ACOK|41}}

In the parallel episode scene of the riot, several courtiers are shown to be attacked by the rioting mob; it is unclear if any of these were meant to be Ser Aron.

While Ser Aron died in the second novel, as of the fifth novel no specific replacement for him as Master-of-Arms at the Red Keep has been mentioned.

[[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], who has befriended [[Loras Tyrell]], tells [[Cersei Lannister|his mother]] he wishes Loras to be the new Master-of-Arms. [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] thinks too that Loras is a good choice, but Cersei - who deeply loathes all the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] - refuses to hear about it, and contemplates about appointing a Dornish for the office (because that would annoy the Tyrells).{{Bookref|AFFC|24}}
