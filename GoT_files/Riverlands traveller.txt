{{Quote|That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding.|The Riverlands traveller to [[Locke]]|Dark Wings, Dark Words}}
A '''Riverlands traveller''' was from the [[Riverlands]].

==Biography==
===Background===
He is a peasant who travels through the [[Riverlands]] to trade and sell.{{Ref|GOT302}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
He sees [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] travel in the Riverlands, and tips them off to [[Locke]]. Locke commands the [[House Bolton|Bolton]] men to give him the reward.{{Ref|GOT302}}

==In the books==
There is no mention of a traveller in the books. The noise Brienne and Jaime made while fighting was what led to their capture by a dozen of the Brave Companions, a [[Mercenary|sellsword]] company led by Vargo Hoat, the book counterpart of Locke.
