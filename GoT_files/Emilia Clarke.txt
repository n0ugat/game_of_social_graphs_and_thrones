==Quotes==
:"Sometimes I feel like the kid left out - the weirdo with the silver hair that no one likes to talk to."
:- Emilia Clarke on her role as Daenerys Targaryen, and that fact that Daenerys isn't in Westeros so she doesn't interact with most of the cast.<ref> http://www,canada.com/entertainment/movie-guide/2011+Newsmaker+Game+Thrones/5881872/story.html</ref>

==Notes==
*Following her theater career, Emilia Clarke's first major on-screen appearance was in a series of television commercials which aired in 2009 for the anti-abuse organization Samaritans. The commercials consist of Clarke, apparently having been verbally and/or physically abused, staring into the camera with wordless horror for almost a full minute as tears silently roll down her cheeks. Coincidentally, this situation of abuse is ''very'' close to that of Daenerys in the first book, ''A Game of Thrones'', and in Season 1 of the series.
*Clarke is a natural brunette and has to rotate through three very expensive wigs for her role. Consequently, even though she was catapulted to stardom by the part, very few people recognize her on the street with her natural hair. In a 2016 interview with Conan O'Brien, Clarke revealed that when she is out and about with [[Kit Harington|Kit]] or [[Gwendoline Christie|Gwen]], excited fans often ask her to take a picture for them without ever recognizing her. Rather than be put out, Emilia finds this reaction hilarious, and usually obliges in taking a photo.
*Emilia Clarke's favorite candy is "Pick'n'Mix", and she can actually be bribed with them.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/03/interview-with-emilia-clarke/ WinterIsComing.net Emilia Clarke interview]</ref>
*Clarke made her Broadway début in ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'', playing the leading role of Holly Golightly. The play began its run in February 2013.
*As of September 2012, Clarke was reported to be dating Seth MacFarlane.<ref>[http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/seth-mcfarlane-dating-game-of-thrones-emilia-clarke-2012259]</ref> On 20 March 2013, it was reported that she and MacFarlane had ended their relationship.<ref>[http://omg.yahoo.com/blogs/celeb-news/seth-macfarlane-game-thrones-star-emilia-clarke-breakup-153129472.html]</ref>
* She acts alongside former ''Game of Thrones'' co-star [[Charles Dance]] in the 2016 film ''"Me Before You"''.<ref>http://m.imdb.com/title/tt2674426/</ref>
*When asked about the most "badass" quote from the series, Clarke unhesitatingly answered "oh, ''dracarys''!" and expressed doubt that there was every really a debate on the subject.
