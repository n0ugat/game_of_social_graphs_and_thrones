==Behind the scenes==
Todder was first mentioned in Season 1's episode "You Win or You Die", but he didn't appear on-screen until Season 3's episode "Mhysa". Even then, the actor wasn't identified by name to be playing Todder until Season 5's episode "Hardhome".

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Todder is the son of a winesink owner. He is described as a short, ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. He has pig eyes, small and shiny. Instead of a Builder, Toad is made a [[Ranger]]. He is among the friends that prevent Jon from abandoning the Night's Watch and joining [[Robb Stark]].

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Toad complains about [[Melisandre]]'s preaching, that she calls the Seven and the old gods false gods, and made the wildlings burn weirwood branches. Later, Jon sends him to serve at the [[Shadow Tower]].
