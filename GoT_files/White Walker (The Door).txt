===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
During an attack at the [[cave of the Three-Eyed Raven]] lead by the [[Night King]], the White Walker steps inside and is attacked by a Child of the Forest with a spear, but the spear does little to no damage and the Child is quickly killed by the Walker. After doing so, [[Meera Reed|Meera]] attacks the Walker with what seems to be a spear made out of [[dragonglass]], causing him to break into ice almost immediately.{{Ref|GOT605}}
