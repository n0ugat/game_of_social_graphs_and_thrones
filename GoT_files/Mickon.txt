Mickon and [[Grand Maester]] [[Mellos]] attend to an infected wound on [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys]]'s back. When Mellos suggests leeching it, Mickon instead suggests cauterization.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Mickon. It is mentioned that younger maesters had more success as physicians than Grand Maester Mellos, whose go-to solution with most health issues was leeching.
