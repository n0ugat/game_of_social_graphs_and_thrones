==Biography==
===Background===
Steffon is a son of Lord [[Gunthor Darklyn]] of [[Duskendale]].{{Ref|HOTD204}} Despite being the heir to the [[Dun Fort]],{{Ref|HOTD207}} he joined the Kingsguard of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]], and has continued to serve the Old King's successor Viserys I.{{Guideref|Steffon Darklyn}} He is the great-great-grandson of [[Aeriana Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD206}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Steffon informs Viserys of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s return from [[Dragonstone]]. He later escorts Rhaenyra to Viserys's chambers in [[Maegor's Holdfast]].{{Ref|HOTD102}}

20 years later, Steffon announces Rhaenyra's return to the [[Red Keep]]. He is later present when [[Vaemond Velaryon]] petitions the Crown to name him heir to [[Driftmark]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Steffon and [[Lorent Marbrand]] are assigned to Rhaenyra at Dragonstone when King Viserys dies. He oversees a sparring match between Princes [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon]]: when Jace angrily berates Luke for his poor form in the bout, Steffon gently suggests Jace might go easier on his younger brother so Luke can learn what Jace is trying to teach. They both swear allegiance to Rhaenyra as queen when [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] threatens to have [[Caraxes]] burn them as turncloaks if they choose otherwise, though Steffon truly believes that Rhaenyra is the rightful heir.{{Guideref|Steffon Darklyn}} They later attend the funeral of Rhaenyra's stillborn daughter [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]] and move to protect Rhaenyra when [[Erryk Cargyll]] arrives.

Steffon is present at a session of the Black Council when word of Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys's]] [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murder]] and the subsequent propaganda campaign of the [[Greens]] to vilify Rhaenyra for ordering the killing reaches Dragonstone. Steffon also brings [[Mysaria]] from her cell to Rhaenyra's chambers and remains on guard duty as Rhaenyra interrogates Mysaria about her role in helping Daemon orchestrate the assassination.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Steffon accompanies Rhaenyra to King's Landing, disguised as a [[septon]], as part of Rhaenyra's plan to speak with Dowager Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict. Steffon remains outside the [[Grand Sept]] as Rhaenyra, disguised as a [[septa]] slips into the sept to speak with Alicent. He hides a dagger up the sleeve of his septon's robe, sits on the sept's stairs and reads from a holy book as part of his disguise as he nervously waits for Rhaenyra to return.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Steffon returns to Dragonstone with Rhaenyra. At a session of the Black Council, he is informed by Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] of the sack of Duskendale and his father's execution at [[Criston Cole]]'s hands for refusing to bend the knee to King Aegon II, much to his horror.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Following the Black defeat and the deaths of Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and [[Meleys]] at the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]], Steffon is present at a session of the Black Council, where he urges a strong response in retaliation for their losses. {{Ref|HOTD205}}

Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of the [[Dragonkeepers]], Seasmoke reacts violently to Steffon approaching him and burns the Queensguard and a nearby Dragonkeeper alive.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

:''"Member of the Kingsguard."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

:''"A knight on the black council and commander of Rhaenyra’s Queensguard."''<ref name="WBD2" />

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Steffon is the uncle of [[Gunthor Darklyn]], not his son. Ser Harrold Darke, a cousin of the Darklyns, once served as his [[squire]].

Ser Steffon was a member of the Kingsguard during the reign of King Viserys I. In 129 AC, following Viserys's death and the coronation of Aegon II, he (not [[Erryk Cargyll]]) stole the crown and delivered it to Rhaenyra. It is not mentioned that Steffon was a member of Jaehaerys I's Kingsguard.
