{{Quote|The next Grand Maester dared object to Maegor taking a third wife when taking a second wife had ruined his brother's reign because Maegor's first wife was the niece of the High Septon.|[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel (short)}}
A '''High Septon''' served as head of the [[Faith of the Seven]] during the reign of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon I]].

==Biography==
He was the maternal uncle of [[Ceryse Hightower]], [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]]'s first wife. Because of the High Septon's ties to Ceryse, Maegor's subsequent polygamous marriage to [[Alys Harroway]] ruined the reign of his brother [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys]] and sowed the first seeds of the [[Faith Militant uprising]].{{Ref|H&L806}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the High Septon objected to Queen [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]]'s proposal to betroth her son Maegor to Aenys's daughter [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena]], and instead suggested his niece Ceryse Hightower. King Aegon agreed, and the High Septon presided over their wedding in the [[Starry Sept]] in 25 AC.{{Bookref|F&B|4}}
