'''Aya''' is a young girl working at a brothel in [[Braavos]].

==Biography==
===Background===
It isn't clear if she is actually a child prostitute or just a servant girl working at the brothel, though, considering her common attire and state of general confusion when presented to Trant, the latter is likely.{{Ref|GOT509}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
The [[Braavosi madam]] is present when Ser [[Meryn Trant]] visits the brothel she works in, seeking a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. She presents three prostitutes - an unnamed prostitute, [[Brea]], and [[Anara]] - to him, but he claims that they are all too old. Realizing with some distaste what Trant is seeking, she presents him with a very young serving girl. Trant informs the madam that he expects a "fresh" one tomorrow night, again to her distaste. Throughout the exchange, the Madam is vexed by the presence of "[[Arya Stark|Lanna]]," a young oyster-seller, so deep in the brothel, and warns her not to show up there again.{{Ref|GOT509}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no such character.
