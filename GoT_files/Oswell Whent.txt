Ser '''Oswell Whent''' was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Whent]] and a sworn brother of the [[Kingsguard]] under [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. 

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Ser Oswell is mentioned in the entry of his sworn brother, Lord Commander [[Gerold Hightower]] as recorded in the ''[[Book of Brothers]]''. The entry mentions the death of Ser Oswell in the [[Red Mountains]] of [[Dorne]] after refusing to [[bending the knee|bend the knee]] to the new king, [[Robert Baratheon]].{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Oswell Whent was a younger brother of Lord Whent, known and remembered for his dark humor. He wore a distinctive helmet emblazoned with a black bat with its wings spread, symbolizing House Whent. 

Oswell was present at the [[Tournament|Tourney]] at Harrenhal where [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] became a Kingsguard. 

Ser Oswell was present with Ser [[Gerold Hightower]] and Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] in the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy]] with [[Eddard Stark]]. After Ser Gerold told Eddard they were not at the [[Battle of the Trident]], Ser Oswell declared, "Woe to the Usurper if we had been." He and his two brothers were slain along with the bulk of Eddard's force in the ensuing melee.
