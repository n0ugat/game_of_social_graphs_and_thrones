{{Quote|The [[Temple of the Moonsingers]] is the foremost of these, being the faith of the [[Slavery|slave]] women whose prophecies led our ancestors here. The [[Lord of Light]] has a [[Red Temple of Braavos|great temple]] as well, for his worshippers have grown more numerous in the past hundred years. Yet, less numerous and even some forgotten faiths still have temples deep in the heart of the city on the Isle of the Gods.|[[Tycho Nestoris]]|Braavos (short)}}
The '''Isle of the Gods'''{{Ref|H&L504}} is an island located at the heart of [[Braavos]]. It houses temples for its religious citizens who do not worship in the [[Temple of the Moonsingers]] or the [[Red Temple of Braavos]].<ref>"[[Braavos (short)|Braavos]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Isle of the Gods is located at the center of [[Braavos]] near the junction of the Canal of Heroes and the [[Long Canal]]. It is named for the fact that its vicinity holds many temples and shrines. It is surrounded by major temples, with the [[Red Temple of Braavos|Temple of the Lord of Light]], the [[Temple of the Moonsingers]] to the northwest, the [[House of Black and White]] to the south and the Sept-Beyond-the-Sea to the southwest.
