The '''Forest of Qohor'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is an extremely large area of woodland and forest on the eastern continent of [[Essos]]. It borders the [[Free Cities]] region to the east and the [[Dothraki Sea]] to the northwest. The [[Shivering Sea]] lies to the north. It contains the headlands of the [[Qhoyne]] river.

The Free City of [[Qohor]] is located on the forest's western edge. Despite its sheer size, the forest presents no significant obstacle to [[Dothraki]] ''[[khalasar]]s'', which can pass through the forest with impunity.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
The ''khalasar'' of Khal [[Drogo]] passes through the Forest of Qohor on its way from [[Pentos]] to [[Vaes Dothrak]]. Based on comments by Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], it is possible that the immensely tall forest of reeds that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] orders the ''khalasar'' to halt in is part of the Forest of Qohor.<ref>[[Lord Snow]]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Forest of Qohor is traversed by Drogo's ''khalasar'', taking half a month to pass through its eaves. The trees are huge, with barks as big as city gates and possessing leaves that give off a golden hue in the sunlight. Lemurs, spotted tigers, and great elks are found within the forest.
