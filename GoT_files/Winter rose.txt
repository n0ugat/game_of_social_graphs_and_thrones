{{Quote|He rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost.|[[Petyr Baelish]] describing how [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] gave winter roses to [[Lyanna Stark]]|Sons of the Harpy (episode)}}
The '''winter rose'''{{Ref|GOT504}} is a type of flower that grows in [[Westeros]]. It is said to be blue as frost.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
At the tomb of her aunt [[Lyanna Stark]], [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] recalls to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] how [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] and Lyanna were present at the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]] when he was a boy. Rhaegar won the final joust of the [[tournament]], and the entire massive crowd cheered - only to suddenly drop dead silent as Rhaegar rode past his wife [[Elia Martell]], and instead placed the victor's crown of winter roses onto Lyanna's lap. Not long afterwards, Rhaegar ran off with Lyanna, sparking off [[Robert's Rebellion]], leading to the deaths of thousands and the fall of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]].{{Ref|GOT504}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lyanna Stark was very fond of winter roses, and loved their scent. Eddard often thinks of them in association with Lyanna. Even the statue of Lyanna at her tomb underneath [[Winterfell]] is holding a garland of winter roses.

One of the visions [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] sees in the [[House of the Undying]] is a blue flower grows from a chink in a wall of ice, and fills the air with sweetness (perhaps implying [[Jon Snow]]'s true parentage).
