'''Stoney Sept'''{{Ref|H&L114}} is a large town in the [[Riverlands]], the region controlled by [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. The town is located south-east of Riverrun, near the border of the [[Westerlands]] and close to the source of the [[Blackwater Rush]].

==History==
Stoney Sept was the site of one of the most important battles of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. [[Robert Baratheon]] hid in the town with the aid of the [[smallfolk]]. When the royal army, led by the [[Hand of the King]] [[Jon Connington]], arrived to search the town from house to house, the bells of the local [[sept]] were rung, giving the ensuing battle its name: the [[Battle of the Bells]]. The arrival of [[Eddard Stark]], [[Jon Arryn]], and [[Hoster Tully]] secured the rebel victory.<ref>"[[Robert's Rebellion - House Baratheon]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Stoney Sept refers to a sept and its surrounding town. The sept itself sits on a hill. Below it is a holdfast made of grey stone that seems undersized for the town that surrounds it. The heart of Stoney Sept is a market square with a fountain in the shape of a leaping trout. Stoney Sept isn't nearly big enough to be considered even a minor city, but it is a fairly large market town.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is brought to Stoney Sept after she encounters the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], and notes that it is the biggest town she's seen since she left [[King's Landing]]. She meets there a prostitute named Bella, who claims that she is Robert's bastard, and was named after the battle of the Bells; it is unknown whether it is true.
