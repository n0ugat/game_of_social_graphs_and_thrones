==Biography==
===Background===
Loreza Sand is the last of the eight [[bastard]] daughters of [[Prince]] [[Oberyn Martell]], known as the "[[Sand Snakes]]".{{Ref|GOT405}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===

==Family==

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Loreza's story is the same. Loreza is only six years old during the events of the fourth and fifth novels (corresponding to Season 5 of the TV series), so she has not done much yet within the narrative.

After [[Doran Martell]] hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he orders to arrest them lest they ignite a war with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and their younger sisters too (except [[Sarella Sand|Sarella]]), fearing that the young Sand Snakes may be used by others in plots against him. Loreza is sent to the [[Water Gardens]] alongside her mother and her three sisters. Following the arrival of Ser [[Balon Swann]], Doran releases Loreza, her mother and sisters.

In "Arianne I" sample chapter from the sixth novel, it is mentioned Loreza, who has just turned seven, is currently traveling with her mother to [[Hellholt]], seat of her grandfather Harmen Uller.
