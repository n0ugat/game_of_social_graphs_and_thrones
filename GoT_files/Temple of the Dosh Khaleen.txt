The '''Temple of the ''Dosh Khaleen'''''{{Ref|GOT601}}{{Note|[[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]]: ''vaesof doshi khaleen''}} is the most important of the few permanent buildings in [[Vaes Dothrak]], the capital and only city of the [[Dothraki]]. It the seat of the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]'', the widows of the Dothraki ''[[khal]]i'', who oversee the religion of the Dothraki, advise the ''khali'', and administrate Vaes Dothrak.

==History==
===Background===
When a ''khal'' dies, his ''khaleesi'' is expected to return to Vaes Dothrak at the earliest possibility to join the ''Dosh Khaleen'' and take up residence in the temple. It is a great and potentially problematic violation of tradition if a ''khaleesi'' elects not to do this.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref> In addition to serving as the communal residence of the ''Dosh Khaleen'', the temple is used to host important ceremonies and the occasional feast for the current Great ''Khal''.<ref>"[[A Golden Crown]]"</ref> The ''[[Khalar Vezhven]]'', the gathering of ''khali'' to determine which cities to plunder and which populations to enslave, is held within the temple.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref>

[[File:Daenerys flanked by dosh khaleen.png|thumb|Daenerys eats a [[stallion heart]] in a ritual conducted by the ''Dosh Khaleen'' (seen behind her)]]
[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] is summoned by the ''Dosh Khaleen'' to eat a stallion's heart so that the crones can read the omens, with the ceremony taking place in the temple itself. At first it seems she won't hold the raw meat down, but to both her and [[Drogo]]'s relief she is able to compose herself. The crones declare Daenerys and Drogo's son will be the [[stallion who mounts the world]], a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in Dothraki history. Daenerys says his name will be [[Rhaego]], after her brother Rhaegar Targaryen who was slain in the rebellion by [[Robert Baratheon]]. Later on, Dany's brother [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] interrupts a feast held within the temple, and commits the ultimate sacrilege by drawing a weapon. ''Khal'' Drogo, careful not to violate tradition himself, melts down some gold in a pot and pours it over Viserys's head, killing him; a bloodless death that is tolerated by both Daenerys and the ''Dosh Khaleen''.<ref>"[[A Golden Crown]]"</ref>
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
After being captured by the Dothraki, Daenerys was offered to ''Khal'' [[Moro]] as a gift. She eventually earned the respect of the ''khal'' after explaining to him that she was ''Khal'' Drogo's wife. However, instead of escorting her to Meereen as per her request, ''Khal'' [[Moro's wife 1|Moro's wife]] tells her that she must remain in the temple of Vaes Dothrak with the ''Dosh Khaleen'' for the rest of her life as she was a widow of a ''khal'' and a former ''khaleesi''.<ref>"[[The Red Woman]]"</ref>
[[File:Book of the Stranger 22.jpg|thumb|The Khals gather in the Temple.]]
Daenerys is welcomed to the temple by the [[High Priestess (Oathbreaker)|High Priestess]], who admonishes her for not returning to the temple immediately after ''Khal'' Drogo's death. She relates her own history as the wife of ''Khal'' [[Savo]] to connect with Daenerys, but warns her that because she violated tradition, it is up to the ''khali'' assembling for the ''[[Khalar Vezhven]]'' to decide whether Daenerys will join their ranks.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref>

Later on, the High Priestess, clearly hoping that Daenerys will be allowed to stay with them, explains the politics of the ''Dosh Khaleen'', and that some of them dislike Daenerys and her obvious Valyrian features, thinking that the Dothraki shouldn't breed with outsiders. The High Priestess dismisses them, however, pointing out that the Dothraki have always interbred and taken outsiders as ''khaleesi''. She points out a ''khaleen'' of [[Lhazareen]] origin to illustrate her point.

The ''Khalar Vezhven'', is held within the temple, although the ''Dosh Khaleen'' themselves only make an appearance to bring Daenerys before the khals to be judged. The Mother of Dragons turns the tables on the khals and destroys the Temple of the ''Dosh Khaleen'', killing everyone inside. The ''Dosh Khaleen'' are amongst the crowd gathering to watch the conflagration, and when they see Daenerys emerge from the flames unburnt, they bow with the rest.<ref>"[[Book of the Stranger]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels, the temple is much the same.
