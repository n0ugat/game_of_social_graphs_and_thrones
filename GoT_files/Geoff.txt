{{Quote|All my life I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep. The Sept of Baelor is blown to hell and the Dragonpit, it's a damn ruin.|Geoff|Dragonstone (episode)}}

He is sitting by a campfire with his comrades singing a [[For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm|song]] when [[Arya Stark|Arya]] approaches their camp. They offer to share their food and wine with her and she accepts their invitation. He gives her a rabbit they have cooked some blackberry wine that he has made. He reminisces about his mother, who had told him that strangers would be kind to him if he was kind to them, and his father, all alone on his boat and wishing he was there with him. He laughs along with the others when Arya tells them that she is going to [[King's Landing]] with the intention of killing [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], mistaking it for a joke.{{Ref|GOT701}}
