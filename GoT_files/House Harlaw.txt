==History==
House Harlaw was in service to [[House Hoare]] during the reign of [[Qhorwyn Hoare]]. After the [[kingsmoot]] elected his formerly banished son [[Harwyn Hoare]] as [[King of the Iron Islands]], he gathered the armies of the [[Iron Islands]], including those of House Harlaw and [[House Drumm]] and attacked the mainland of [[Westeros]].{{Ref|H&L602}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Harlaw is a powerful family with strong ties to the Greyjoys. They have several branches along the island of Harlaw, as well as several vassals. The sigil of House Harlaw is a silver scythe on black. 

The current head of the family is Lord Rodrik Harlaw, brother of Lady [[Alannys Greyjoy|Alannys Harlaw]], called Rodrik the Reader for his passion for books (a habit that other ironmen find strange and unmanly).{{Bookref|AFFC|11}} House Harlaw also possesses [[Nightfall]], a [[Valyrian steel]] sword that previously belonged to [[Dalton Greyjoy]].{{Bookref|AFFC|29}}

As one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the Iron Islands, House Harlaw has multiple [[cadet branch]]es:
*House Harlaw of Harlaw Hall
*House Harlaw of Grey Garden
*House Harlaw of Tower of Glimmering
*House Harlaw of Harridan Hill
