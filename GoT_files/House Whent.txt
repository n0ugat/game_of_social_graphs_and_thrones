'''House Whent'''{{Guideref|Viewer's Guide}} of [[Harrenhal]] is a vassal house of the [[Riverlands]] that held fealty to [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. Their lands were along the north shore of [[Gods Eye]], which they ruled from the huge and formidable castle of Harrenhal.<ref name="House Tully viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-2/episode-4/map/location/22 HBO viewers guide, season 2: episode 4 map, Harrenhal entry]</ref> The Whents were granted Harrenhal after the extinction of [[House Lothston]].

Their [[Heraldry|heraldry]] consists of nine black bats over an orange field. Their words are unknown. Their heraldry is apparently derived from the previous holders of Harrenhal, as House Lothston's heraldry was a single black bat over a field diagonally divided between gold and silver. Whether this indicates a family relationship, or simply references that they took House Lothston's old seat, is unclear.

==In the books==
[[File:House Whent ASOIAF.svg|thumb|200px|The Whent coat of arms in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels: nine black bats, 4, 3, 2, on yellow.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Harrenhal is a castle of ill repute. Every house that has held it has fallen into ruin. House Lothston, who held Harrenhal before the Whents, disintegrated in madness and fell deeds over half a century before the events of the series. The Whents chose to ignore this when they took possession of the castle, and indeed seemed to prosper.

However, since that time the family has fallen on harder times. Lady Shella Whent's husband and children have all died. As a result, Lady Shella is left as a lonely old woman with her household inhabiting a vast and crumbling ruin.

Lady Shella Whent is stated to have died (but it is not confirmed) soon before lordship of the castle was granted to [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], at which point House Whent was considered extinct by the crown - though the current generation of Tullys seem to have a claim on the lands, this was apparently ignored because they were in rebellion against the Iron Throne. Due to the alleged curse of Harrenhal (this is the reason Littlefinger gives Sansa, but he may have other reason), Littlefinger doesn't physically settle at Harrenhal after being named its lord, and treats the title as purely nominal - ignoring the devastated Riverlands to focus on wooing [[Lysa Arryn]] in the Vale. Harrenhal is retaken by a Lannister army led by [[Gregor Clegane]] soon before the [[Red Wedding]], when [[Roose Bolton]] retreated his remaining garrison back to the [[Twins]]. Following the Red Wedding, it remains in control of a Lannister garrison. Having been seized, liberated, and retaken so many times, practically all of the original Whent servants who inhabited the castle were put to the sword by this point, save for only one washer-girl, one blacksmith and one cook.

In the novels, House Whent's [[Heraldry]] is said to be nine black bats on a yellow field, but it wasn't said how they were arranged. Only in a later semi-canon listing that Martin gave to Westeros.org was it specified that they are arranged in three rows: four in the top row, then three in the middle, and two on the bottom. The House Whent heraldry observed in Season 1 of the TV series however, arranged them differently, with one bat in the middle surrounded by the eight other bats arranged into a diamond shape (five rows top to bottom, with three in the widest row, then two, then one. This may have just been due to confusion in Season 1, however, because in the ''[[Histories & Lore]]'' featurettes for both Season 2 and Season 5, the sigil of House Whent was arranged in the 4-3-2 pattern. For that matter, the Season 1 sigil was depicted as orange instead of yellow - though this is an easy mistake to make, because "gold"-colored in heraldry can mean a wide rang of colors from yellow to orange. The colorized version of the Whent heraldry in the Season 5 Histories & Lore also used a yellow background, as in the description given for the book continuity.
