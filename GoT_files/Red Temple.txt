{{Quote|I was born the youngest of eight in Myr, across the Narrow Sea, so my father gave me over to the Red Temple. In their wisdom they decided to make me a priest instead of a warrior or a temple prostitute like other children.|[[Thoros]] of [[Myr]]|Lord of Light (short)}}
'''Red Temples'''{{Ref|GOT605}} are the places of worship in the religion of the [[Lord of Light]], called "Red" because of the color's association with the god. They are occupied not only by [[red priest]]s but also temple warriors as well as temple [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] of both sexes.

Red Temples are prominent throughout [[Essos]], where the faith in the Lord of Light is strong. Of particular note are the Red Temples in [[Volantis]] and [[Myr]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Red Temples are where red priests conduct their devotions every evening, lighting a fire and praying throughout the entire night for R'hllor to bring back the dawn. In places where belief in the Lord of Light is strong, Red Temples receive children and also also buy them to be raised as priests, warriors and temple prostitutes. Bought [[Slavery|slave]] children are given the title of Slave of R'hllor and are often branded with flaming tattoos across their faces. Those raised as warriors to protect the temples are known as the Fiery Hand.

There are Red Temples in all of the Free Cities, some of the greatest being those in [[Lys]] and Volantis. The Red Temple in Volantis is massive, three times the size of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] in [[King's Landing]]. There's also a Red Temple in [[Selhorys]] as well as a small one in [[Oldtown]] visited by sailors. Many religions are worshiped in [[Braavos]], and while only a small minority follow R'hllor, the city does have a small Red Temple, alongside the temples to other religions.
