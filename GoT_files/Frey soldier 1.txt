{{Quote|Does 'fuck off' mean something different where you're from?|The soldier to [[Arya Stark]].|Mhysa}}
A '''Frey soldier''' was a soldier in service to [[House Frey]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The Frey soldier partook in the [[Red Wedding]].{{Ref|GOT310}}

The soldier is first seen at a campfire with three fellow Frey soldiers, mocking the death of [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and spreading stories on how he attached [[Grey Wind]]'s head to [[Robb Stark|Robb]]'s body. While [[Frey soldier 2|one of the other men]] doesn't immediately believe this, saying that many of the Frey men would claim to have done the act, the soldier insists that with help from [[Malcolm]] and [[Talbot]], he sewed Grey Wind's head onto Robb's body, mentioning how difficult it was to do so.{{Ref|GOT310}}

[[Arya Stark|Arya]], who passes the Freys along with [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], jumps off the horse and walks up to the Freys, engaging in a conversation. She asks for a meal, whereas one of the soldiers simply orders her to "fuck off". Arya states that she is hungry, and the soldier asks her what part of "fuck off" she doesn't understand. Arya claims to have money, showing the coin of [[Braavos]] that [[Jaqen H'ghar]] gave her.{{Ref|GOT310}}

The soldier seems interested, reaching his hand out for the coin. Arya, however, drops the latter by 'accident' and apologizes. The soldier calls her a "little shit" and leans down to retrieve the coin. Before even grasping it, Arya pulls the man off of the wooden log and repeatedly stabs him in the neck. As the other three soldiers join the brawl, Clegane intervenes and kills them as the stabbed Frey soldier bleeds profusely.{{Ref|GOT310}}

After the brawl is over, the Hound walks over to Arya, who is coldly staring down at the corpse of the Frey soldier she stabbed. He asks her if this was the first man she has ever killed. She confirms that it was the "[[Stableboy|first ''man'']]". Before leaving, Arya retrieves the coin and mumbles the words Valar Morghulis.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no such encounter. [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] hears from [[Salladhor Saan]] how the Freys desecrated Robb's corpse and sewed Grey Wind's head to it.

However, the trick with the coin Arya uses on the soldier is based on the way she tricks and kills a guard when she flees [[Harrenhal]], after the castle is seize by the Northern army led by [[Roose Bolton]]. Also, Arya stabs the [[Tickler]] multiple times (as a payback for torturing many people to death), but that happens later in the book.
