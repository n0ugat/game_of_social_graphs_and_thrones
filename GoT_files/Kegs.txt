==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Along with [[Jack Bulwer|Black Jack Bulwer]] and [[Mully]], he travels to the [[Prostitution|brothel]] in [[Mole's Town]]. They sit drinking and listening to a [[Mole's Town whore|whore]] belching out the melodies to popular songs. Kegs guesses that she is belching "[[The Rains of Castamere]]," and she chastises him for getting it wrong. They are later slaughtered when a group of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] led by [[Tormund]] and [[Styr]] [[Sack of Mole's Town|attack the village]]. News of their deaths soon reaches [[Castle Black]].{{Ref|GOT408}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Kegs is a [[Builder]] of the Night's Watch. He is noted to be slow. He is not killed in a wildling attack on Mole's Town. 

During the Battle of Castle Black, while retreating with other defenders to the stair, Kegs is caught and nearly killed by a [[Thenns|Thenn]], but he is saved by a crossbow shot from Satin. So far he is alive and well.
