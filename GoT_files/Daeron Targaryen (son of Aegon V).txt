{{Quote|I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the moment I saw my intended with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do.|[[Olenna Tyrell]]|Oathkeeper (episode)}}
Prince '''Daeron Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Dāeron Targārien''}}{{Con|TWOI&F}} was a prince of the Targaryen dynasty. He was the younger brother of [[Aerys II Targaryen]], uncle of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]], and [[Daenerys Targaryen]], and great-uncle of [[Jon Snow]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Daeron was the youngest son of King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V Targaryen]]. He was betrothed to [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna Redwyne]], but she took a great dislike to his "twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair", and their engagement ended when Olenna seduced her sister [[Viola Redwyne|Viola]]'s intended husband [[Luthor Tyrell]].{{Ref|GOT404}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After [[Margaery Tyrell]] unexpectedly becomes a widow when King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] is [[Purple Wedding|murdered at their wedding feast]] and worries she will not be married to his younger brother and successor [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], her grandmother Olenna recounts the story of how she escaped her engagement to Daeron as a lesson on how to manipulate Tommen into wanting their marriage.{{Ref|GOT404}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Olenna Tyrell]] tells [[Sansa Stark]] over supper at their first meeting about how she ended her betrothal to a Targaryen prince, but he is never specifically named.

In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', this Prince is revealed as Daeron Targaryen, the youngest son of King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V Targaryen]]. ''The World of Ice & Fire'' reveals that Olenna was not the one to break off the betrothal, but Daeron himself because he preferred the companionship of Ser Jeremy Norridge, a young knight that he befriended while [[Squire|squiring]] together at [[Highgarden]]. The two later die together in battle quashing a small rebellion. It should be pointed out that the sourcebook is written in-universe, as though it were a historical text by a Maester. This in-universe narrator may therefore not have known about what (or who) Olenna was doing behind the scenes to ensure her preferred outcome.

In the [[Fire and Blood|final episode]] of [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]], [[Aemon|Maester Aemon]] says King Aegon V Targaryen was his younger brother and Aegon V's successor was his son King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] better known as the Mad King. In ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels the Mad King's father was King Jaehaerys II Targaryen, King Aegon V's second son and Prince Daeron's older brother. Removing this generation from ''Games of Thrones'' canon makes conjecture based off the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels and ''The World of Ice & Fire'' companion book more difficult.
