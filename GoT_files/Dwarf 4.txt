A '''dwarf''' makes a living by performing for other peoples' amusement.

==Biography==
===Background===
A [[dwarf]], he makes a living by performing for other peoples' amusement.{{Ref|GOT402}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Along with a group of other dwarfs, he takes part in a mock "reenactment" of the [[War of the Five Kings]] at [[Purple Wedding|King Joffrey's wedding]]. He dresses as [[Robb Stark]] and rides a horse while wearing a wolf's head helmet - cruelly mocking how Robb's corpse was desecrated at the [[Red Wedding]], by having his head cut off and his [[direwolf]] [[Grey Wind]]'s head sewn on in its place. [[Sansa Stark]] is visibly upset by this cruel mockery of her deceased brother.{{Ref|GOT402}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are only two dwarfs jousting. The one meant as a mockery of Robb bears a shield depicting the direwolf of [[House Stark]]. They ride live animals, a dog and a sow. Their real names are revealed in ''A Dance with Dragons'' - Oppo (aka Groat) and his sister Penny.
