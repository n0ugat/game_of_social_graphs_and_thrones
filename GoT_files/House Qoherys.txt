'''House Qoherys'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} of [[Harrenhal]] is an extinct noble house of the [[Riverlands]]. Their sigil was a flaming saltire, red and yellow, between four white skulls, on black.

Their seat was the castle of Harrenhal, which was granted to their founder, the Targaryen general [[Quenton Qoherys]], by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] as a reward for his service in [[Aegon's Conquest]]. However, House Qoherys eventually became extinct, and the castle was passed on to [[House Harroway]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Qoherys' backstory is the same. They were battle-companions of Aegon the Conqueror, and like [[House Targaryen]] they were of [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] descent.

Quenton Qoherys had previously served as the [[master-at-arms]] at [[Dragonstone]]. His line did not last long, however. He was succeeded by his grandson Gargon, known as Gargon the Guest due to his habit of visiting every wedding in his domain and claiming the lord's right of first night that allowed him to bed the bride.

During a rebellion by Harren the Red, self-proclaimed grandson of [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]], the father of a maid whose virginity had been taken by Gargon allowed Harren to enter Harrenhal. Harren then gelded and murdered Gargon, and all of the castle's inhabitants were put to the sword, rendering House Qoherys extinct. They were replaced as the rulers of Harrenhal by House Harroway.
