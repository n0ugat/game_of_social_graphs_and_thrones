{{Quote|But no maester can tell why. Even in our oldest records, the island on which it stands is called Battle Isle. What battle was fought there? And when? |[[Qyburn]]|Oldtown (short)}}
'''Battle Isle'''{{Ref|H&L612}} is an island on the [[Honeywine]], in the second largest city of [[Westeros]], [[Oldtown]]. The isle occupies the [[Hightower]], the seat of [[House Hightower]].

==History==
It is unknown why the island is so named, however, at some point, the [[Hightower]] was built atop it. Even the [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] of the [[Citadel]] do not have any records of a battle on this isle.<ref>"[[Oldtown (short)|Oldtown]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Battle Island sits in [[Oldtown]] in the area where the [[Honeywine]] widens and empties into [[Whispering Sound]]. It is unknown how the island earned its name, though some stories claim that [[dragon]]s once roosted on it until they were killed by the founder of [[House Hightower]].
