Lord '''Walter Whent'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the [[Lord of Harrenhal]] and head of [[House Whent]]. In the [[Year of the False Spring]], he hosted an [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal|extravagant tournament]] at [[Harrenhal]] that brought many from across [[Seven Kingdoms|the realm]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Lord Whent was the head of [[House Whent]] and the [[Lord of Harrenhal]].{{Ref|GOT504}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Petyr Baelish]] discusses with [[Sansa Stark]] the great [[Tournament|tourney]] that Lord Whent held at [[Harrenhal]], at which Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] shocked the realm by naming [[Lyanna Stark]] the [[queen of love and beauty]] instead of his own wife Princess [[Elia Martell]].{{Ref|GOT504}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lord Whent's first name is never given and comes from the companion book ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]''.

Old Lord Whent hosted a great [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Harrenhal]] in 281 AC, the [[Year of the False Spring]]. The tourney was held to honor his maiden daughter, who held the title of [[queen of love and beauty]] when the tourney began. Her crown was defended by her four brothers and her uncle, Ser [[Oswell Whent]] of the [[Kingsguard]]. Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] won the tourney and named [[Lyanna Stark]] the queen of love and beauty rather than his wife Princess [[Elia Martell]], to the shock of all of [[Westeros]].

Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] states that he defended a Lord Whent at a tourney at [[Lannisport]] in 289 AC, though is unclear if this was Lord Walter or a descendant of his.
