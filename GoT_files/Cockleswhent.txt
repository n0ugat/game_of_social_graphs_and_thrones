The '''Cockleswhent'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a river in the [[Reach]], the region of [[Westeros]] under the control of [[House Tyrell]] of [[Highgarden]]. It is a tributary of the [[Mander]]. It flows west from headlands near the border with the [[Stormlands]] into the Mander near [[Cider Hall]]. It runs past [[Ashford]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the river is spelt "Cockleswent". Whether the HBO version is a misspelling or a deliberate change of spelling is unknown.
