'''Nightsong'''{{Ref|GOT701}} is a castle in the [[Stormlands]]. It is the seat of [[House Caron]], a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]]. The castle is located south-west of Storm's End near the border with [[Dorne]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Nightsong is a major stronghold of the Dornish Marches. House Caron are known as the "Lords of the Marches", suggesting they may have some superior authority over the other march lords (such as [[House Dondarrion]]). Houses Caron and Dondarrion allied together to fight the Vulture King, a bandit lord based in the [[Red Mountains]], some ninety years before the events of the books. Ser Arlen of Pennytree and his squire, the future Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], accompanied this campaign.

In the books, House Caron is effectively destroyed when its last surviving members are killed during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], resulting in the castle of Nightsong passing to House Foote.
