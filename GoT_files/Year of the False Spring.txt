In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Year of the False Spring was the name commonly given to the year 281 after [[Aegon's Conquest]]. It was so-named because an entire spring season occurred during that year, lasting only two months (when seasons in the world of [[Westeros]] often last at least one or two years).

It was the year in which [[Rickard Stark|Rickard]] and [[Brandon Stark]] were executed by the Mad King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] for alleged treason.

Several important characters were also born in this year, including [[Brienne of Tarth]], [[Loras Tyrell]], and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]].
