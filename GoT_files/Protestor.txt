[[File:Protestor 2x5.png|thumb|Tyrion and Bronn listen to the protestor.]]
The protestor is addressing a group of [[smallfolk]] on the streets of [[King's Landing]]. He says that the city is foul with corruption and blames [[Joffrey Baratheon]] as the product of incest between Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and her brother [[Jaime Lannister]]. He also describes Joffrey as a puppet king to [[Tyrion Lannister]], whom he refers to as a "twisted demon monkey", causing his audience to erupt in laughter.{{Ref|GOT205}}

==In the books==
In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', a number of individuals, particularly "begging brothers" - the lowest among the clergy of the [[Faith of the Seven]] - begin to speak out against King Joffrey, Queen Cersei and Tyrion, incensed by Stannis' letter and the growing famine in King's Landing due to [[House Tyrell]] closing off the [[Roseroad]] - through which most foodstuffs reach the capital. These men also speak out against the leadership of the [[Faith of the Seven]] - both the High Septon and the Most Devout -, accusing them of corruption and fornication.
