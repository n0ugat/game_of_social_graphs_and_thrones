The '''spears of the merling king'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} are a geographic feature in [[Blackwater Bay]]. They are a group of rocky and barren islets and seamonts rising above the water.

The spears of the merling king are named after the [[Merling King]], a deity commonly revered by sailors.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Following the [[wildfire]] explosion that threw him into the ocean during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], [[Davos Seaworth]] washes ashore to one of the spears. After having suffered from hunger, drought, and exposure for several days, he's finally rescued by [[Salladhor Saan]]'s crew men.<ref>"[[Valar Dohaeris]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, it is said that for every spear that breaks the surface a dozen more lie just beneath. For this reason, it is considered quite dangerous for any ship to sail into the Spears, as the hidden monts will rip the bottom of any passing vessel.
