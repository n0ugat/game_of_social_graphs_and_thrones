The '''Old Way'''{{Ref|H&L202}} is a term used by the [[Ironborn]] to refer to their traditional lifestyle of [[Raiding|reaving and plundering]]. According to the Old Way, the Ironborn [[Kingsmoot|raised]] their kings from their own numbers. It is also consecrated in the Ironborn religion, as they believe the [[Drowned God]] made them to reap and rape, to carve out kingdoms to make their names known in blood and song.

The Old Way centers around the concept of "paying the [[iron price]]": to seize any wealth or possession by force. To pay the "gold price", buying or trading for items, is shameful for any man.

Another aspect of the Old Way is that Ironborn are not expected to farm (as implied by House Greyjoy's words "We Do Not Sow"), work the land, or toll in mines; such tasks are reserved for [[thrall]]s: men and women captured in raids and forced into servitude. If a woman is considered attractive, she's made into a [[salt wife]], a bound concubine.

Following the Old Way, the Ironborn carved a kingdom that came to dominate much of the western coast of [[Westeros]], going as far east as the [[Trident]] and its surrounding lands. However, when [[Aegon I Targaryen]] [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered]] Westeros, he outlawed the Old Way and restored the [[Riverlands]] to its people.

Three hundred years later, [[Balon Greyjoy]] declared himself [[King of the Iron Islands]] and [[Greyjoy Rebellion|rebelled]] against the [[Iron Throne]] in an attempt to revive the Old Way but was soundly defeated and forced to bend the knee. More than a decade later, with the [[Seven Kingdoms]] embroiled in [[War of the Five Kings|civil war]], Lord Balon once again declared himself King and revived the Old Way to [[Ironborn invasion of the North|seize the North]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, following the Old Way once led the ironborn to rule much of the western coast of Westeros, from [[Bear Island]] to the [[Arbor]], though they lost much of their territory in war against the neighboring kingdoms. Aegon the Conqueror outlawed the Old Way, forcing the ironborn to raid outside the realm - though minor attacks against the Western coast of the [[North]] were still carried out. During the rule of Aerys I Targaryen, Lord Dagon Greyjoy revived the Old Way and the ironborn raided as far south as the Arbor and even the North, as the Iron Throne was preoccupied with the [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre]] pretenders across the [[Narrow Sea]] and the Great Spring Sickness.
