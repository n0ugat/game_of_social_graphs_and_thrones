{{Quote|But his third wife couldn't give him a child either. Desperate to cement his stolen throne with an heir, Maegor took three wives at once, known as the Black Brides because each were women he'd widowed in his wars. All three women grew full with child in time, but each gave birth to the same twisted monstrosities as his second wife. One need not be a maester, much less a Grand Maester, to deduce the common thread here.|[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel (short)}}
Queen '''Elinor Costayne'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was a wife of [[Maegor Targaryen]], one of the three "[[Black Brides]]."

==Biography==
King Maegor married Elinor out of desperation for an heir, after failing to produce one with his first three wives, choosing her because she was of proven fertility. Her late husband was at some point killed by Maegor. However, she still miscarried just like the others.{{Ref|H&L806}}

==Family==
{{Targaryen tree (Aegon's Conquest)}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Elinor Costayne's husband Theo Bolling was executed, accused of conspiring with Queen Alyssa Velaryon to place Prince [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] on the [[Iron Throne]]. After seven days of mourning, she was forced to marry King Maegor.

It was Queen Elinor who found Maegor dead on the Iron Throne. Though many still believe the Throne itself killed him, some suspected she had done the deed instead, as vengeance for her first husband.

After King Maegor's death, Elinor became one of the Seven Speakers who were assigned by Jaehaerys to spread rumors all over the realm about his wife [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]]'s virtues, thus make the people accept their incestuous marriage. She later joined the Faith as a [[septa]], and ended her days as Mother of the Great Motherhouse of [[Lannisport]].
