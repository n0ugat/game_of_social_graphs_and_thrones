==Behind the scenes==
Duncan is codenamed "Soldier" in a casting call published in October 2023. The character description reads as follows:

:''"Aged 18-25. The soldier is very tall and physically strong. He has a humble disposition and is perceptive and thoughtful. Any ethnicity. Must be at least 6'4 (193cm)."''<ref name="Casting" />

==In the books==
Duncan is the main protagonist of the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], the first of which is set just under 90 years before ''A Game of Thrones''.

Beginning as a [[Flea Bottom]] street urchin named Dunk, he was taken on as squire by the hedge knight Ser Arlan of Pennytree at the age of 5 or 6. The pair traveled all over [[Westeros]] and served many high lords, including Lord Leo "Longthorn" Tyrell, Lord Florent, and Lord Dondarrion, the latter of whom they assisted in a hunt for the Vulture King. From the moment Ser Arlan first let Dunk hold a sword, he dreamt of becoming a knight of the [[Kingsguard]].

In 209 AC, Dunk and Arlan are traveling to [[Ashford]] for a [[Tournament at Ashford Meadow|tourney]]. However, Arlan dies of a chill, leaving Dunk to bury him and continue to Ashford on his own.
