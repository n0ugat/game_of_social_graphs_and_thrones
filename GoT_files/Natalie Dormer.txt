'''Natalie Dormer''' (born 11 February 1982) is an English actress who played [[Margaery Tyrell]] in ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Career==
Prior to working on ''Game of Thrones'', Dormer was best known for her role as [[wikipedia:Anne Boleyn|Anne Boleyn]] in the first two seasons of ''[[wikipedia:The Tudors (TV series)|The Tudors]]''. She has also had a recurring role as [[wikipedia:Irene Adler|Irene Adler]]/[[wikipedia:Professor Moriarty|Jamie Moriarty]] in the [[wikipedia:Sherlock Holmes|Sherlock Holmes]]-inspired series ''[[wikipedia:Elementary (TV_series)|Elementary]].'' As of 2017, Natalie also voiced Dr. Lexi T'Perro in the video game ''[[wikipedia:Mass_Effect:_Andromeda|Mass Effect: Andromeda]]'', as well as starring in the mini-series ''[[wikipedia:Picnic_At_Hanging_Rock_(TV_series)|Picnic At Hanging Rock]]''.

Natalie appeared as Cressida in the last two [[Wikipedia:The Hunger Games (film series)|''Hunger Games'' films]].

Dormer has a tattoo on her left forearm that reads: "Fear is the mind-killer".

==On ''Game of Thrones''==
In ''Game of Thrones'' Dormer is playing the role of [[Margaery Tyrell]], starting in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]]. She was announced in the role on 23 June 2011 and was the first actor to be announced for the second season of the series. She enjoyed working on the show and found the large ensemble to be very well supported.<ref>[http://www.redeyechicago.com/entertainment/tv/redeye-natalie-dormer-talks-the-fades-game-of-thrones-madonna-20120202,0,5417639.story Chatting up Natalie Dormer about 'The Fades,' 'Game of Thrones,' Madonna], ''Red Eye Chicago'' interview with Natalie Dormer, 2012 February 2.</ref> She is a new starring cast member for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]]. 

Before being cast as Margaery, Dormer auditioned for another character who was being cast for the second season, but did not get the role. She stated that she would not confirm which other role she auditioned for while the show was still being broadcast. She was subsequently offered the role of Margaery instead.<ref>https://winteriscoming.net/2014/11/10/natalie-dormer-auditioned-another-thrones-role-margaery-tyrell/</ref>

When asked if she thought Margaery was being insincere when she gave out food aid to the orphans and smallfolk of King's Landing in Season 3, Dormer said it was a mix of political pragmatism as well as legitimate concern for her subjects: "It doesn't mean she's insincere. People can be quite cruel, I find, about Margaery: 'Oh, she's another malicious, calculating character who's after the Throne.' But I don't think in regards with her attitude to the public and her attitude to Sansa – she's not disingenuous. I don't see the two as mutually exclusive, as modern politicians themselves would say. I think she has a heart. I think she can be very sincere. I just think she's a pragmatist. She's been brought up by the Queen of Thorns, Lady [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna]], being played by [[Diana Rigg]] [stay tuned!], to be a shrewd politician – to be the ideal First Lady, as it were.<ref>[http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/game-of-thrones-q-a-natalie-dormer-on-playing-the-kate-middleton-of-westeros-20130401 'Game of Thrones' Q&A: Natalie Dormer on Playing 'the Kate Middleton of Westeros'], ''Rolling Stone'', April 1st, 2013.</ref>

Dormer reprised her role as Margaery in ''[[Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series]]''
