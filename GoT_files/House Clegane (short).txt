==Narration==
'''Sandor Clegane''': ''Honor. Glory. Lies to make idiot boys want [[knighthood]], and idiot girls spread their legs for it. Let me tell you what makes a knight: killing. Either enough men, or the right man.'' 

''[[House Clegane]] should know. We're very good at both.''

''Most families claim some great ancestors so far back that nobody can prove them liars. Not us. My [[Gregor Clegane's grandfather|grandfather]] [[Kennelmaster|kept]] the kennel for Lord [[Tytos Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]], the father of Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]. Lord Tytos was a weak man who didn't know it.''

''One day while hunting, he stumbled on a lioness. Instead of embracing the man who wore her on his banners, she tried to tear out his throat. Lucky my grandfather came up with the dogs and drove the big cat away.''

''As a reward, the Cleganes got lands and [[Clegane's Keep|a keep]] and a son to squire for the Lannisters. We took the three hounds who died for them as our new sigil.''

''When Tywin Lannister became [[Lord of Casterly Rock]], he wanted more from his former kennelmaster than fealty. He bet that training hounds to kill isn't far from training boys to kill.'' 

''In just two generations, my brother [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]] and [[Sandor Clegane|I]] proved him right. I gutted my first man at twelve.''

''Years after, servants started disappearing in our keep, and even a sister I don't remember. But nobody could prove anything against Gregor or dared if they caught him at it.''

''For my father wanted a knight in our family and thought he'd found one in Gregor, who at thirteen towered over enough men that they called him "the Mountain."''

''Sure, Gregor looks quite the champion from a distance, but a mountain can't cleave a man in half in one blow, and won't break a wench's face if she talks.''

''Through Lord Tywin's influence, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] kindly anointed my brother personally. A great honor for our family, everyone said.''

''One year later, ''Ser'' Gregor chivalrously [[Sack of King's Landing|sacked]] the Prince's [[King's Landing|city]], brained the Prince's [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|baby]], and raped and murdered the Prince's [[Elia Martell|wife]], winning our family yet more ''honor'' from the [[Robert Baratheon|new king]] and [[Cersei Lannister|queen]].''

''Soon after, my father died, they say, in a hunting accident. The same day that Gregor became lord of the Clegane lands, gold, and anything under his roof, I left our home to take service at Casterly Rock. Lord Tywin is not like his father. Neither is King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] or the likes of me would never be on the [[Kingsguard]], with all those "true knights."''

''Between them, the man who serves the Lannisters will never lack for killing.''

''I'll guard this king, such as he is. Gregor will [[War of the Five Kings|kill the other ones]], such as he does. When we're done, we'll see how many people still believe in songs and fairytales.''

==Behind the scenes==
*The sentence "a mountain can't cleave a man in half in one blow, and won't break a wench's face if she talks" is perhaps a reference to the novels: in ''A Feast for Crows'', it is reported that when the Mountain was in Harrenhal, a servant girl named Pia spoke when he wanted silence, so he smashed her face in with his mailed fist, breaking her nose and many of her teeth.
*The short matches the information from the novels rather closely, about the foundation of House Clegane, the Mountain's background and foul deeds (specifically the brutal murder of Elia Martell and her children), and the Hound's cynical opinion about knighthood. A significant item has been omitted, though: the burning of the Hound's face.

==In the books==
* The short is adapted from the following chapter of ''A Game of Thrones'':
**Chapter 30, Eddard VII: [[Eddard Stark|Someone]] muses over the Mountain's dark background, including the mysterious deaths of his father, sister, and servants.

* The short is adapted from the following chapters of ''A Clash of Kings'':
**Chapter 18, Sansa II: The Hound tells how his grandfather saved [[Tytos Lannister]], the rewards he received, and the origin of his house sigil.
**Chapter 52, Sansa IV: The Hound tells that he killed his first man at twelve, and expresses his contempt about knighthood.

* The short is adapted from the following chapter of ''A Feast for Crows'':
**Chapter 27, Jaime III: It is reported that the Mountain severely harmed a woman for speaking when he wanted silence.
