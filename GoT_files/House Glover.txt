'''House Glover'''{{Ref|GOT607}} of [[Deepwood Motte]] is a [[noble house]] from the [[Wolfswood]] in the [[North]] of [[Westeros]]. They are loyal vassals of [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]], and their lands extend throughout the Wolfswood, northwest of Winterfell.

House Glover's [[heraldry]] is a silver armored fist on a scarlet red background (observed instances present it as a left-handed fist).

==Military==
It is unknown how many soldiers House Glover could raise before the War of the Five Kings. The [[Red Wedding]] and the capture of Deepwood Motte by the [[Ironborn]] (including the capture of [[Robett Glover]]'s family) significantly weakened the House. Following the Battle of the Bastards, House Glover's forces consisted of about 500 men when Robett Glover pledge his allegiance to House Stark once again.

Glover soldiers were easily distinguishable from other Northern soldiers, their helmets resembling the Stark helms that have pointed edges. Their uniforms consisted of wearing iron breastplates as well as wearing distinct black skirts.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Glover is a loyal and reliable vassal of the Starks. Before they became bannermen of House Stark, they were petty kings. Their castle is a motte-and-bailey wooden castle located inland but close to the Bay of Ice. House Glover's sigil is a mailed silver fist on scarlet background.

Other minor vassal Houses sworn to the Glovers that have not appeared in the series: House Woods, House Branch, and House Bole.

Technically, the Glovers are stated to be a "Masterly" House, not a full major noble house - which would go towards explaining why Greatjon Umber would be insulted at being commanded by a Glover. However, [[George R.R. Martin]] has admitted that he didn't really think out a full system of titles for different degrees of rank within the nobility of the Seven Kingdoms. There actually doesn't seem to be any functional difference between "Masterly" Houses, such as the Glovers and other major Houses like the Umbers. There are basically three tiers of noble family under each Great House such as the Starks: major Houses who answer only to the Great House of the region (i.e. the Umbers), minor lordly Houses who serve another intermediary noble house (House Marsh serves House Reed), and knightly Houses - unlike lords, knights do not have the power to dispense justice and executions on their own lands. Some minor lordly Houses also directly serve the Great House of the region, given that a feudal system isn't entirely a delegated hierarchy, but the ruling family gathers strength from its own lands. Thus minor Houses such as [[House Cassel|Cassel]] and [[House Poole|Poole]] also serve the Starks. At any rate, because the Glovers answer to no intermediary lords but to the Starks themselves, and local lesser Houses in turn serve as vassals to the Glovers, there really doesn't seem to be any functional difference between the titles. Apparently their "Masterly" rank as the "Masters of Deepwood Motte" has to do with being marcher lords of a sort, responsible for governing the wild regions of the Wolfswood.

During the [[ironborn]]'s invasion, [[Yara Greyjoy|Asha Greyjoy]] takes Deepwood Motte with her forces, holding Sybelle and her children as hostages. The events relating to House Glover in [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]] differs significantly from the novels. In ''A Dance of Dragons'', Deepwood Motte is taken by a combined northern and [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone|Baratheon]] army led by [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. Most of the ironborn garrison is slaughtered but Asha and nine of her followers are taken prisoner. This victory wins Stannis the support of the northern lords and allows him to muster an army to challenge the [[House Bolton|Boltons]] and their [[House Frey]] allies. By contrast, the Glovers' retaking of Deepwood Motte is only mentioned in passing in the episode "[[Home]]." In the episode "[[The Broken Man]]", Robett briefly mentions that his wife and children were thrown into prison by the ironborn.
