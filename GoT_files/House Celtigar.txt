==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the head of House Celtigar is Ardrian Celtigar, a sour old man known for his avarice and wealth. The sigil of House Celtigar is red crabs strewn on a white field. Their words do not appear in the books. Their ancestral [[Armament|weapon]] is an unnamed [[Valyrian steel]] axe. House Celtigar fights for [[Stannis Baratheon]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]], contributing the ornate ship ''Red Claw'' to Stannis's [[royal fleet]], but surrenders and swears fealty to the [[Iron Throne]] after the devastating defeat at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Lord Ardrian remains at [[King's Landing]] for the remainder of the war.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', Ser [[Axell Florent]] suggests that Stannis sack Claw Isle as a reprisal for House Celtigar's surrender, but [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] dissuades Stannis.

At the [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister]], Ardrian is one of the witnesses who testify that Tyrion once threatened [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].
