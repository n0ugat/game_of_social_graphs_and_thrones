The '''Crone'''{{Ref|GOT206}} ​is an aspect of the [[Seven]]. She represents wisdom and foresight. She is often represented as a wizened old lady carrying a lantern. A statue of her stood in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] in [[King's Landing]], next to the [[Warrior]], until it was [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|destroyed in a wildfire explosion]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Crone represents wisdom and is prayed to for guidance. Her statues often show her with a lamp in one hand, to symbolize her leading the way to wisdom and prevent people stumbling blindly in ignorance.

A passage in ''[[The Seven-Pointed Star]]'' says that the Crone foretold that the girl the [[Maiden]] brought forth would bear Hugor of the Hill four-and-forty mighty sons.

There is a constellation of stars called the Crone's Lantern.

While in a nameless village, [[Catelyn Stark]] prays in a sept that is modest and has no statues of the Seven, only rough charcoal drawings to represent them. She turns to the Crone and prays ''“Guide me, wise lady. Show me the path I must walk, and do not let me stumble in the dark places that lie ahead.”''
