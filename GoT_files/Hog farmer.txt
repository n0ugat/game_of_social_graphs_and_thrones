{{Quote|Thanks very much.|The farmer before he is knocked out by the Hound.|The Rains of Castamere (episode)}}
The '''hog farmer''' is a commoner whom [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] encounter on their way to [[Red Wedding|Edmure's wedding]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The hog farmer is working on a broken wagon wheel when the Hound and Arya approach. He mentions he has had 3 spokes broken this day and needs to get the pork to the [[Twins]] for the wedding. The Hound offers him a hand, but instead hits him unconscious. The Hound is about to kill the man, but Arya intervenes and talks him out of it. As the farmer regains consciousness, Arya herself knocks him out again.{{Ref|GOT309}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Arya and the Hound meet the farmer on the kingsroad. The cart is not broken, and the farmer does not need help to fix it.

The Hound forces the farmer at swordpoint to give his cart, horses, casks and most of his clothes, but does not intend to kill him. Arya does not intervene. The farmer reluctantly complies, and curses the Hound for a robber. The Hound answers "No, a forager. Be grateful you get to keep your smallclothes. Now take those boots off. Or I'll take your legs off. Your choice". The farmer is as big as the Hound, but wisely chooses to give up his boots and keep his legs. Then Arya and the Hound continue their journey to the Twins, leaving the farmer behind.

Neither the Hound nor Arya knocks the farmer unconscious or otherwise physically harms him.
