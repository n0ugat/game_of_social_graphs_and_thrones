Ser '''Willem Wylde'''{{Con|D&EN}} is a member of the [[Kingsguard]] of [[Daeron II Targaryen]].{{Ref|H&L416}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Willem Wylde was a member of the Kingsguard during the reign of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] Daeron II Targaryen. When a place opened in the Kingsguard, Daeron gave the position to Ser Willem. Daeron either did not know or willfully ignored his father [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]]'s promise to Ser Quentyn Ball that he would be raised to the Kingsguard. This was one of the contributing factors to Ser Quentyn siding with [[Daemon Blackfyre]] during the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].
