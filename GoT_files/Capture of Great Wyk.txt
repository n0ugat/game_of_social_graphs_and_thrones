During the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], [[Great Wyk]] was '''captured''' by [[Stannis Baratheon]].

==History==
Following the destruction of the [[Iron Fleet]] at a [[sea battle off Fair Isle]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] led the [[royal fleet]] in a counterattack and subdued [[Great Wyk]], the largest of the [[Iron Islands]], while [[Assault on Old Wyk|Old Wyk fell]] to Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]. 

These two victories paved the way for the subsequent [[Siege of Pyke]], which spelled the end of the [[ironborn]] rebellion.<ref>"[[Greyjoy Rebellion - Stannis Baratheon]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, while Barristan Selmy besieged Old Wyk, Stannis led an assault on Great Wyk during the Greyjoy Rebellion.
