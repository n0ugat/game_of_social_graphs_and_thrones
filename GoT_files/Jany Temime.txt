==Career==
Temime grew up in Paris, France, and attended the Paris Nanterre University. Her first job was as a fashion journalist for lifestyle magazine ''Elle'', but later moved to the Netherlands to pursue a career in the film industry.

She later moved to London to take over as costumer designer on the ''Harry Potter'' franchise, starting with the third film in the series, ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. Her arrival was something of a paradigm shift, putting a renewed emphasis on characters wearing realistic and relatable clothing compared to the first two films.

Temime worked as costume designer on all of the subsequent main sequence ''Harry Potter'' films, six in all. Given her long tenure on the franchise, she also had to deal with planning out character arcs through clothing, for child cast members who would age over the years. With the main series completed, Temime declined to return for any ''Harry Potter'' prequel projects, feeling her work with the franchise was complete with the conclusion of the main series.

''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' (2003) was directed by Alfonso Cuarón, and while he departed that franchise, it was the first of multiple collaborations between him and Temime. She went on to work as costume designer on Cuarón's critically acclaimed dytopian film ''Children of Men'' (2006), alongside production designer [[Jim Clay]] (who would also later join ''House of the Dragon''). Temime later worked on Cuarón's 2013 film ''Gravity'', designing realistic astronaut space-suits.

Afterwards, Temime moved on to another major franchise, the ''James Bond'' series, on which she was lead costume designer for ''Skyfall'' (2012) and ''Specture'' (2015) (the third and fourth films starring Daniel Craig in the title role). Once again, Temime's arrival introduced a paradigm shift, emphasizing realism. Temime strove to reinvent the "Bond girl" look so that their outfits were more pragmatic. Temime stressed that she wasn't opposed to outfits looking "sexy", but she wanted them to be functional enough that the actresses could actually move, run, shoot, etc., instead of restrictive or elaborate outfits that prevented this.

Temime won the Costume Designers Guild Award in 2012 for ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2'', and again in 2013 for ''Skyfall''. More recently in 2020 her work on the Judy Garland biopic ''Judy'' was nominated for a BAFTA Award and a British Independent Film Award.
