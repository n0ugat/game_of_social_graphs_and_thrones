{{Quote|The key to Varys is that he's one way in public, when he's working, very fey, giggly, and effete for want of a better word, but there are moments when he drops all that and speaks honestly. That stuff is great to play. When Ned asks Varys who he truly serves, and Varys answers, "The realm," I think that's true. There's a moral code there... He sees in Tyrion someone who plays the game well, and Varys loves playing the game. Ned was too honorable and too good - he disdained the game.|Conleth Hill on playing Varys|Inside HBO's Game of Thrones}}
'''Conleth Seamus Eoin Croiston Hill''' (born 24 November 1964) is a Northern Irish film, stage and television actor. His career has been focused on stage work, where he has been twice nominated for the Tony Award and has won the Laurence Olivier. He recently appeared in the film [[wikipedia:Whatever Works|''Whatever Works'']] with [[wikipedia:Larry David|Larry David]], directed by [[wikipedia:Woody Allen|Woody Allen]], and was a regular on the [[wikipedia:Jennifer Saunders|Jennifer Saunders]] comedy series [[wikipedia:The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle|''The Life and Times of Vivienne Vyle'']].

==''Game of Thrones''==
In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', Hill is playing the role of [[Varys]]. He was confirmed in the role on 15 July 2010. He initially appeared as a guest star in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|first season]] and joined the starring cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]]. He also voices the character of Varys in the ''Game of Thrones'' role-playing [[Game of Thrones (game)|game]].

Conleth Hill originally auditioned for the role of King [[Robert Baratheon]] before being cast as Varys.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/39270/game-of-thrones-season-5-what-we-learned-from-the-blu-rays Season 5 Blu-ray commentary]</ref>

[[George R.R. Martin]] has repeatedly praised Hill's performance as Varys, citing him as one of the actors who comes the closest to exactly how he mentally pictured a character in the novels. As Martin explained, he had his own image of the characters and their mannerisms in his head for nearly 20 years before the live-action series began, and while he certainly ''enjoys'' the performance of many actors (even Sean Bean as Ned Stark), few of them come close to exactly how he pictured them acting in his mind.
