==Production==
On March 28, 2023, ''Deadline'' revealed that the [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|second season]] of ''House of the Dragon'' would consist of eight episodes, rather than the previously reported ten. Due to this, portions of the plot originally intended for the second season, including a major battle, had been moved to the third season, which was actively being considered for a greenlight by [[HBO]] as the second season was approaching its production period.{{Webref|name=Deadline |author=Nellie Andreeva |date=March 28, 2023 |url=https://deadline.com/2023/03/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-count-season-3-greenlight-season-4-hbo-1235312044/ |title=‘House Of The Dragon’ To Get Shorter Season 2 As HBO Series Eyes Season 3 Greenlight |website=Deadline |access-date=December 7, 2023 }}

On December 6, 2023, George R.R. Martin revealed that he, Ryan Condal, and the writing staff (Sara Hess, [[Ti Mikkel]], [[David Hancock]], and [[Philippa Goslett]]) had discussed and worked on the third and [[House of the Dragon: Season 4|fourth seasons]] of ''House of the Dragon''.<ref name="NAB" />

On January 3, 2024, ''Redanian Intelligence'' reported that active scriptwriting and other early aspects of development were set to begin that month.{{Webref|name=Redanian |author=Gravemaster |date=January 3, 2024 |url=https://redanianintelligence.com/2024/01/03/house-of-the-dragon-season-3-start-active-development/ |title=House of the Dragon Season 3 Starts Active Development |website=Redanian Intelligence |access-date=January 4, 2024 }}

Filming began on March 31, 2025,<ref name="Production" />, with production being divided between the blood unit, working on exterior scenes and the fire unit at Leavesden Studios. Production returned to Wales in June 2025, with Dinorwig Quarry, Newborough Forest, Penmon, Cwm Idwal, Gwynedd lake, Union Rock at Llanberis, Conwy, Capel Curig, Nant Peris and Twyni Penrhos as filming locations. Following that, production moved to Hankley Common, Surrey, for an extensive two-month shooting schedule at seven locations in the area. A deal is in place with the Spanish town of Caceras to return for filming later in 2025.{{Webref|name=Caceres |author=María José Torrejón |date=June 28, 2024 |url=https://www.hoy.es/caceres/hbo-inicia-contactos-regresar-caceres-partir-proximo-20240628143016-nt.html |title=HBO inicia los contactos para regresar a Cáceres a partir del próximo otoño |website=HOY |access-date=June 30, 2024 }}
