'''Execution'''{{Ref|GOT306}} is the punishment of a crime through death. It is often performed in public as a means of enforcing authority or demoralizing political dissent, particularly in times of political instability.

Noblemen are often executed by beheading - which is considered to be more quick and humane than a comparatively slow death by hanging, which is normally meted out to lowborn criminals (and thus it is considered more humiliating for a nobleman to be hanged), or crucifixion.

==Execution customs==
*The [[North]]: Sentences are usually carried out by the lords themselves, holding to the tenet of the [[First Men]] that "he who passes the sentence should swing the sword" (perhaps the purpose of this rule is that the lords should not be too hasty in issuing death sentences). In cases where the death sentence applies to a large group of people, hanging or other methods may be carried out by the lord's retainers.
**Historically, members of [[House Bolton]] executed their victims through torture, mutilation and [[flaying]]. They seemingly gave up the practice after [[bending the knee|pledging fealty]] to House Stark but supposedly continued it in secret until the rise of Ramsay Bolton.
*The "South": Sentences are usually carried out by headsmen or torturers. In the case of the [[King's Landing]] itself, sentences are carried out by the [[King's Justice]], a royal executioner.
**In the [[Eyrie]], executions are not carried out by headsmen, instead the Moon Door is used to drop criminals below the arch of the mountain atop of which the castle was built.
**In the [[Iron Islands]], criminals who have attempted to kill a major lord can be punished by being tied down on the beach at low tide, then leaving them there to slowly drown, watching for hours as death creeps closer to them one inch at a time.

==Crimes punished through execution==
Even though there are no laws that actually limit execution, there are a number of crimes that are stated to result in execution:
*[[Desertion]]
*[[Treason]]
*Murder
*[[Regicide]]

Execution may be avoided if the culprit chooses to join the Night's Watch. In the case of members of the Night's Watch, the punishment for these crimes is death, particularly in cases of desertion.

:[[George R.R. Martin]] has stated that if a woman commits a crime punishable by death, because women cannot join the Night's Watch, the woman is usually given the choice to join the monastic order of the [[Silent Sisters]] instead.
