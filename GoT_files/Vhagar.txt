'''Vhagar''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Vagar''}}{{Note|<small>VĀ</small>-gär}} called the '''Queen of All Dragons''',{{Guideref|Vhagar}} is the [[dragon]] who was ridden by [[Visenya Targaryen]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]].{{Ref|GOT104}}{{Ref|GOT207}} Although during this time she was the smallest of the trio that included [[Balerion]] and [[Meraxes]], Vhagar was still large enough to swallow a horse whole, and her flames could melt armor.{{Ref|H&L109}}{{Ref|GOT308}} A hundred years later, during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen]], she is the largest of all known living dragons and the last remaining dragon from the days of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]]'s conquest.

==Biography==
===Background===
Vhagar, named after one of the gods of [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]], was flown by Aegon's sister-wife Visenya during Aegon's Conquest. She was one of the three dragons present at the [[Field of Fire]], the decisive battle of the conquest that ensured Targaryen mastery of the Seven Kingdoms. She has deep jade-green scales and orange eyes.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

[[File:Visenya takes the Eyrie.jpg|thumb|250px|Vhagar casts her shadow over the Eyrie.]] 
Nonetheless, [[House Arryn]] thought that the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] could still resist Targaryen domination by hiding behind the impregnable [[Mountains of the Moon]] along their borders, and fortifying the [[Eastern Road|mountain passes]] beyond any hope of attack. Similar to how Aegon [[Burning of Harrenhal|had dealt with Harrenhal]], Visenya simply flew Vhagar directly over the mountains, and came to rest in the courtyard of the Arryn's own castle, the [[Eyrie]]. At the time, the [[King of the Mountain and the Vale]] was only a small boy, [[Ronnel Arryn]], whose mother [[Sharra Arryn|Sharra]] was acting as his [[Regent|regent]]. Visenya did not need to burn the Eyrie as Aegon had burned Harrenhal: her display of force with Vhagar and easily befriending Ronnel was enough to convince the Arryns to surrender. Young Ronnel did ask one condition for his surrender: in return, Visenya would give him a ride around the Eyrie atop her dragon. The Vale surrendered, and true to her word, Visenya gave Ronnel a ride atop Vhagar, flying around the summit of the Eyrie three times before they landed.{{Ref|H&L316}}

Following the death of Balerion sometime before the accession of [[Viserys I Targaryen]] to the Iron Throne, Vhagar remained the last of the three dragons who had come to Westeros with the Targaryens.{{Ref|HOTD101}} She eventually became the mount of Prince [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon Targaryen]] until his death.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Queen [[Aemma Arryn]] tells her husband, King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]], that their daughter [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] has picked a dragon egg that reminds her of Vhagar for her unborn sibling, who she hopes will be a girl named Visenya.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

[[File:Vhagar Official Guide.jpg|thumb|250px|Vhagar in Pentos.]]In conversation with Lady [[Laena Velaryon]], Viserys tells her that Vhagar has not been seen for some time, but that the [[Dragonkeepers]] believed she had made her nest along the coast of the [[Narrow Sea]]. By this time, Vhagar's size was such that she was too large to remain in the [[Dragonpit]]. Laena says that traders in [[Spicetown]] on her native [[Driftmark]] claim to hear her song at times, and that it sounds sad. Viserys muses that even dragons can get lonely.{{Ref|HOTD102}}

More than a decade later, Vhagar is the mount of Laena herself. Laena takes great pride in riding the largest known living dragon in the world, riding alongside her husband [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] and his own dragon [[Caraxes]]. Sometime later, Laena suffers a difficult birth, with everyone believing the child must be cut out of her to survive. Unwilling to die in bed, she stumbles outside to find Vhagar, before giving the command "Dracarys." Vhagar hesitates, unwilling to burn her rider despite her repeated pained commands. Eventually, she complies and unleashes her dragonfire, incinerating Laena to prevent a more drawn out and painful death.{{Ref|HOTD106}}
[[File:House-of-the-Dragon-Dragonstone.png|thumb|Vhagar, Dreamfyre and Sunfyre leave Driftmark.]]
Days later, as she sleeps on the beach of [[High Tide]], Vhagar is awakened by [[Aemond Targaryen]], who desires to ride a dragon. She initially ignores his attempt to mount her and goes back to sleep, but when Aemond tries again, Vhagar nearly unleashes her dragonfire on him but is successfully commanded by Aemond in [[High Valyrian]]. Having now claimed and bonded with her, Aemond takes her for a first flight; though he nearly falls to his death having not properly fastened himself to the saddle, he is able to fly her around Driftmark. Later, during the royal family's return to [[King's Landing]], Aemond rides Vhagar home.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

[[File:Vhagar kills Arrax.png|thumb|250px|Vhagar kills [[Arrax]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]].]]
Aemond rides Vhagar to [[Storm's End]] to treat with and gain the support of [[Lord of Storm's End|Lord]] [[Borros Baratheon]] for Aegon. She notices the arrival of [[Lucerys Velaryon]] and [[Arrax]]. After Lucerys and Arrax leave, Aemond [[Fight above Shipbreaker Bay|pursues]] on Vhagar to scare him and take one of his eyes as revenge for losing his own shortly after he claimed Vhagar. After nearly snatching him several times, she loses track of Arrax when the small dragon flies into a ravine, far too narrow for her to follow. But Arrax, against Luke's wishes, turns around and blasts Vhagar with dragonflame. Enraged, Vhagar pursues, ignoring Aemond as he desperately tries to regain control of her. Above the storm, Vhagar catches Arrax in her mouth, even as Aemond commands her to stop her attack. Being about five times larger than the younger dragon, she easily rips him apart with a single bite, sending his and Lucerys's corpses plummeting to the ground below.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Vhagar and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] return to the [[Red Keep]] as the people of [[King's Landing]] prepare the city's defenses.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

[[File:S2 Vhagar 2.png|thumb|250px|Vhagar chasing [[Silverwing]] to [[Dragonstone]].]]Vhagar and Aemond are waiting for Ser [[Criston Cole]]'s signal to [[Battle at Rook's Rest|attack]] [[Rook's Rest]] when they see [[Sunfyre]] and [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] flying above them. Vhagar and Aemond wait until Sunfyre and [[Meleys]] are wounded before they fly into the battlefield. Vhagar blasts Sunfyre and Meleys with her fire breath, which results in Sunfyre crashing into a nearby forest, badly burned. Vhagar and Meleys breathe fire and lock claws with each other before Meleys slashes Vhagar's underbelly. Vhagar and Meleys spiral through the air before she eventually crashes into the earth and inadvertently kills numerous [[Greens]]. However, she recovers swiftly and ambushes Meleys and [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] by hiding behind the castle and the cliffs below. As they ascend higher, Vhagar clamps her jaws around Meleys's neck, killing her with a crushing bite. Vhagar then releases Meleys's body, causing the smaller dragon to plummet and crash onto the walls of Rook's Rest in a fiery explosion.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Vhagar is resting outside of King's Landing before Aemond rides her to pursue [[Silverwing]] and [[Ulf]]. But upon seeing Silverwing roaring alongside [[Vermithor]] and [[Syrax]] on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], Aemond commands Vhagar to fly back to King's Landing.{{Ref|HOTD207}}
[[File:Vhagar at Sharp Point..png|thumb|Vhagar and Aemond after Sharp Point.]]
Aemond commands Vhagar to [[Burning of Sharp Point|burn]] the castle of [[Sharp Point]] in retaliation for Rhaenyra finding three new [[dragonrider]]s.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Quotes==
===Spoken about Vhagar===
{{Quote|What that rogue Aemond has done, in winning Vhagar to our side. The boy was right. It's worth a thousand times the price he paid.|[[Otto Hightower]]|Driftmark (episode)}}
{{Quote|Vhagar was five times the size of Arrax and the hardened survivor of a hundred battles.|[[Robert Baratheon]]|The Dance of Dragons}}

==In the books==
Visenya continued to ride Vhagar to war during the [[Faith Militant uprising]], burning out rebel castles in the [[Riverlands]] as once she had burned out castles in Dorne (even though Visenya was over 70 years old at the time). Visenya eventually died late in Maegor's reign: her riders during the next 60 or so years, if any, are unknown.

Vhagar remained riderless for many years following Visenya's death, lairing first in the yards of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] and later in the [[Dragonpit]] of [[King's Landing]]. It was during the reign of King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]], when his and Good Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]]'s children produced an abundance of Targaryens to claim the remaining dragons, that Vhagar finally gained a new rider in the King's second son, Prince [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]]. Baelon would ride Vhagar into battle during the Fourth Dornish War, alongside his father (astride [[Vermithor]]) and his elder brother Prince Aemon (astride [[Caraxes]]). Later, after Aemon was killed on [[Tarth]] by Myrish pirates, Baelon exacted a terrible vengeance for his beloved brother's death by unleashing Vhagar's fury on them. Baelon was made the Prince of Dragonstone and the Hand of the King for his exploits during the war on Tarth, but died several years later of a burst belly, leaving Vhagar riderless yet again. Later during the Old King's reign, Balerion died of old age, making Vhagar the oldest and largest of the Targaryen dragons.

After Meraxes and then Balerion died, Vhagar was the last of the original three Targaryen dragons. Meraxes died fighting in [[Dorne]], while Balerion later died of old age. Vhagar was the mother of several of the second-generation Targaryen dragons, but exactly which ones have not yet been specified

Vhagar fought in more major Westerosi wars than any other Targaryen dragon: Aegon's Conquest, the Faith Militant uprising, and the Dance of the Dragons. Meraxes only fought in Aegon's Conquest. Balerion did fight in the Faith Militant uprising (ridden by Visenya's own son Maegor after Aegon died), but he died before the Dance of the Dragons - though Balerion did fight in previous wars outside of Westeros, such as the "[[Century of Blood]]" in the Free Cities.

Despite being one of the more famous dragons in the story, mentioned since the first novel, Vhagar's coloration went unrevealed for 25 years. Of the three original Targaryen dragons, Balerion was stated to be black with red highlights, while Meraxes's color (silver) wasn't revealed until ''The World of Ice and Fire'' was published in 2014. This became a point of contention among fans, repeatedly pressing George R.R. Martin about it in Q&A, but he would only respond that he hadn't decided yet and kept putting it off. Vhagar's color was finally revealed in the official 2021 ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' calendar: artist Sam Hogg had to make an illustration of Vhagar, and asked for direct clarification from Martin's team, who responded that Vhagar was "bronze, with greenish blue highlights, and green eyes".<ref>[https://twitter.com/Zephyri/status/1350400252914884608 Artist Sam Hogg on Vhagar color], January 16, 2021</ref>

In homage to Vhagar, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] renames one of the ships [[Illyrio Mopatis]] sent her after her.{{Bookref|ACOK|63}}
