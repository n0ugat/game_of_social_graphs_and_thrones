Prince '''Daeron Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Dāeron Targārien''}} is a [[prince]] of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]] and the fourth child of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and Queen [[Alicent Hightower]].<ref name="NotABlog">[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/10/11/random-musings/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter Not A Blog: October 11, 2022]</ref> He rides the [[dragon]] [[Tessarion]].{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Daeron is the fourthborn child and third son of King Viserys by his second wife, Queen Alicent. He is the younger half-brother of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] through his father's first wife, the late Queen [[Aemma Arryn]], and the younger full brother of Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], Princess [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]], and Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] through his mother. He is a [[ward]] of [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|House Hightower]] in [[Oldtown]],<ref name="NotABlog" /> first being fostered by Lord [[Hobert Hightower]], and then by Hobert's son, Lord [[Ormund Hightower|Ormund]].<ref>[https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-finale-explained-aemond-luke-rhaenrya-daemon-season-2-1235412136/ Ryan Condal interview with Variety]</ref>

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Daeron was born in [[116 AC]].{{Dateref|Daeron Targaryen}} By [[126 AC]], he has bonded with his dragon, [[Tessarion]],{{Note|In "[[The Princess and the Queen]]," Aegon states that Aemond is the only one of them without a dragon; therefore, Daeron must have bonded with Tessarion by 126 AC.}} and become the ward of his great-uncle Hobert and his son, Ormund.<ref>[https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-finale-explained-aemond-luke-rhaenrya-daemon-season-2-1235412136/ Ryan Condal interview with Variety]</ref>

He is indirectly mentioned by [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] as he counts four dragons on the side of the Greens.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
After [[Otto Hightower]] is dismissed from his position as [[Hand of the King]], he tells Alicent that he plans to return to Oldtown in hopes that his grandson Daeron "takes more kindly to instructions" and can aid the Greens in the weeks to come.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

At a meeting of the [[Green Council]], Lord [[Jasper Wylde]] counsels Aegon to unleash Daeron and his dragon Tessarion from Oldtown, in order to bring the [[Riverlands]] to heel.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Before [[Gwayne Hightower|Gwayne]] departs with [[Criston Cole]] to the Riverlands, Alicent asks him how her son is doing and what he is like, for Daeron has been writing letters less frequently. Gwayne describes Daeron as a stalwart and clever sixteen year old, who is adept at playing the lute as well as wielding a sword. He further assures Alicent that Daeron is kind.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Daeron accompanies the Hightower army as it marches, riding above the host on his dragon Tessarion.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Personality==
According to his uncle, Daeron is kind, clever, and stalwart. He is adept at playing the lute as well as wielding a sword.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==Behind the scenes==
While Daeron does exist in the TV series, he does not appear in the [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|first season]] due to time constraints.<ref name="NotABlog" /> He is included in the [[Opening credits (House of the Dragon: Season 1)|opening credits]] and [[House of the Dragon Official Guide|Official Guide]], however, and [[George R.R. Martin]] has confirmed he exists in the TV continuity: as in the books, he was sent away to Oldtown to serve as a squire to his cousins in House Hightower.

Daeron was mentioned in an earlier draft of the script for "[[Driftmark (episode)|Driftmark]]," in which [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] inquires about his younger brother to [[Otto Hightower|Otto]].{{Webref|name=Driftmark |author=@darksvster |date=March 11, 2024 |url=https://twitter.com/darksvster/status/1767143440914039151 |title=Missing Scene From the House of the Dragon Script |website=𝕏 |access-date=March 11, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Daeron was the third son of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Viserys I Targaryen]], and the brother of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] and Aemond Targaryen.

When he was twelve, he was sent to serve as a [[cupbearer]] and [[squire]] to [[Hobert Hightower|Lord Hightower]] in Oldtown. Daeron was born slightly after Rhaenyra's eldest son [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]], in the same year.

By all accounts, he was a handsome, charming, and courteous young man. He grew up in the shadow of his brothers, and did not receive the constant pressure that Alicent put on her older sons that the Iron Throne should go to them instead of Rhaenyra. As a result, he was considered the gentlest and most honorable of Alicent's sons, though it is said he shared Aegon and Aemond's resentment towards Rhaenyra and her sons.
