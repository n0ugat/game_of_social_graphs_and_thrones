{{Quote|The Rock is thrice the height of the Hightower in Oldtown, taller still than the Wall in the north. It's been said that if one were to stand in the tower, on a perfect day, one could see clear across the Sunset Sea.|Jason Lannister|Second of His Name}}
'''Casterly Rock''',{{Ref|GOT101}} also known simply as the '''Rock''',{{Ref|GOT401}} is the ancestral stronghold of [[House Lannister]]. It is located on the western coast of [[Westeros]] on a rocky promontory overlooking the [[Sunset Sea]]. It overlooks the major city of [[Lannisport]]. A major goldmine is located under Casterly Rock. It is one of the most productive mines in the realm and provides House Lannister with their wealth.{{Ref|H&L123}}

==History==
===Background===
[[File:LannTheClever.png|thumb|right|Lann the Clever swindled Casterly Rock from House Casterly.]]
Casterly Rock began as a ringfort built by [[Corlos]], the founder of the eponymous [[House Casterly]]. The Casterlys ruled the Rock for centuries until it was swindled from them by [[Lann the Clever]], the founder of House Lannister.{{Ref|H&L703}}

During [[Jason Lannister]]'s lordship, the only structure atop Casterly Rock was a lone watchtower, the rest of the stronghold being within the promontory itself.{{Ref|HOTD103}} [[Tywin Lannister]] greatly expanded the exterior to a full castle.{{Ref|GOT703}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Jason Lannister boasts of Casterly Rock in an attempt to win [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s affections. He claims that it is thrice the height of the [[Hightower]] and even taller than the [[Wall]]. He also claims that if one were to stand in the watchtower on a perfect day, one could see clear across the Sunset Sea. He offers to build a [[dragon]]pit at Casterly Rock for Rhaenyra if they are wed. Jason later gifts [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys I]] a hunting spear forged in the Golden Gallery.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] reminds [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] that when they were seven years old, he jumped off the cliffs at Casterly Rock.{{Ref|GOT101}}

In [[Winterfell]], Jaime learns [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is visiting the [[Wall]] before returning to [[King's Landing]], and jokingly asks him if he is [[Night's Watch|taking the black]]. Tyrion claims that, were he to go celibate, the whores would go begging from [[Dorne]] to Casterly Rock, and explains he simply wants to visit the Wall. Later, on the way to the Wall, Tyrion talks to [[Jon Snow]] and explains that, as a dwarf, the only reason he wasn't left to die as a baby was because he wasn't born a peasant but a [[House Lannister|Lannister]] of Casterly Rock.{{Ref|GOT102}}

Following [[Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel|a bloody brawl between Jaime and Eddard]], [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] tries to convince [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to retaliate by marching against Casterly Rock, where Jaime Lannister escaped to after the fight. However, Robb refuses. 

Eddard receives a report that [[Gregor Clegane]] has been scouring the [[Riverlands]]. Figuring that the Mountain acts at [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s orders, he pronounces Clegane a criminal and instructs [[Pycelle]] to send a raven to Casterly Rock and inform Tywin that he must come to King's Landing and answer for Clegane's crimes within a fortnight, otherwise he will be branded a traitor and enemy of the Crown.{{Ref|GOT106}}

Tyrion introduces Tywin to the [[Hill tribes]] he recruited as ''"My Lord Father, Tywin son of [[Tytos Lannister|Tytos]] of house Lannister, Lord of Casterly Rock and [[Warden of the West]]."'' Likewise, in King's Landing Tywin is named Hand of the King and described as Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West.{{Ref|GOT108}}

After Jaime is taken prisoner by Robb in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]], the Lannister bannermen hold a strategy meeting and [[Leo Lefford]] suggests they can't march on the [[House Stark|Starks]] at once — they must first return to Casterly Rock and raise levies.{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Theon tries to convince his father [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] that, if they pledge fealty to Robb Stark and fight for the Starks in the [[War of the Five Kings|war]], the [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]] will be given Casterly Rock as a reward once the war is over. Balon refuses, as he claims the Greyjoys are not subject to anyone and take what is theirs.{{Ref|GOT203}}

As a captive of [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], Jaime insists on knowing his captor's identity, and to encourage her he introduces himself first as ''"Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock, son of Tywin."'' In [[Harrenhal]], Tywin's bannermen discuss whether to march against Robb or [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], and Tywin notes that Robb is too close to Casterly Rock, but his brother [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] argues that, since the Greyjoys' [[capture of Winterfell]] has divided Stark's forces, Robb won't risk marching on Casterly Rock until he is at full force. In King's Landing, Tyrion tells [[Varys]] that he never expected to have any real power — while his brother became the youngest [[Kingsguard]] in history and his sister became queen at nineteen, Tyrion was merely put in charge of the drains and cisterns of Casterly Rock.{{Ref|GOT208}}

During the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Cersei tells [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] that she never understood why Jaime and she were treated differently: while Jaime was heir to Casterly Rock, she was ''"sold to [[Robert Baratheon|some stranger]] like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired."''{{Ref|GOT209}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
After the Battle of the Blackwater, Cersei interrogates Tyrion about what he intends to tell Tywin, claiming she is worried because he slandered her to their father before: as children in Casterly Rock, Cersei had the guards beat a servant girl and Tyrion told on her. Tyrion asks Tywin to give him Casterly Rock, which is his by right since the day Jaime became a Kingsguard, as the brotherhood cannot inherit. However, Tywin coldly refuses his request, telling him that he would let himself ''"be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock"'', arguing Tyrion would turn it into his whorehouse.{{Ref|GOT301}}

In [[Riverrun]], [[Brynden Tully]] chastises [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] for talking to Robb proudly about his [[Battle of the Fords|blunder at the Stone Mill]], yet Edmure argues his actions made Gregor Clegane flee to Casterly Rock.{{Ref|GOT303}}

Robb realizes that, while he can't force the Lannisters to meet them in the field and they can't attack them at King's Landing where they are strongest, he can attack them at Casterly Rock.{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] tries to convince Sansa that her arranged marriage to Tyrion may not be so bad, as he is far from the worst Lannister and their son together would eventually become Lord of Casterly Rock and the [[North]] both. Tyrion gifts his lover [[Shae]] golden chains of solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport, smithed in Casterly Rock. However, Shae is angry at his betrothal to Sansa, and tries to convince him to go with her across the [[Narrow Sea]]. Tyrion refuses, as he is ''"a Lannister of Casterly Rock."''{{Ref|GOT307}}

At Tyrion and Sansa's wedding, Cersei intimidates Margaery by telling them the story behind the famous song of "[[The Rains of Castamere]]:" Lord [[House Reyne|Reyne]] built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock, gave his wife diamonds larger than any [[Joanna Lannister]] ever wore and finally he rebelled against Tywin, for which he and his whole House were absolutely slaughtered. Cersei tells Margaery that she remembers seeing the bodies of the Reyne's hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock.{{Ref|GOT308}}

Robb consults with his mother about his plan to attack Casterly Rock. He explains that if they take Tywin's castle from him, the lords of Westeros will realize he is not invincible. Catelyn says "show them how it feels to lose what they love."{{Ref|GOT309}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[file:Unsullied-Casterly-Rock.jpg|thumb|The [[Unsullied]] take Casterly Rock.]]
At [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s [[Small Council|war council]] at [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], Tyrion proposes that the [[Unsullied]] seize Casterly Rock, rather than put pressure on [[King's Landing]], where they will likely be viewed as a foreign force against whom the native Westerosi lords could unite.{{Ref|GOT702}}

The Unsullied eventually arrive at Casterly Rock and take the fortress by using a tunnel in the sewers which Tyrion created when he was overseeing their creation in the past. However, the Unsullied find the fortress severely undermanned as most of the 10,000 men strong Lannister garrison has left the castle and are headed towards [[Highgarden]]. Jaime later confirms to [[Olenna Tyrell]] that they have deliberately left Casterly Rock to fall into Daenerys's hands. He claims the castle was not of much use for them at the moment and is positive that Daenerys will not hold the Rock for long.{{Ref|GOT703}} Lannister is proven correct when the Unsullied present themselves along with the rest of Daenerys's forces at King's Landing for the [[Dragonpit Summit|summit]] with Cersei.{{Ref|GOT707}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Casterly Rock is one of the most formidable and well-defended castles in all of [[Westeros]]. It is located on the west coast of the continent, just north of the city of Lannisport, and is built into an immense rock formation which bears a passing resemblance to a lion in repose. According to legends, it has never fallen in battle.
[[File:Casterly Rock 2.png|thumb|Casterly Rock surface.]]
The castle consists of fortifications built into and on top of the Rock, but the most splendid parts are actually located within the Rock itself, ''beneath'' the visible castle. Additional catacombs, dungeons and redoubts are built deep into the bowels of the formation, since Casterly Rock is also the Lannisters' primary mine – this is in fact the reason for all the semi-subterranean construction, as mines were converted into parts of the castle as their wealth was extracted. Casterly Rock's main entrance is the heavily-defended Lion's Mouth. In the series, it is portrayed as a sumptuous castle sprawling across a promontory; ironically, this makes it a little closer to the books' depiction of [[Highgarden]], which is noted to have its main keep on a hill with grounds and walls sprawling in around it.
