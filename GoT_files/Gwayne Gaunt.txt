Ser '''Gwayne Gaunt''' was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Gaunt]] and sworn brother of the [[Kingsguard]] of [[Aerys II Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Gwayne was the thirdborn son of Lord [[Symon Gaunt]].

He won the [[Tournament|Tourney]] of [[Brightwater Keep]], where he crowned Lady [[Alys Reyne]] as [[queen of love and beauty]]. At a tourney of [[Bitterbridge]], he unmasked a [[mystery knight]], revealing him as Ser [[Harlan Grandison]] of the [[Kingsguard]].

He was appointed to the Kingsguard in his 20th year by [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. Later, he hunted and killed the [[Bandit Lords of the Marches]], freeing Lady and Lord [[House Dondarrion|Dondarrion]] from the [[Diamond Cave]].

Gwayne broke the [[siege of White Harbor]] by the [[Sea Kings]], rescuing Lord [[Rickard Stark]] from drowning in the process.

He once defended a lady from the advances of Lord [[Steffon Baratheon]], though he did not escalate the situation on account of Steffon's drunkenness.{{Ref|GOT806}}

Ser Gwayne died during the [[Defiance of Duskendale]], being killed by Ser [[Symon Hollard]].<ref>http://wicnet.tumblr.com/post/84156684971/the-kingsguard-armor-and-the-book-of-brothers</ref>
