==Narration==
'''Viserys Targaryen''': ''The [[Battle of the Trident]] may have been an important victory for the [[Robert Baratheon|Usurper]], but it was the treachery and barbarism of [[Tywin Lannister]] that sealed the fate of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]].''

''My father, King Aerys, had ever been a friend to the [[House Lannister|Lions]] of the [[Casterly Rock|Rock]]. Aerys graciously brought Tywin to court, making him the youngest [[Hand of the King]] in history. He gave him power. He gave him respect. He made it possible for Tywin to restore House Lannister to glory. Aerys and Tywin governed side by side for twenty prosperous years.''

''Still, when the Usurper called his banners in [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]], Tywin Lannister ignored his king's pleas for help, and stayed holed up in his stronghold of Casterly Rock. In time, my brother Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] was dead. The realm was in turmoil. And the Usurper's forces were said to be riding for [[King's Landing]].''

''What a glorious sight it must have been when a force of ten thousand Lannister men showed up at the gate of the capital with Lord Tywin at their head, pledging support to his beleaguered king. Aerys opened the gates for his old friend. Instead, Lannister and his men proceeded to [[Sack of King's Landing|plunder and destroy the city]] that he had called home for decades.''

''As the capital was ravaged and its people terrorized, [[Jaime Lannister]], son of Lord Tywin, proved every bit as treacherous. He killed my father, the king, at the foot of the [[Iron Throne]]. The Lannisters entered the [[Red Keep]] and Tywin ordered the deaths of the rest of the royal family. It is said Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]] was found cowering under her father's bed and put to the sword. She was only a child. As for Rhaegar's widow, [[Elia Martell|Elia]], she was forced to watch as Lannister thugs dashed her [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|baby son]]'s head against a wall, before being raped and murdered herself.''

''As [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|I]] was the heir to my father's throne, I had been spirited away to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] with my mother, Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]], who was with child. As a raging summer storm battered the [[Dragonstone|island fortress]] and destroyed the Targaryen fleet as it lay at anchor, my sister [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] was born. My mother, the queen, died giving birth.''

''Now, some seventeen years later, the rightful king still lives in exile. But a day of reckoning is coming. I will sail west, as [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Dragon]] did centuries before. I will take back my father's throne with blood and fire. And I will punish the treacherous dogs who sought to destroy my family. And the people shall rejoice...''
