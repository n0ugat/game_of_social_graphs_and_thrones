The '''Rills'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} are a region along the west coast of the [[North]], west of the [[Barrowlands]] and southwest of [[Winterfell]]. The [[Stony Shore]] forms the coast of the region, while the [[Wolfswood]] and [[Sea Dragon Point]] are located to the north. [[Blazewater Bay]] is to the south.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Rills are a region of hills, lakes and rivers south-west of [[Torrhen's Square]] and north-west of [[Barrowton]]. House Ryswell holds the Rills for the [[House Stark|Starks]] of Winterfell.

The Ryswells are noted for their honor. According to legend, a previous lord of the Rills arrested his own son for deserting the [[Night's Watch]], returning him to the [[Wall]] for trial and execution. The same lord later took the black himself to help amend for his son's treachery.
