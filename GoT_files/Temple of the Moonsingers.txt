==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Temple of the Moonsingers is located on an island west of the [[Red Temple of Braavos|Temple of the Lord of Light]] and northwest of the Isle of the Gods on the junction of the [[Long Canal]]. It is the largest temple of [[Braavos]], being an enormous mass of snow-white marble topped by a huge silvered dome with milk glass windows that show all the phases of the moon. Its gates are flanked by a pair of marble maidens supporting a crescent shaped lintel, both as tall as the [[Sealord of Braavos]]' statues.

The Temple of the Moonsingers is one of the sites that Yorko Terys, the son of [[Ternesio Terys]], points out to [[Arya Stark]] as he brings her to the [[House of Black and White]].
