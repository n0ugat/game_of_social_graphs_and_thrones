The '''ruling council of Astapor''' is an organization established by [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to rule over the city of [[Astapor]] after [[Fall of Astapor|overthrowing]] the [[Good Masters]]. However, not long after Daenerys [[Siege of Meereen|conquers]] [[Meereen]], news arrive that the council has been overthrown by a man named [[Cleon]].{{Ref|GOT405}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daenerys leaves Astapor under the rule of a council of three men, a healer, a scholar and a priest. However, Cleon leads the people to believe that the three intend to return the Good Masters to power. Naming himself king after he has the council executed, he has all the highborn boys of the city seized to begin training new [[Unsullied]].
