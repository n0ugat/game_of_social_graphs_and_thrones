A '''far-eye'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is an instrument used in navigation, consisting of glass lenses arranged inside a metal cylinder in such a way that far-away objects are visually magnified when looking through it.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
When [[Arya Stark]] sails west of [[Westeros]] to explore the [[Sunset Sea]], she picks up a far-eye from the table in her cabin.{{Ref|GOT806}}

==In the books==
"Far-eye" is the term used in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels for a telescope. The word "telescope" never appears in the text.

The best far-eyes are made in the Free City of [[Myr]], by its master lens-crafts, and these telescopes are called Myrish eyes.

[[Order of Maesters|Maesters]] often possess far-eyes to study astronomy. Both Maester [[Luwin]] and Maester [[Aemon]] possessed their own. Jon Snow used Aemon's far-eyes to spy on the wildling camp from the top of the Wall in the lead-up to the [[battle for the Wall]].
