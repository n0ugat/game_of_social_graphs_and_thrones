''Khal'' '''Rhalko''' was a [[Dothraki]] ''[[khal]]''.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
He and the other ''[[khal]]s'' meet at the [[Temple of the Dosh Khaleen|Temple of the ''Dosh Khaleen'']], with their [[bloodrider]]s, in order to decided upon if [[Daenerys Targaryen]] should enter the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]'', after she did not immediately join after [[Drogo]]'s death. When she enters, she is incompetent towards them, and shows that she has no desire to join the ''Dosh Khaleen''. After many sexual insults, she says that she is the only fit to lead the [[Dothraki]]. Rhalko and the other khals find the idea preposterous and they assume that she is mad, and they would never follow her. Daenerys says, however, that they will not serve, but die. She then tips over fiery pillars inside the temple, burning all the ''khals'' and bloodriders inside, including Rhalko.{{Ref|GOT604}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, no Dothraki ''khal'' named "Rhalko" has been mentioned in the storyline as of the fifth novel, ''A Dance with Dragons''. However, the storyline in which Rhalko is involved in the show will not appear in the books until the sixth book in the series, ''The Winds of Winter'', which has not been released yet, so he could appear in that book.
