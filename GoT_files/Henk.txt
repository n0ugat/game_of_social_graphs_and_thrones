'''Henk''' is a soldier sworn to [[House Stark]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Henk and [[Koner]] are stationed at the front gate of [[Winterfell]] when [[Arya Stark]] arrives. Henk asks her what she is doing there and tells her to leave when she replies that she will be entering the castle. He and Koner laugh when she tells them who she is, stating that Arya Stark is dead. She asks for Maester [[Luwin]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], but they reply that there is nobody with those names at Winterfell. She then asks for [[Jon Snow]], and Henk informs her that Jon is a thousand miles away. They insist that she leave, but to their annoyance she asks who is in charge of the castle, and they inform her that it is [[Sansa Stark]]. Henk gives her a final warning and grabs for her, but she easily avoids him. Arya warns them what will happen if Sansa finds out that they turned her sister away and they agree to let her in. They argue over which of them will watch Arya and which of them will report to Sansa, and while they are distracted Arya disappears.{{Ref|GOT704}}

Henk and Koner report to Sansa and tell her who Arya had been asking for; Henk insists that Sansa does not need to concern herself with the matter, as the girl was probably an imposter from the [[winter town]]. Henk promises they will find her, though Sansa replies that they do not have to, as she knows where Arya has gone.{{Ref|GOT704}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the only character named Henk is Henk the Helm, a [[Free Folk|wildling]] raider, who has nothing to do with the Starks. He is among the wildlings who scale the [[Wall]].
