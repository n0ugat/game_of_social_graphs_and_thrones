'''Stygg''' was an [[Ironborn]] raider and member of the ''[[Sea Bitch]]'' crew. He took part in the [[Capture of Winterfell|seizing]] of [[Winterfell]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Stygg is present at the [[sack of Winterfell]] when [[Theon Greyjoy]] gives a speech encouraging his crew to resist the Northmen led by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] and die a glorious death. Instead, [[Dagmer]] knocks Theon unconscious and the garrison surrenders.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] learn that the Ironborn captured at Winterfell were all [[Flaying|flayed]] alive on Ramsay's orders, despite being promised mercy if they surrendered.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Stygg's background is the same. He is among the ironborn who raid the [[Stony Shore]] and part of the force that captures Winterfell.

When the residents of Winterfell are gathered and told that they are captives of the ironborn, Stygg kills [[Mikken]] for speaking defiantly to Theon. [[Osha]] offers to serve Theon (falsely, while she stays loyal to the Starks), Stygg taunts her rudely, and in response she knees him in the groin and grabs his spear, to the amusement of Theon and the other ironborn. After the capture, Theon sends him to request aid from his sister [[Yara Greyjoy|Asha]] at [[Deepwood Motte]].

As Theon's position becomes hopeless, he tells the ironborn they can leave and join his sister's troops at Deepwood Motte or stay and fight with him against the Northmen who will arrive soon to retake Winterfell. Stygg is among those who abandon Theon, and he is the only of those who has the grace to look ashamed.

Stygg is not mentioned in the books afterwards.
