==Biography==
===Background===
[[File:Slaughter.png|thumb|Aegon is killed by Gregor Clegane in front of his mother.]]
Aegon Targaryen was the son of Crown Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and Princess [[Elia Martell]]. He had an older sister, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys Targaryen]],{{Guideref|Viewer's Guide}} and a younger paternal half-brother also named Aegon but raised under the name [[Jon Snow]].{{Ref|GOT610}}{{Ref|GOT707}} For mysterious reasons, Rhaegar allegedly [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] Jon's mother [[Lyanna Stark]], sparking a [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] that ultimately deposed [[House Targaryen]] as the ruling house of [[Westeros]]. Rhaegar was killed by [[Robert Baratheon]], who was Lyanna's betrothed, at the [[Battle of the Trident]]. Soon afterward, Aegon and Rhaenys were brutally murdered along with their mother by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] during the [[Sack of King's Landing]].{{Ref|H&L118}}

Eventually, it is revealed that the [[High Septon (Robert's Rebellion)|High Septon]] at the time annulled the marriage of Rhaegar and Elia and officiated the marriage of Rhaegar and Lyanna on the same day.{{Ref|GOT705}} Whether or not the annulment officially delegitimized Aegon and his sister has yet to be confirmed; however, Jon's apparent legitimacy as Rhaegar's last living son makes him "Aegon VI."{{Ref|GOT801}}

[[Thoros]] of Myr comments how he witnessed Gregor Clegane presenting the bodies of Aegon and Rhaenys before the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|GOT304}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Aegon is mentioned many times, along with his mother and sister, by his maternal uncle [[Oberyn Martell]], who makes it quite clear that he wants justice for their deaths.{{Ref|GOT401}}{{Ref|GOT403}} He gets his chance to confront Gregor when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] demands a [[trial by combat]], to prove his innocence of [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's death]]. Oberyn volunteers to be Tyrion's champion after learning that Gregor will be fighting for the crown.{{Ref|GOT407}}

During the [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|duel]], Oberyn repeatedly accuses the Mountain of killing Elia and her children." Oberyn manages to cut down the Mountain, but is caught off guard when the Mountain suddenly trips him up. The Mountain pins Oberyn to the ground and proceeds to gouge out his eyeballs, making him scream in agony, as he roars for all to hear, "Elia Martell! I killed her children! Then I raped her! Then I smashed her head... in like this!" He then crushes Oberyn's skull, effectively confirming the long-standing rumor of arguably his most infamous war crime.{{Ref|GOT408}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
The deaths of Aegon, his mother and sister are finally avenged by [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]], as he kills (and gets killed by) the Mountain.{{Ref|GOT805}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aegon is the infant son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell. He was ''allegedly'' killed by Gregor Clegane bashing his head in against a wall - then while still covered in the gore of the baby's blood and brains, Gregor raped Aegon's mother and killed her (some say he cut her in half with his sword). In the books, [[Amory Lorch]] separately killed Aegon's sister Rhaenys, but the TV series condensed this with Gregor killing both.

One of the visions Daenerys sees in the [[House of the Undying]] is of her brother Rhaegar, his wife and a baby: Rhaegar decides on the name "Aegon" for his newborn son, as he thinks the name fit for a king; Elia asks whether Rhaegar will make a song for their son, and he replies that Aegon, the [[Prince That Was Promised|prince that was promised]], already has [[the Song of Ice and Fire]]. Rhaegar then says enigmatically that there must be "one more", since "''the dragon has three heads''."

Later, Daenerys tells [[Jorah Mormont]] about her vision. Jorah confirms that the people she saw matched the description of Rhaegar and Elia, and the baby was their heir Aegon; he comments that if Aegon was the prince that was promised, then the promise was broken when he was killed.

In the fifth novel, Daenerys muses about Aegon, who would have been the sixth of his name to sit on the Iron Throne. She believes that, had Aegon lived, she might have married him, as he would have been closer to her in age than [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]].

Unbeknownst to Daenerys, Aegon is alive: [[Varys]] switched him with another baby (the one whom the Mountain killed), smuggled him across the [[Narrow Sea]], and entrusted him to [[Illyrio Mopatis]]. Currently, he is in the custody of [[Jon Connington]], who is determined to do everything in his power to make Aegon ascend the Iron Throne.

[[Quaithe]] enigmatically warns Daenerys of several people, among them the "griffin" and the "mummer's dragon"; Daenerys has no idea who are these people, but to the readers it is obvious Quaithe refers to Connington and Aegon respectively. In contrast to the other people mentioned in Quaithe's obscure prophecy ([[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], Quentyn Martell, [[Victarion Greyjoy]] and the Red Priest Moqorro), Aegon and Connington do not get involved in the current events at [[Slaver's Bay]].

According to Varys, Aegon has been shaped for rule before he could walk; he has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be; he has been taught to read and write and to speak several languages; he has studied history and law and poetry; a septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith; he has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need; he can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. While [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] has been taught that kingship is his ''right'', Aegon knows kingship is his ''duty'', that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.

When Aegon makes his first appearance in the books (before his true identity is revealed to the readers), he is described as a handsome, lithe and well-made youth, with a lanky build and a shock of dark blue hair (his hair is dyed as a part of his disguise) and dark blue eyes, about fifteen or sixteen years old.{{Bookref|ADWD|8}}{{Note|Aegon is actually 18 years old when introduced, since he was born in 282 AC.}}

Aegon is not a POV character. His actions are witnessed and interpreted through the POV of Tyrion (till he is kidnapped by Jorah Mormont) and Connington.

Tyrion travels for a while with Aegon, Connington and their servants. They introduce themselves as Griff and his son, but Tyrion soon figures out their true identities.{{Bookref|ADWD|18}} While Connington acts hostilely toward Tyrion, Aegon befriends him.

Aegon is certain that once he meets Daenerys, she will marry him and give him her armies and dragons, then they will travel to Westeros and conquer it; he sees nothing wrong of the idea of marrying his aunt, according to the Targaryens' custom of marrying their kin (in sharp contrast to Jon Snow, who keeps distance from Daenerys once he is told about his true identity in the show). Hearing that, Tyrion scoffs at Aegon; he explains to the overconfident youth that his aunt is not some timid little girl who does whatever she is told, but a powerful queen, who has crossed deserts, survived assassins, rallied armies and conquered cities, and one who is unlikely to appreciate a relative with a better claim to the [[Iron Throne]] than her own turning up at her court and expecting her to support him. Tyrion concludes that if Aegon appears before her like that (even with the [[Golden Company]]), he'll look like a beggar; he advises Aegon to travel to Westeros instead, raise his banners, rally supporters, and then Daenerys will come and meet him as equals.{{Bookref|ADWD|22}} 

When Aegon and Connington arrive at Volantis (without Tyrion, who has been kidnapped by Jorah at [[Selhorys]]) and join the Golden Company, they find out that Daenerys is still in Meereen, and due to the [[Second siege of Meereen|siege]] - they cannot reach her. Whether Aegon is aware or not of the severity of his aunt's predicament, he does not intend to assist her. He suggests what Tyrion advised him earlier - that they should sail to Westeros instead; nearly all the officers agree. [[Harry Strickland]], coward and hesitant as ever, objects, but no one listen to him.{{Bookref|ADWD|24}}

Soon after Aegon and Connington arrive at Westeros, the Golden Company seizes [[Griffin's Roost]] and several more castles in the Stormlands; Connington's next target is [[Storm's End]]. Aegon, who starts acting arrogantly since his arrival at Westeros, announces that he wants to lead the attack on Storm's End.{{Bookref|ADWD|61}}

Connington starts rallying supporters and allies; first of all, he sends a letter to [[Doran Martell]], informing him that his presumed-dead nephew is alive, and offering an alliance.{{Bookref|ADWD|61}} Doran, cautious as ever, regards the contents of the letter dubiously; since he prefers not to act till he knows for a certainty what is happening, he sends his daughter Arianne to find out whether Aegon and Connington are really the people whom they claim to be.{{Bookref|TWOW|Arianne I}}

Soon, as Connington expected, news about the landing reach King's Landing. [[Mace Tyrell]] and [[Randyll Tarly]] regard the reports rather flippantly; even the report about the alleged fall of Storm's End does not worry them. [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], however, believes that Aegon and Connington (whether they are the people they claim to be or just pretenders) pose a serious threat, which must be dealt without delay, otherwise - as soon as Daenerys arrives at Westeros and joins forces with them, the Lannisters and their allies will not stand a chance.{{Bookref|ADWD|72}}

Since the marriage of Rhaegar and Elia has never been annulled (it is an invention of the TV show), according to the Westerosi inheritance laws Aegon has a stronger claim than Daenerys for the Iron Throne, but it is unclear whether he is ahead of Jon too, since it has not been revealed yet in the books whether Rhaegar married Lyanna or not.

There are fan speculations that the aforementioned youth who claims to be Aegon - is an impostor, whom Varys and Illyrio intend to use as a puppet king in order to gain power. According to these speculations, he could be a [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre]] descendant, Illyrio's son, or just someone with the right age and look (in the [[Free Cities]], there are people who descend from Valyria, and have the Targaryen physical features). The fact that Quaithe refers to him as "the mummer's dragon" may imply (but not confirm) that he is indeed an impostor.

It should be noted that Aegon's book character has not been merged with Jon's show character; Aegon is considered dead in the show.
