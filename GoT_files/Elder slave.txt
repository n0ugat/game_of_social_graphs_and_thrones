An '''elder slave''' is one of the older slaves in [[Meereen]] and has experienced two slaves revolts.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
He is one of the older slaves in [[Meereen]] and has experienced two slaves revolts. He is unwilling to take part in the [[Siege of Meereen|revolt]] in favor of [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] because he thinks all revolts end the same way - with slavers victorious and slaves punished. They are, however, persuaded by [[Grey Worm]] and take up arms against their masters.{{Ref|GOT404}}
