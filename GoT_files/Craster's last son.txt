'''Craster's last son''' is the last male offspring of the [[Free Folk|wildling]] [[Craster]].

==Biography==
===Background===
This baby is the last male offspring of the [[Free Folk|wildling]] [[Craster]], killed by [[Karl Tanner]] of the [[Night's Watch]] during the [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|mutiny]] in which the old wildling was killed. The baby is born months later, while Karl and several other mutinous black brothers are still occupying [[Craster's Keep]]. The child is never given a name.{{Ref|GOT404}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[File:Baby.jpg|thumb|The baby becomes a White Walker.]]
After being told by [[Morag]] that the baby will be a sacrifice for "[[White Walkers|the gods]]", Karl orders [[Rast]] to leave the baby in the woods for the White Walkers to seize him. Some time after Rast abandons the baby in the [[Haunted Forest]], a [[White Walker (Oathkeeper)|White Walker]] seizes him and takes him to the lair of White Walkers, deep in the [[Land of Always Winter]]. After being left at an icy altar, the [[Night King]] takes the boy and puts a finger to his face. The baby's eyes quickly turn the color of those of the White Walkers.{{Ref|GOT404}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Craster's last son is seen in a vision by [[Bran Stark]] while he is being dragged by [[Meera Reed]], [[Battle at the cave of the Three-Eyed Raven|fleeing]] from a horde of [[wight]]s.{{Ref|GOT605}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Craster's wives are convinced that the baby boys given by Craster to the Others are, in turn, transformed into new Others. However, no such event has ever been witnessed in the books so far.

[[Craster's wives]] do say that they ''believe'' that the infant sons that Craster gave the Others as sacrifices were turned into new White Walkers - but it wasn't clear if this is what ''actually'' happens, or if it was just the wild suspicion of Craster's frightened, isolated wives. When Samwell is told to flee with Gilly and her newborn son, Gilly urges that if he doesn't "they" will come for him. When he asks who "they" are, another wife says: "The boy's brothers...Craster's sons. The white cold's rising out there, crow. I can feel it in my bones. These poor old bones don't lie. They'll be here soon, the sons."

Confirmation of what exactly happens to Craster's sons has not occurred in the books yet.
