'''Widow's Wail'''{{Ref|GOT402}} is one of two [[Valyrian steel]] blades reforged from [[Ice]], the ancestral sword of [[House Stark]]. Its sister blade is [[Oathkeeper]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[File:Widow's_Wail.png|thumb|180x180px|The hilt of Widow's Wail, featuring the stag of House Baratheon - decorated with Lannister gold.]]

A member of the [[Kingsguard]] presents the sword in its scabbard for king [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s approval, while [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] announces that it is one of only two swords of Valyrian steel in [[King's Landing]]. Overjoyed, Joffrey quickly draws the blade and begins to toy with it, leading [[Pycelle]] to warn him of Valyrian steel's famous edge. Joffrey responds with a swift hack at his copy of [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Kaeth]]'s ''[[The Lives of Four Kings]]'' (which [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] had just presented him a few moments earlier as a wedding present), but it takes him several more swipes to completely destroy it. He then asks the other guests present at the breakfast to think of a name for the blade. After a few suggestions, he quickly settles on the name "Widow's Wail", befitting to Joffrey’s petty cruelty whilst noting that it would be like [[Execution of Eddard Stark|beheading Ned Stark]] whenever he used it.

When the ceremonial [[pigeon pie]] is brought out at the [[Purple Wedding|wedding feast]], Joffrey uses Widow's Wail to slice the crust open so the birds can fly out. His cut was so savage that some of the pigeons inside are decapitated. He never leaves the wedding with it however, as he is [[Strangler|poisoned]] moments later.<ref>"[[The Lion and the Rose]]"</ref>

During the funeral service held in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], the sword is placed along Joffrey's corpse.<ref>"[[Breaker of Chains]]"</ref>

While naturally, Widow's Wail would have been passed down to [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], by choice or advice, he never took up the weapon. Unseen after Joffrey's funeral, it is assumed to be placed somewhere within the [[Red Keep]].

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] takes to carrying Widow's Wail after his return from the [[Riverlands]]. After the [[Sack of Highgarden]], [[Olenna Tyrell]] notices Jaime wielding Joffrey's sword and asks him if he will use it to kill her, to which Jaime replies that he will not, choosing to use poison instead. When Olenna asks what Joffrey called his sword, Jaime replies, "Widow's Wail", to which Olenna calls Joffrey a c***, and Jaime agrees silently.<ref>"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref>
[[File:704 Jaime Bronn.jpg|thumb|Jaime carrying the sword in the [[Battle of the Goldroad]].]]
The sword later sees its first real taste of combat at the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], where Jaime uses it against the [[Dothraki]] horde.<ref>"[[The Spoils of War]]"</ref>

Jaime later brings it with him when he leaves King's Landing and heads north.<ref>"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
[[File:Jaime Knighting S8 E2.jpg|thumb|Jaime using the sword to knight Brienne.]]
Widow's Wail is temporarily confiscated by [[Grey Worm]] upon Jaime's arrival in [[Winterfell]]. It is returned to him after [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] allows Jaime to remain in Winterfell and fight the army of the [[White Walkers]]. Jaime later uses Widow's Wail to knight [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]].<ref>"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"</ref>  The weapon is then used with proficiency by Jaime to slay dozens of wights during the [[Battle of Winterfell]].<ref>"[[The Long Night]]"</ref>

Jaime takes Widow's Wail with him upon leaving Winterfell to return to King's Landing.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref> However, it is confiscated when he is arrested by Daenerys's soldiers. He cannot reclaim it once he is released by Tyrion,<ref>"[[The Bells]]"</ref> thus the exact current whereabouts of the sword is unknown.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[File:WidowsWail Sword.jpg|thumb]]Joffrey selected the name because it reminded him of Ned Stark's beheading, but Sansa was Ned's daughter, not his widow: [[Catelyn Stark]] was not present. It's possible that Joffrey was trying to mock both Sansa and the late Catelyn, but it's more likely that Joffrey, as usual, just did what came to mind without justification.
**Ironically (or perhaps appropriately), his mother [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] (a widow herself) mourns his death a few hours later. Appropriately, Joffrey's own widow did not wail.
*There was confusion in the series over what happened to the weapon after Joffrey's death, since neither Tommen nor Jaime was seen with it. It was not until "[[The Queen's Justice]]" that it was confirmed that Jaime had started using it, meaning it was at least being kept by Cersei in the Red Keep.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Widow's Wail is described as having a cherry red hue in the steel under strong light. The hilt also featured a red leather grip for the handle, with golden lion paws for the crossguard, whereas the show counterpart is modeled around silver stags with a ruby set in the middle, symbolizing the Lannister-Baratheon alliance.

When Joffrey cuts the book Tyrion gave him, he says "I am no stranger to Valyrian steel". This comment makes Tyrion realize it was actually Joffrey who sent the [[catspaw]] to kill [[Bran Stark|Bran]].

Joffrey never used Widow's Wail to cut open the pigeon pie at his wedding feast, because Margaery insisted that it would be inappropriate to use it for such a task. Joffrey orders [[Ilyn Payne]] to give him his greatsword to cut it instead. [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], remembering that the headsman used her father's own blade [[Ice]] to decapitate him, notes that he must have discarded it. Tyrion, however, puts two and two together, and realizes that Ice was melted down to make Widow's Wail. He then regrets never returning the blade to Robb when the latter demanded it back as part of his peace terms (which occurred at the beginning of [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]] in the TV series).

It is not mentioned in the books what has become of the sword after Joffrey's death. According to [[George R.R. Martin]], Widow's Wail was passed down to Tommen when he ascended to the throne - but while Tommen technically owns the sword, he is still too young to wield it (he is only eight years old when Joffrey dies in the books).<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2761 So Spake Martin, April 14, 2008]</ref>

In the books, it is mentioned that Joffrey named his new sword "Widow's Wail" by picking it out from several names the crowd suggested, but it does not list what the other names were. In this episode (which Martin himself wrote anyway), some alternate names are heard, including "Stormbringer", "Terminus", and "Wolf's Bane". "Stormbringer" is apparently a reference to the sword of the same name wielded by the main character in Michael Moorcock's [[Wikipedia:Elric of Melniboné|Elric Saga]] (as well as Joffrey's believed [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|Baratheon]] descent), while "Terminus" references "[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_Est Terminus Est]", the blade wielded by the protagonist of Gene Wolfe's ''[[Wikipedia:The Book of the New Sun|The Book of the New Sun]]'' novel series (Martin lists Wolfe as a [https://grrm.livejournal.com/424135.html major influence]).
