The [[Faceless Men]] use the combination of [[magic]] spells and faces of the dead to create their different camouflages. The faces of the cleansed corpses are flayed and hung to dry within the Hall of Faces.

==Structure==
The Hall of Faces lies within a large, secret chamber. It is created of stone, with large pillars that house the faces of the dead.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Upon passing the game of faces, [[Jaqen H'ghar]] brings [[Arya Stark|Arya]] to the Hall of Faces. She realizes her work as an acolyte has prepared the bodies to have their faces skinned.<ref>"[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
After Arya Stark successfully kills the [[Waif]], she crudely adds the Waif's face to the Hall of Faces, leaving a clear blood trail.
