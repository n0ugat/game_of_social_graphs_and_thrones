{{Quote|Let me die.|The slave to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]|Walk of Punishment (episode)}}
A '''tortured slave''' is a [[Slavery|slave]] who is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public on the [[Walk of Punishment]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
He is a slave who presumably showed insubordination of some kind to his [[Good Masters|masters]], and after being viciously whipped is strapped to a cross and left to die out in public on the Walk of Punishment, as a warning to all other slaves. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] offers the man water, but he refuses to drink, saying that he just wants to die quickly, as drinking the water will only prolong his suffering.{{Ref|GOT303}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, when Daenerys walks through the streets of [[Astapor]] and comes to the Plaza of Punishment, she sees a wooden platform where rebellious slaves are racked, [[Flaying|flayed]] and hanged; in contrast to the show, she does not try to help any of them.
