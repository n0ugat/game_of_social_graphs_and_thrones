{{Quote|A man called Craghas Drahar has styled himself the prince-admiral of this Triarchy. They call him 'The Crabfeeder' due to his inventive methods of punishing his enemies.|[[Corlys Velaryon]]|The Heirs of the Dragon}}
Prince '''Craghas Drahar''' was a [[Myr]]ish [[prince]]-admiral of the [[Triarchy]]. He was known as the '''Crabfeeder''' for his habit of feeding his surviving enemies to crabs by staking them to the shores during the low tide.

His occupation and blockade of the [[Stepstones]] caught the attention of Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] and Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]], who launched the [[War for the Stepstones]] to defeat him. He was killed by Daemon during the [[siege of Bloodstone]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Craghas is from the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of Myr.{{Ref|HOTD102}} He suffers from [[greyscale]] which has spread to his face and brain,<ref>''[[Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon: Inside the Creation of a Targaryen Dynasty]]''</ref> causing him to wear a mask. The broken mask, which he found in a shipwreck, is of [[Ghiscari]] origin - the same kind that would be used by the [[Sons of the Harpy]] almost two centuries later.{{Ref|THTDB102}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:WA Crabfeeder.png|thumb|Sailors and Pirates staked on the beeches.]]
At a meeting of the [[Small Council]], [[Corlys Velaryon]] reports that three of the Free Cities have formed an alliance named the "[[Triarchy]]", and that Craghas Drahar has styled himself as its prince-admiral.{{Ref|HOTD101}}
[[File:OT Stepstones 2.png|thumb|Staking his prisoners for the crabs.]]
As tensions rise, Drahar's forces begin attacking [[Westeros]]i ships passing through the Stepstones, including those of the [[Velaryon fleet]]. He executes captured crewmen by staking them on beaches to be devoured by carnivorous crabs or be drowned by the tide. In response, Corlys prepares to go to war, convincing [[Daemon Targaryen]] to join him.{{Ref|HOTD102}}

Over the next two years, Drahar would slowly lose ground during the war, until his men discovered a way to gain an advantage over the dragons - by hiding in the caves along the coast of the Stepstones to avoid the dragonfire.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

Two years after the start of the war Drahar [[Siege of Bloodstone|was besieged at Bloodstone]], where he and his men resisted attacks by Daemon's army during the day and launched their own raids on the Velaryon ships at night. While executing prisoners, Daemon arrived on [[Caraxes]]. His men forced him to retreat while Drahar hid in his hideout where Caraxes could not get to him.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

News of his growing Drahar victory reached King's Landing, leading many to wonder if the king should help Corlys and Daemon despite their insubordination.{{Ref|HOTD103}}[[File:Daniel-scott-smith-1-cb6cc96.jpg|thumb|Drahar commanding Triarchy forces at the Siege of Bloodstone.|left]]During the [[siege of Bloodstone]], Daemon rows alone to the beach, before waving a white flag and offering [[Dark Sister]] in an act of surrender. When Drahar walks out of the caves to see if his foe has truly accepted defeat, he is shocked when the Targaryen feigns submission and begins to cut a path through the Triarchy soldiers; Daemon had caused his forces to exit their caves for a counter-attack, allowing [[Laenor Velaryon]] to ambush the Triarchy archers with his dragon [[Seasmoke]] and letting the Velaryon forces reach the shores unharmed to attack the remaining soldiers.{{Ref|HOTD103}}
Seeing his defeat on the horizon, Drahar retreats into a cave but is pursued by Daemon and killed. The Triarchy leader's bisected corpse is later dragged out by Daemon for everyone to see, signifying Daemon's victory over the Crabfeeder.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

After the war, Daemon uses Drahar's warhammer to stake Triarchy corsairs on the beaches. He later brings it before [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]], tossing it and telling him to add it to the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|HOTD104}} Corlys also makes a souvenir of one of Drahar's possessions: his mask, which he displays in the Hall of Nine in [[High Tide]].{{Ref|HOTD105}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Craghas Drahar led the Triarchy's military forces in its conquest of the [[Stepstones]]. During this campaign he gained the sobriquet "Crabfeeder" for executing hundreds of pirates by staking them to be drowned by the tide. There is no mention he suffered from greyscale, or wore a mask.

Due to extremely high tolls enacted by the Triarchy in the region, Corlys Velaryon started a war for the Stepstones, partnering with Daemon Targaryen. After winning many battles for two years, Daemon personally beheaded Craghas with Dark Sister in 108 AC.
