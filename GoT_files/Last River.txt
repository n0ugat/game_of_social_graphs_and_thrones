The '''Last River'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is the northern-most major river of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. It is located in the [[North]]. The river flows out of the foothills of the southern [[Frostfangs]] and eastwards through the lands of [[House Umber]], past their main castle at [[Last Hearth]]. The river then turns southwards and empties into the [[Shivering Sea]] north-east of the [[Dreadfort]]. The lands of [[House Karstark]] lie to the north-east of the river and the lands of [[House Bolton]] to the south. The [[Kingsroad]] crosses the river on its way north to the [[Wall]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels the Last River is in the same location. It isn't the last river at all before the Wall (which is still several hundred miles to the north), as smaller bodies of water can be found (such as the lake at [[Queenscrown]]), but it is the last major river of any note.
