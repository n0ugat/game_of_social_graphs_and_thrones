{{Quote|My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber, while she sewed, and read to her. My father put a stop to it, when he found out.|[[Samwell Tarly]] giving [[Gilly]] a thimble|What Is Dead May Never Die}}

When [[Jon Snow]] asks Sam what he is doing at the [[Wall]], Sam tells him that his father did not think him manly enough to inherit his title and lands so he forced him to join the Night's Watch or he implied that he would kill him and tell Melessa that it was a hunting accident.{{Ref|GOT104}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Before leaving [[Craster's Keep]], Sam gives [[Gilly]] a thimble that once belonged to his mother. He explains that he used to read to her while she was sewing but that his father ended the practice when he found out. He reveals that the thimble is the only possession he has from her and that it was a gift given when he left for Wall.{{Ref|GOT203}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===

[[File:Blood of my blood House Tarly dinner.jpg|thumb|The Tarly family has dinner with Gilly.]]
Melessa responds just as Sam expected, eagerly greeting him as he arrives. She is also delighted when she sees little Sam, and coos over her "grandchild". At dinner that evening, Melessa notices that Gilly seems unused to cutlery and seems to be copying her when trying to eat. She later sits uncomfortably as Randyll insults Sam repeatedly, and finally stands up for him, offering the opinion that being the [[Order of Maesters|maester]] to the Night's Watch is an honor. When Randyll realizes that Gilly is a [[Free Folk|wildling]], Melessa listens to his rant before finally snapping and giving him a piece of her mind, then storming out with Gilly and Talla in tow.{{Ref|GOT606}}

When Sam takes Gilly and the baby and escapes in the middle of the night, he tells Gilly that his mother will understand.{{Ref|GOT606}}
