{{Quote|After Aegon and his dragons burned our last king, Harren the Black, and broke our armies, the defeated Ironborn chose my ancestor, Vickon Greyjoy, as Lord of the Iron Islands, not king.|[[Euron Greyjoy]]|The Kingsmoot}}
Lord '''Vickon Greyjoy''' was the head of [[House Greyjoy]] and the [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]] during the reign of King [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] of [[House Hoare]].

==Biography==
After Harren and his line were burned alive by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and his [[Balerion|dragon inside]] his castle of [[Harrenhal]] during [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]], the [[Ironborn]] were expelled from the [[Riverlands]] back to the [[Iron Islands]]. In exchange for their allegiance, Aegon allowed the Ironborn to choose their new leader. They chose Vickon Greyjoy: his House was one of the most prominent in the Isles, claiming descent from the legendary [[Grey King]]. However, he was made Lord of the Iron Islands, not a King. Because of this, the [[kingsmoot]] continued to just crown Vickon's descendants as their leader.{{Ref|H&L209}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Vickon Greyjoy's story is the same.
