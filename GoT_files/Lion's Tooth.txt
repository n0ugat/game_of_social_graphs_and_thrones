'''Lion's Tooth'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a sword owned by Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. Its name was a reference to the sigil of [[House Lannister]], a [[lion]], the house of Joffrey's mother, Queen [[Cersei Lannister]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] come across [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and her friend [[Mycah]] playing at swordfighting with sticks. Joffrey threatens Mycah with Lion's Tooth, cutting his cheek with it. Ayra strikes Joffrey in Mycah's defense, and Joffrey turns on her, slashing at her with the sword. [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]] attacks Joffrey in Arya's defense, causing him to drop Lion's Tooth. Ayra picks it up and, after holding it to Joffrey's wimpering face, tosses it into the [[Trident]]. The sword is never recovered.<ref>"[[The Kingsroad]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
On the eve of the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Joffrey has it replaced with a new sword, [[Hearteater]].<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the history of the sword is the same.

Later, in the third novel, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] inaccurately remembers the name of Joffrey's sword as "Lion's Paw" instead of "Lion's Tooth". [[George R.R. Martin]] has stated that he intended this mistake in-universe (it wasn't a typographical error), one of his points highlighting that the characters' memories are not infallible.<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/2999/ So Spake Martin, June 26, 2001]</ref>
