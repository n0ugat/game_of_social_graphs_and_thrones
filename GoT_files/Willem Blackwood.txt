{{Quote|I once vied for Queen Rhaenyra's hand, before she wed Ser Laenor. I always liked her spirit. She had the true blood of the dragon.|Willem Blackwood|The Red Dragon and the Gold}}
Ser '''Willem Blackwood''' was a member of [[House Blackwood]] during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]. By the early stages of the [[Dance of the Dragons]] he has achieved [[knighthood]] and become the regent of [[Raventree Hall]], in the name of the child lord [[Benjicot Blackwood]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Willem is a member of House Blackwood of [[Raventree Hall]].{{Ref|HOTD104}} He is a younger brother of Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]] and uncle to [[Benjicot Blackwood]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
When [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s tour of the realm reaches [[Storm's End]], Willem is among the suitors gathered to seek the princess's favor, though the princess is skeptical due to his youth. He cites the long relationship between House Blackwood and [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]], and his house's deep roots in [[Westeros]]. Meanwhile, an older suitor, [[Jerrel Bracken]], taunts and mocks him and his house. Rhaenyra seems to prefer Jerrel to Willem, so Willem turns to leave, stung by the princess's rejection. As he leaves, Jerrel calls him a craven, prompting him to draw his sword, followed by Jerrel drawing a dagger, and a duel ensues. Though Jerrel initially has the upper hand, knocking Willem to the floor, Willem soon defeats and fatally stabs Jerrel in the gut. As Jerrel dies, Willem stumbles back and begins to vomit.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Willem, now a knight and regent for the child Lord [[Benjicot Blackwood]] answers the summons of King Consort [[Daemon Targaryen]] and attends a council at [[Harrenhal]] where he offers the levies of House Blackwood in exchange for Daemon's and [[Caraxes]]'s aid against [[House Bracken]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}
[[File:2x5 Brackens.jpg|thumb|Willem and Daemon at a parley with the [[House Bracken|Brackens]].]]
Willem is present at a meeting between Daemon and Lord [[Amos Bracken]]; when Amos insults both House Blackwood and Willem's late brother, Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]], Willem urges Daemon to kill Amos. After Amos rebuffs Daemon's terms and departs, Daemon unofficially gives Willem leave to commit a terror campaign to force House Bracken's submission, provided he does not appear to be acting under the crown's orders. Willem's terror tactics on Bracken lands force the Brackens to yield, but because his forces fly [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]]'s banner during their raids, the Riverlords quickly deduce and are outraged that his atrocities were sanctioned by Daemon, and confront Daemon at Harrenhal, denouncing him as a tyrant and making clear their refusal to give him their allegiance.{{Ref|HOTD205}}
[[File:Willem face off the Brackens..png|thumb|Willem faces the Brackens.]]
[[Oscar Tully]], the new [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]], arrives with the Riverlords at Harrenhal. While Willem meets them in the [[Godswood]] with his Bracken prisoners. Lord Oscar proclaims his intention to honour [[Grover Tully|his late grandfather]]'s oath of loyalty to Rhaenyra as [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]'s heir and offers [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] his allegiance. The Riverlords doubt young Oscar's leadership ability and despise Daemon for allowing the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]]' war atrocities against [[House Bracken]].
[[File:House-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-7-13.jpg|thumb|Willem taken into custody. ]]To appease the other [[Lordship|lords]], Oscar condemns [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Willem Blackwood]]'s savagery, though Willem claims he was doing Daemon's bidding. Oscar dismisses Willem's excuse, as wanted to commit them and declares he must be held accountable. Oscar demands that Daemon prove himself worthy of the Riverlords' banners by showing contrition for his earlier actions and dispensing justice. Daemon reluctantly agrees and executes Willem, while he pleads for his life. 

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Willem Blackwood. His first appearance is loosely based on Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]], who lost a duel (but was not killed) to Amos Bracken for Rhaenyra's hand.

In the books, there are no recorded [[Knighthood|knights]] from House Blackwood. Indeed, the Blackwoods refuse knighthood as they follow the [[Old Gods|old gods]], and knighthood is an institution of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. For this reason, they are often granted the right to compete in knights' [[Tournament|tourneys]] without knighthoods, for example the [[tournament at Ashford Meadow]].
