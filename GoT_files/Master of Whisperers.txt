The '''Master of Whisperers'''{{Ref|GOT109}} is the adviser in matters of intelligence and espionage to the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]] and holds a seat on the [[Small Council]]. 

==History==
===Background===
During the reign of King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert I Baratheon]], this position is held by [[Varys]], a foreign [[eunuch]] that held the title since the latter years of the reign of the Mad King, [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. Varys remains in the role under Robert's successors, King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey I]] and King [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen I]]. Varys's true loyalties, however, continue to lie with [[House Targaryen]].<ref>"[[The Wars To Come]]"</ref> He calls his worldwide spy network his "[[little birds]]".<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref> Varys served Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] as her Master of Whisperers.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

The Master of Whisperers's spy network is not the only one that existed, although it was the largest. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] used his many [[Prostitution|prostitutes]], such as [[Olyvar]], and brothels to obtain information.<ref>"[[Kissed by Fire]]"</ref> The handmaiden [[Bernadette]] works for [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]].<ref>"[[Two Swords]]"</ref> When meeting with the Small Council (Varys, Baelish, Pycelle, Tyrion, and Cersei), [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] angrily asks why no one can find his son [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] when "collectively you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined".<ref>"[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"</ref>

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
King [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] names [[Larys Strong]] as his Master of Whisperers, filling a long vacancy caused by [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]'s opinion that he had no need for a Master of Whisperers.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Following Varys's escape from [[Westeros]] with [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], the office was left vacant. When Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] reorganized the Small Council after [[Assassinations in the Tower of the Hand|Tyrion murdered their father]], she took control over the council and stacked it with sycophants. One of her actions was to appoint [[Qyburn]] as the new Master of Whisperers - despite the fact that he is a disgraced former [[Order of Maesters|maester]] who was expelled from the [[Citadel]] after it was learned he was conducting human experimentation, dissecting living men. Cersei ignored [[Pycelle]]'s objections to this controversial choice- including asking what qualifications Qyburn even had for such a post - by simply saying that he had demonstrated his loyalty to her, more than Varys ever did. Minutes after this announcement, along with Cersei's other choices in restaffing the council, her uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] bluntly declared that she was stacking the Small Council with sycophants, and left for [[Casterly Rock]] in disgust.<ref>"[[The House of Black and White]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
The office is currently vacant, as Daenerys executed Varys for treason, and Qyburn was killed by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].<ref>"[[The Bells]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Varys was Master of Whisperers under King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] at the time of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. He cautioned the king not to let Tywin Lannister's army within the gates, but [[Grand Maester]] Pycelle (secretly Tywin's agent) convinced the Mad King that Tywin had come to turn the tide of the war back in his favor, and to let his army inside the gates. As soon as the army entered the Lannisters turned on the Targaryens, in the destructive [[Sack of King's Landing]]. After Robert Baratheon was crowned king, he pardoned Varys and kept him in his position as Master of Whisperers, which he would maintain through the rest of Robert's rule. Thus, by the beginning of the narrative, Varys has been the head of the realm's spy network for over twenty years. It is unknown specifically why Robert pardoned Varys, let alone kept him in such a sensitive position, though it may simply be because he was very good at his job. In truth, this was very detrimental to Robert, as Varys secretly remains a Targaryen loyalist, in contact with [[Illyrio Mopatis]] in orchestrating the affairs of Prince [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]], and the marriage of his sister Princess Daenerys Targaryen to Khal [[Drogo]], although the only Small Councilors who ever learned the truth did so in their last moments of life.

During his time as [[Hand of the King]], [[Brynden Rivers|Brynden "Bloodraven" Rivers]] was also the Master of Whisperers. Since he had lost his left eye in his duel against his half-brother [[Aegor Rivers|Aegor "Bittersteel" Rivers]] in the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]], this inspired the saying "How many eyes does Lord Bloodraven have? A thousand eyes, and one."

''The World of Ice & Fire'' sourcebook (2014) mentions other masters of whisperers in passing. The Targaryens actually had a long unofficial tradition of recruiting unpopular Masters of Whisperers from the Free Cities, so Varys's situation is actually not that unusual. The other prominent holders of the office were actually ''Mistresses'' of Whisperers, being women who seem to have held the title openly (and were also actual mistresses to the kings in question).
