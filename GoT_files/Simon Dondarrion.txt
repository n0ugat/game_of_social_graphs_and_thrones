Lord '''Simon Dondarrion'''{{Con|F&B}} was the [[Lord of Blackhaven]] during the reign of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Simon once hosted Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen]] at [[Blackhaven]]. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his son [[Beric Dondarrion (son of Simon)|Beric]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Beric mentions his father whilst vying for [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s hand at [[Storm's End]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Simon was said to be gallant and handsome. He was a skilled singer, harpist, and jouster. He is not mentioned to have fathered any issue.

Simon sang to the king and queen when he hosted them at Blackhaven in 54 AC, very much to the queen's liking; the royal party stayed with [[House Dondarrion]] much longer than they had planned. The next year, Simon won a [[tournament]] marking the completion of the [[Dragonpit]], giving the victor's laurel to Princess [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Jaehaerys I)|Daenerys Targaryen]]. In 58 AC, he was defeated by Ser [[Ryam Redwyne]] in a tournament celebrating Jaehaerys's tenth anniversary as king.

Simon was a notable commander in the Third Dornish War, trapping the second Vulture King in the [[Red Mountains]] from the west while the king and Lord Rogar Baratheon closed in on the outlaws from the east.
