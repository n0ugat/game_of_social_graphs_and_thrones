'''House Reyne'''{{Ref|GOT308}} of [[Castamere]] is an extinct vassal house of the [[Westerlands]], formerly sworn to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. Their seat was the castle of Castamere until it was torched during the [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt]], along with all members of the family.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:ReyneSigil.jpg|thumb|The red lion of House Reyne.]]
[[File:ReyneRebellion.png|thumb|The red lion of Reyne confronts the golden lion of Lannister.]]
For a time, House Reyne was the second wealthiest family in Westeros, behind House Lannister. They were not content with being the second wealthiest, however, and the last Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock, and gave his wife diamonds to wear which were bigger than any that [[Tywin Lannister]]'s wife [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]] ever wore.<ref name="E28">"[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"</ref>

Eventually, House Reyne [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt|openly challenged]] their liege-lords, feeling that House Lannister's rule over the Westerlands had grown weak under Tywin's ineffectual father [[Tytos Lannister]]. In response, however, the capable young Tywin Lannister marched his forces against the upstart Lord Reyne. At the end of the [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt]], Tywin's army put Castamere castle to the torch, and had all surviving members of House Reyne put to the sword - man, woman, and child - as an example to any vassals who would dare challenge the Lannisters in the future. Tywin subsequently had the corpses of the executed Reynes hanged from the gates of Casterly Rock on public display, where he left them to rot for the entire summer (it was a long summer, which lasted many years).<ref name="Lannister short">"[[House Lannister (short)|House Lannister]]"</ref><ref>"[[The Westerlands]]"</ref><ref name="E28" />

The destruction of House Reyne was immortalized in the song "[[The Rains of Castamere]]."<ref name="Lannister short" />

The song "[[The Rains of Castamere]]" is later performed scornfully during the [[Red Wedding]], in which King [[Robb Stark]]'s entire Northern army is slaughtered by [[House Bolton]] and [[House Frey]] in a coup devised with [[House Lannister]].<ref>"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
"The Rains of Castamere" is played during the wedding of King Joffrey Baratheon and Margaery Tyrell, though Joffrey cuts the performance short by tossing some money to the minstrels.

House Reyne's destruction is avenged, ironically enough by a Lannister, when Tyrion Lannister kills his father Tywin as revenge for the treatment he'd suffered.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Reynes were one of the richest and most powerful families in the Westerlands after the Lannisters. During their defiance against Casterly Rock and Lord [[Tytos Lannister]], the Reynes rose alongside the ancient House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall. Both houses were totally annihilated by Tywin Lannister.
