'''White Knife'''{{Ref|H&L304}} is a river in the [[North]]. It consists of two rivers, one originating in [[Long Lake]] and the other in hills to the east, which come together north-east of [[Winterfell]]. The river runs south into the [[Bite]], with the city of [[White Harbor]] located at its mouth.

==History==
The White Knife were once infested with pirates, until the [[House Stark|Stark]] [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] drove them away.<ref>"[[House Bolton (short)|House Bolton]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels the White Knife has two branches, one originating in the Lonely Hills and the other in Long Lake. The White Knife is the primary waterway of the North and one of its most important methods of transportation.

A separate tributary originates in the west, near the edge of the Wolfswood and Winterfell, but it is not part of the White Knife itself.
