'''Joyeuse Frey''', née '''Erenford''', was the eighth wife of Lord [[Walder Frey]], the Lord of the Crossing.

==Biography==
===Background===
Joyeuse Erenford was 15 years old and the eighth wife of Lord [[Walder Frey]], the [[Lord of the Crossing]].<ref name="House Frey viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/frey/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Frey entry]</ref> She was a member of [[House Erenford]], a lesser house of landed knights from the [[Riverlands]] sworn to [[House Frey]] of the [[Twins]].{{Cite}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Catelyn Stark]] talks to a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Frey]] at the [[Inn at the Crossroads|Crossroads Inn]]. He tells her that Lord Walder is about to celebrate his 90th [[nameday]] and has taken another wife in celebration of the event. [[Tyrion Lannister]] finds this notion amusing, at least until the [[Frey knight]] agrees to help Catelyn take Tyrion prisoner for the attempted murder of her son [[Bran Stark|Bran]].{{Ref|GOT104}}

[[File:Walder and Joyeuse 1x09.png|thumb|Lord Walder and his new wife.]]
Arriving at the [[Twins]], Catelyn greets Lord Walder Frey and his young, 15-year-old wife, Lady Joyeuse, whom Lord Walder gropes even as he speaks. Walder dismisses his family, including Joyeuse, while he and Catelyn haggle on what price the [[House Stark|Starks]] will pay to be allowed to cross the river.{{Ref|GOT109}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Lady Joyeuse is present at the main hall of the [[Twins]] when [[Robb Stark]] presents himself to pay his respects to Lord Walder and beg his forgiveness for the breaking of their [[marriage]] pact. She remains with her husband during the wedding ceremony of [[Edmure Tully]] and [[Roslin Tully|Roslin Frey]] and sits beside him during the feast, but doesn't take part in the [[bedding ceremony]].{{Ref|GOT309}}

[[File:Catelyn_kills_Joyeuse.jpeg|thumb|Lady Frey is killed by Catelyn Stark.]]
When the [[Red Wedding|massacre]] of the Stark household and bannermen begins, Joyeuse, visibly scared, hides under a table while the carnage takes place. Injured, [[Catelyn Stark]] takes her hostage and threatens to kill her if Robb is not allowed to leave the Twins untouched. However, Lord Walder refuses, boasting he can get a new wife. After Robb is murdered by [[Roose Bolton]], Catelyn slits Joyeuse's throat out of frustration.{{Ref|GOT309}}

==Behind the scenes==
Kelly Long has been a stand-in for [[Emilia Clarke]], [[Michelle Fairley]], [[Lena Headey]], and [[Sophie Turner]]. In Season 2, Long also began working full-time for ''<nowiki>Game of Thrones'</nowiki>''s art department.<ref>http://www.thetimewarriors.co.uk/blog/?p=8002</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lady Joyeuse is slightly older than in the TV show, aged sixteen. House Erenford is a minor vassal house of the [[Riverlands]], sworn to [[House Frey]]. In the books, Catelyn does not kill her during the Red Wedding, but Aegon (also known as "Jinglebell"), Lord Frey's [[halfwit]] grandson (not included in the TV series). Lady Joyeuse is later mentioned to be pregnant.
