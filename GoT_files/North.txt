{{Quote|The North is by far the largest of the Seven Kingdoms; it can fit the other six inside it. Not that the others care... cold and damp, that's how the southerners see the North. But without the cold, a man can't appreciate the fire in his hearth. Without the rain, a man can't appreciate the roof over his head. Let the south have its sun, flowers, and affectations. We northerners have home.|[[Jon Snow]]|The North}}
The '''North''',{{Ref|GOT101}} also known as the '''Kingdom of the North''',{{Ref|H&L102}} is a realm of [[Westeros]]. It was formerly one of the constituent regions of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] after [[Aegon's Conquest]], but seceded during the [[War of the Five Kings]] under King in the North [[Robb Stark]]. Following the [[Red Wedding]], the North returned to the jurisdiction of the Iron Throne under [[House Bolton]]. After [[House Stark]] regained control of the region, the North once again seceded under [[Jon Snow]], who later pledged the North to Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] in exchange for [[House Targaryen]]'s aid during the [[Great War]]. It was finally allowed to become independent again by [[Bran Stark]] following the [[Last War]].

[[Image:Distant Winterfell.jpg|thumb|Travelers in the North, with the castle of Winterfell in the distance.]][[Image:North.PNG|thumb|right|343x343px|Map of the continent of Westeros, marking the location of the North in red.]]
The North is ruled from the castle of [[Winterfell]] by [[House Stark]]. It is the largest of the nine major regions of the continent, almost equal in size to the other eight combined. Its total population is under one million. The North is also considered the poorest region of the Seven Kingdoms. <!--I have commented this out because it has been challenged and a source asked for: "However, due to its harsh climate it has one of the smallest populations of any major region in the Seven Kingdoms, and is the most sparsely populated." It should not be restored to the article without adding a source. [[User:Opark 77]]--> 

According to legend, the Kingdom of the North was established eight thousand years ago by [[Brandon the Builder|Bran the Builder]], the founder of House Stark, who constructed the [[Wall]] as a shield against the possible return of the [[White Walkers]]. The North is the only region where the [[First Men]] were able to successfully resist the [[coming of the Andals]], six thousand years before the War of the Five Kings. As a result the North is the only region of [[Westeros]] in which the [[Northmen|ethnic]] makeup is predominantly First Men, and the only region where the [[Cultures and peoples|culture, customs, and traditions]] of the First Men still predominate. Among these is the belief that the man who passes the [[Execution|sentence of death]] must swing the sword himself. In particular, the religion of the First Men, the worship of the [[Old Gods]], is still the dominant faith in the North. The [[Faith of the Seven]] introduced in southern Westeros by the [[Andals]] has found little foothold in the North. As a result, warriors from the North are not "knights" (with very few exceptions), because "[[knighthood]]" is a code of values associated with the Faith of the Seven. However, mounted warriors are still an honored and esteemed military asset in the North, so that while northmen like [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] may not carry the title "Ser", Northern cavalry are functionally equivalent to mounted knights.  

[[Bastard]] children of noble blood born in the North are given the surname Snow. People of the North are known as [[Northmen]] (or Northerners), and, derogatorily as wolves, in reference to the [[Heraldry|sigil]] of House Stark.

==Geography==
The borders of the North are held to be the [[Sunset Sea]] to the west and the [[Shivering Sea]] to the east, the [[Wall]] to the north and the hills and bogs of the [[Neck]] to the south. [[Greywater Watch]] and its ruling [[Noble house|house]], [[House Reed]], are the southernmost noble family owing fealty to Winterfell. Likewise, [[Last Hearth]] and its ruling House, [[House Umber]], are the northernmost noble family sworn to Winterfell. Beyond Last Hearth comes the lands of the [[Gift]] under the control of the politically neutral [[Night's Watch]] and eventually the Wall itself.

In the northwestern coast of the North is the large [[Bay of Ice]] in the Sunset Sea. [[Bear Island]], the seat of [[House Mormont]], is in the central portion of the bay. The southern coast of the Bay of Ice is just north of the large forested [[Wolfswood]]. The peninsula [[Sea Dragon Point]] is surrounded by the bay. In the northeastern coast of the North lies the [[Bay of Seals]] in the Shivering Sea. The large and remote [[Skagos]] and the smaller [[Skane]] are both in the bay as part of an island group all considered parts of the North.

The climate and biomes of the North, though harsh overall, varies from cool and swampy around the Neck, to moderate tundra around Winterfell, and to subarctic at the Wall. The lands south of Winterfell leading to the Neck are almost as fertile as the [[Riverlands]] to the south, and are the most agriculturally productive region of the North. The Neck itself is filled with swamps. Snowfall generally increases as one moves north along the [[Kingsroad]].

==Military strength==
[[File:Robb-stark-richard-madden-helen-sloan.jpeg|thumb|Robb Stark's Northern armor.]]
Northerner soldiers are renowned of being fierce warriors.<ref>"[[The Night Lands]]"</ref> In comparison to soldiers from the other six kingdoms, Northern soldiers are easily distinguishable by their heavy usage of leather armor and uniforms. For instance, [[House Stark|Stark]] soldiers wear studded leather over their mail and padding, while [[House Bolton|Bolton]] soldiers were equipped with boiled leather tunics over chain mail, and [[House Mormont|Mormont]] soldiers equip themselves with leather jerkins. Due to The North not being as wealthy as the other regions, steel plate armor is rare with only a few Houses, like [[House Glover]], being able to afford it. However, some nobles can afford many plate armor parts, like [[Robb Stark]], and in rare occasions whole suits of expensive plate, like [[Jorah Mormont]]. 

Due to the North's vast size, gathering the full military strength of the Starks and their vassals is a difficult process, requiring months of travel time and the ability to supply and feed the host even before it sets out.

For this reason, the 18,000 men<ref>"[[The Pointy End]]"</ref> Robb Stark takes south to confront the army of the [[Westerlands]] is not the full strength of the North, only what could be assembled at relatively short notice. The forces left to guard were unknown, but main castles like [[Winterfell]] and [[Dreadfort]] were able to rise a few hundreds men with ease.<ref>"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"</ref><ref>"[[Valar Morghulis]]"</ref>

By the time of the [[battle at the Yellow Fork]], the Stark army is allied with [[House Tully]] and their vassals, including [[House Frey]], making its numbers comparable to or even greater than the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army at the time.

During the [[Red Wedding]], almost the entire Northern army present at the [[Twins]] is annihilated, with anyone who manages to escape the massacre being hunted by [[House Frey]]. While Houses [[House Bolton|Bolton]] and [[House Karstark|Karstark]] remain mostly unscathed and represent half of the manpower in the North with the [[House Umber|Umbers]], the only possibility of military support to the scattered heirs of House Stark comes from the remaining garrison and levies of other northern houses, provided they do not bend the knee to the new [[Warden of the North]], [[Roose Bolton]].

During the [[conflict beyond the Wall]], Jon establishes an alliance between the Night's Watch and at least 2,000 Free Folk. With his temporary death freeing him from his vows, and the wildlings still loyal to him, the wildlings are now unofficial Northern soldiers. Jon and Sansa convince some of the smaller houses to unite around them, giving them 2,405 men.<ref>"[[The Broken Man]]"</ref> During the [[Battle of the Bastards]], the Starks and their allies came close to total destruction; they were saved by the intervention of a sizable army from the [[Vale of Arryn]] led by Sansa and [[Petyr Baelish]].

Shortly after the Battle of the Bastards, Jon and Sansa treat with all the Northern Lords and the Lords of the Vale. [[Lyanna Mormont]] declares Jon the King in the North and is soon followed by [[Wyman Manderly]], [[Robett Glover]], [[Cley Cerwyn]] and the rest of the Northern Lords.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

At Dragonstone, Jon laments to Davos that the entire combined strength of arms in the North at this point (including old men and green boys) is probably fewer than 10,000 men. While it is not specified, it is possible that the North possesses several ships, as Jon uses one for his voyage from White Harbor to Dragonstone.<ref>"[[The Spoils of War]]"</ref>
[[File:Battle of the Bastards 20.jpg|thumb|Northern army during [[Battle of the Bastards]].]]
During the [[Battle of Winterfell]], half of the Northern army is obliterated.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref> The Northern forces later partake in the [[Battle of King's Landing]] alongside the Vale and Targaryen troops, apparently not taking significant losses.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the North is an area vast in size but relatively light in population. The North, due to its location, is particularly badly affected during the long winters, with thousands of people killed and famine not an uncommon occurrence due to the inability to raise crops for years on end, outside of special greenhouses and castles built on or near hot springs, like Winterfell, or volcanic vents, like the Dreadfort of House Bolton.

The people of the North, popularly called "northmen" or "northerners", are known as a hardy, tough breed who hold the comforts of the warm, "soft" south in disdain. They worship the old gods, and the "new gods" of the Andals have made little headway in the North. With a few exceptions, the warriors of the North refuse to take holy orders and thus cannot become [[Knighthood|knights]].

Some of the northmen live in remote, distant areas where they act little more as clans and tribes of savage warriors. Even these remote folk are vassals of the Starks, however, and are allowed to maintain their own ways and traditions as long as they remain loyal to Winterfell - which most of them usually do, as the Starks have a history of being just and honorable rulers. The Starks treated the mountain clans with respect by referring to them as if they were small-scale noble houses, i.e. calling them "House Wull" and "House Norrey", instead of dismissively thinking of them as lowly "clans".

Characters in the novels frequently remark that the North is almost as large as the rest of the Seven Kingdoms put together (a remark repeated in the TV series).  In the ''World of Ice and Fire'' sourcebook (2014), the in-universe author Maester Yandel explains that while this is a very common saying, [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] have conducted fairly accurate land surveys over the centuries, which have revealed that the North is actually closer to about one third of the total land area of the Seven Kingdoms, not one half.
