{{Quote|To steward his monument to vanity, Baelor summoned the High Septon of the Faith from his ancient seat in Oldtown and gifted him with ornate robes and a crown of crystal and gold, and like a fool the High Septon put on his lord's motley and danced at his lord's table, and with each passing year the High Septons fell ever lower. |[[High Sparrow]]|Great Sept of Baelor (short)}}
