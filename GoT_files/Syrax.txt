==Biography==
===Background===
Syrax is a yellow green-eyed dragon ridden by Rhaenyra Targaryen.<ref>[https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon ''House of the Dragon'' | Official Website for the HBO Series | HBO.com]</ref> She is named after the [[Old Gods of Valyria|Valyrian]] goddess [[Syrax (goddess)|Syrax]].{{Guideref|Syrax}} Years ago, Rhaenyra carved the [[High Valyrian glyphs]] for "we are fire made flesh" and "fire and blood" into the horns on Syrax's left side.{{Webref |author=@FoundryTeam |date=August 15, 2024 |url=https://youtu.be/Iq49IdKZJOo?si=wStIPvbZsJg0w3bd&t=756 |title=Texturing lessons from House of the Dragon - FMX 2024 (at 12:36) |website=YouTube |access-date= September 25, 2024}}{{Webref |author=Bob Makela |date=July 3, 2023 |url=https://www.emmys.com/news/mix/enter-dragons |title=Enter the Dragons |website=Emmys.com |access-date= September 25, 2024}}{{Webref |author=@Gugardo__ |date=August 17, 2024 |url=https://x.com/Gugardo__/status/1824950251528065288 |title="Better here  from S1 episode 2" |website=X |access-date= September 25, 2024}}{{Ref|HOTD102}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Rhaenyra rides Syrax on a morning flight around [[King's Landing]] before their return to the entrance of the [[Dragonpit]]. As Rhaenyra departs for the [[Red Keep]], the [[Dragonkeepers]] escort Syrax into the Dragonpit. Several days later, Rhaenyra commands Syrax to cremate the bodies of Queen [[Aemma Arryn]] and Prince [[Baelon Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}
[[File:TRP Syrax.jpg|thumb|Flying to Dragonstone to end conflict.]]
When Rhaenyra learns that her uncle Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] stole the dragon egg that was meant for her brother Baelon, she rides Syrax to [[Dragonstone]] and successfully retrieves the egg without inflicting a single casualty before returning to King's Landing.{{Ref|HOTD102}}

As a gesture of renewed friendship, Rhaenyra offers to give one of Syrax's eggs to [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s son [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

During the funeral of [[Laena Velaryon]], Syrax stays at [[High Tide]] along with several other dragons, flying overhead alongside [[Caraxes]] and [[Meleys]] while [[Dreamfyre]] and [[Sunfyre]] sit on the cliffside.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Daemon enters [[Dragonmont]] to retrieve eggs laid by Syrax. He returns with three eggs in total.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Syrax is able to feel the pain of Rhaenyra when the latter miscarried her daughter [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]]. When [[Otto Hightower]] and his guards arrive on Dragonstone to demand Rhaenyra's, Rhaenyra rides Syrax to intimidate them before flying off.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:S2 Dragon.png|thumb|Flying over [[Shipbreaker Bay|Shipbreaker Bay.]]]]
[[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] arrives at the [[Stormlands]] on Syrax as they gaze upon [[Storm's End]] and [[Shipbreaker Bay]] in search of [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] and [[Arrax]]. They eventually discover one of Arrax's wings which had been brought to shore by a group of fishermen. Syrax lets out a mournful roar as Rhaenyra grieves Lucerys's death. Syrax eventually flies Rhaenyra back to the [[Dragonstone]] gantry.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Rhaenyra flies Syrax from Dragonstone gantry to [[Driftmark]] after Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]] informed her that [[Seasmoke]] has found a rider.{{Ref|HOTD206}}
[[File:2x7 Rhaenyra Targaryen Still 2.jpg|thumb|Rhaenyra and Syrax following the Red Sowing.]]
Syrax and Seasmoke call to each other as Rhaenyra and [[Addam of Hull]] converse before flying back to to Dragonstone together. 

Syrax later roars alongside [[Vermithor]] and [[Silverwing]] to deter [[Vhagar]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] from attacking.{{Ref|HOTD207}}
[[File:S2 Rhaenyra on Syrax.png|thumb|Rhaenyra fly on Syrax to Harrenhal.]]
Syrax and Seasmoke fly Rhaenyra and Addam to Harrenhal before landing on the roof of the Hall of One Hundred Hearths, where the lords of the [[Riverlands]] swear fealty to her.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
Syrax had yellow scales, and by the [[Dance of the Dragons]] she had grown huge and formidable - though not as fearsome or experienced in battle as [[Caraxes]]. While Rhaenyra enjoyed flying in her youth, as an adult she kept Syrax restrained on Dragonstone. By the time the civil war began she had not hunted for years, but was very well fed. 

Rhaenyra first took Syrax as a mount in 104 AC, when the princess was seven years old. Syrax was described as a "young" dragon at the time, and Rhaenyra herself named her "Syrax" (after a [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] goddess) - strongly implying that Syrax had no previous rider.

''[[Fire & Blood]]'' simply didn't state the lineage of the twenty Targaryen dragons alive at the beginning of the civil war, so it's unclear which ones were Syrax's parents. However, Rhaenyra's dragon is the only one specifically described as laying eggs: she laid "several" clutches during the reign of her father [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]. Syrax's latest clutch was produced just prior to the civil war, one of which was given to Daemon's daughter Rhaena.
