The '''Blackwater Rush''',{{Ref|H&L204}} also called the '''Blackwater'''{{Ref|GOT308}} or '''Blackwater River''',{{Cite}} is a significant river of [[Westeros]]. It flows out of the hills and valleys of the [[Westerlands]] and proceeds eastwards for several hundred miles before flowing into [[Blackwater Bay]]. The city of [[King's Landing]] overlooks the mouth of the Blackwater. A tributary of the Blackwater drains the lake of [[Gods Eye]] to the north.

The town of [[Stoney Sept]] is located not far from its headwaters.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Blackwater forms the boundary between the [[Crownlands]], [[Westerlands]], [[Reach]], and [[Riverlands]]. [[King's Landing]], the capital city of the Seven Kingdoms, is built on the mouth of the Blackwater where it enters Blackwater Bay.
