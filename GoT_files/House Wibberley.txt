'''House Wibberley'''{{Ref|GOT504}}{{Note|Lord Wibberley's surname is Wibberley.}} is a [[noble house]] from [[Westeros]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] presents some paperwork to Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]], consisting of requests to various noble houses to send new recruits to the [[Night's Watch]]. A few Houses can spare any men during the [[War of the Five Kings]], so the Watch is left scraping the bottom of the barrel: the requests are mostly to minor lords that Jon says he hasn't even heard of, including Lord Wibberley.{{Ref|GOT504}}

==Members==
*[[Lord Wibberley]], head of the house.

==Behind the scenes==
The House names mentioned in "Sons of the Harpy" are in-joke references to friends of the TV writers: "[[House Caulfield]]" (specifically "Lady Caulfield") for [[Bernadette Caulfield]], a producer on the TV show; "[[House Mazin]]" refers to Craig Mazin, a fellow scriptwriter who gave the showrunners advice on the unscreened [[Pilot (Game of Thrones)|pilot]]; similarly, "House Wibberley" is a reference to Cormac and Marianne Wibberley, a married team of scriptwriters who are also friends of the TV show writers.<ref>[https://twitter.com/clmazin/status/720763097967755265 Craig Mazin Twitter]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of any House Wibberley. The episode itself makes a joke about this when Jon Snow remarks that he has "never even heard of these people".
