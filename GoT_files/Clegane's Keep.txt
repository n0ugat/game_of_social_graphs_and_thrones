'''Clegane's Keep''',{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} or '''Clegane Keep''',{{Ref|THTDB201}} is a castle in the [[Westerlands]]. It is the seat of [[House Clegane]], a knightly house holding fealty to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. The castle is located south-east of Casterly Rock in the heart of the [[Westerlands]].

It was awarded to [[Gregor Clegane's grandfather]], formerly a kennelmaster at Casterly Rock, for saving Lord [[Tytos Lannister]] from a [[lion]]ess attack.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the location of Clegane's Keep has not been revealed. However, according to [[George R.R. Martin]] it does lie in the approximate same location as the TV series, south-east of Casterly Rock.
