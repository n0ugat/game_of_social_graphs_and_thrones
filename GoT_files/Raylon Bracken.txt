In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Raylon Bracken and it is not stated that Amos Bracken had a son, but Amos did have a [[bastard]] half-brother named Raylon Rivers. It was Raylon who led the survivors of the Burning Mill back to Stone Hedge, which had been taken by Daemon in the meantime. Since Lord Humfrey and his family were hostages of Daemon, Raylon surrendered.
