'''Dean-Charles Chapman''' is an English film, stage and television actor best known for his roles in ''Billy Elliot''; appearing in both the original London performance, and later taking over the lead role in the 2009 revival.

==''Game of Thrones''==
He was cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]] of ''Game of Thrones'' in the role of [[Martyn Lannister]].<ref>http://winteriscoming.net/2013/02/dean-charles-chapman-joins-the-cast/</ref><ref>http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Dean_Charles_Chapman_in_Season_3</ref> Chapman has returned for [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]], playing the role of [[Tommen Baratheon]].

In an interview with the ''Game of Owns'' podcast two weeks after "[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]" aired, writer [[Bryan Cogman]] stated that Tommen was recast in Season 4 because he becomes the new king, which meant a lot more heavy acting rested on the character, so they wanted a more experienced actor. He also confirmed that they ''did not'' cast Dean-Charles Chapman as Tommen's first cousin Martyn Lannister in Season 3 to somehow set him up as the new, older Tommen (Martyn and Tommen are related, so logically, an older Tommen might resemble his older cousin). Rather, Chapman was cast simply to play Martyn in Season 3, and after Martyn was killed Chapman thought his time working on the TV series was over. Chapman was only called back to the TV series after the production team had decided to recast Tommen in Season 4 (it isn't clear if he had to audition or was hand-picked).<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/05/14/game-owns-bryan-cogman-returns/ ''Game of Owns'' Episode 219:  Bryan Cogman returns]</ref>

Speaking with ''Vulture.com'' at the Season 4 premiere party, Chapman was surprised to discover that his character was next in line for the [[Iron Throne]]: "I was like, ''Whoa!''" he said. "I know it sounds silly, but I hadn't read the scripts, and I didn't know what had happened. And then I flew over to Belfast so they could dress me for wardrobe, and the lady said, 'Okay, let's get your crown on.' And I was like, 'Crown?' 'Yeah, you know, you're going to be king!' So I just stood there, looking in the mirror, with this thing on my head, stunned."<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2014/04/whats-the-succession-plan-on-game-of-thrones.html ]</ref>

Chapman's natural speaking voice actually has an Essex accent: the Received Pronunciation accent he adopts to play Tommen is a conscious part of his performance.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/39270/game-of-thrones-season-5-what-we-learned-from-the-blu-rays Season 5 Blu-ray commentary]</ref>
