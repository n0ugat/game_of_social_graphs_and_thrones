In summer 2017, HBO announced that five separate prequel pitches were under consideration, none of which were ultimately greenlit. One was about Aegon's Conquest by [[Rand Ravich]] and [[Far Shariat]]. Their script portrayed [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] as "a drunken lout," and was one of the first pitches rejected by [[HBO]].<ref name="THR" />

On February 9, 2024, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' revealed that [[Mattson Tomlin]] was attached to a new [[Aegon's Conquest (Mattson Tomlin)|Aegon's Conquest project]].{{Webref|name=Tomlin |author=James Hibberd, Borys Kit |date=February 8, 2024 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/game-of-thrones-spinoff-aegons-conquest-mattson-tomlin-1235792104/ |title=‘Game of Thrones’ Aegon’s Conquest Spinoff in the Works From ‘The Batman Part II’ Writer (Exclusive) |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=February 9, 2024 }}
