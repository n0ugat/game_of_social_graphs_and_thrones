{{Quote|But if diseases could be called down by the vengeful, we would have no health in the world. More likely the disease predates the Valyrians entirely, confined to some remote region of Essos and only spread throughout the world once the Valyrians linked the continent with roads and dragons.|[[Qyburn]]|Greyscale and the Stone Men}}
The '''Valyrian roads'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} were roads which linked the continent of [[Essos]].<ref>"[[Greyscale and the Stone Men]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Valyrian roads (also known as the "dragon roads") are broad stone highways that were built when the [[Valyrians]] ruled [[Essos]]. The roads are straight and usually connect economic centers, which allows for swift transport of goods.

The roads covered most of the [[Valyrian peninsula]] and connect locations such as [[Volantis]], [[Tyria]] and [[Oros]], [[Mantarys]], [[Tolos]], the [[Black Cliffs]], [[Sar Mell]], [[Pentos]], [[Norvos]], [[Qohor]], and Ar Noy. The roads are featured in [[Lomas Longstrider]]'s book ''[[Wonders Made by Man]]''.

Valyrian roads are inspired by Roman roads. Although they were built by men and not dragons, the Roman roads were built using comparatively advanced engineering and realized by using armies as a workforce. Like Valyria's roads, Roman roads linked various parts of the Empire to Rome itself and were so well constructed that they were used for centuries after Rome's decline, leading to the irreverent saying "all roads lead to Rome."
