==''Game of Thrones''==
Turner was cast as Sansa Stark when she was 13 years old when a nation-wide talent search canvassed her school in rural Warwickshire, England. She continued to live at her parents' home during the filming of the earlier seasons of the TV series; alternating between six months of filming and six months at home. By Season 6 she bought an apartment in London, but she said she's only stayed there for a total of maybe two weeks, as a stop-over point when she is traveling for public appearances or to use the airport.

Regarding her character, Turner said in ''The Sunday Times'' before the Season 4 premiere:

:"She's relatable to because she’s such a realistic character...I think she’s like young girls today — they read magazines, they look at models, they’ve got social media telling them how to act. That's who Sansa is. She's looked at the queen, she's looked at Margaery Tyrell, and she idolizes them. All she wants is to become them. She’s like every 12-year-old girl who wants to be a celebrity — it's the same adolescence as everyone else, but a few hundred years ago. In an alternative universe. With dragons."<ref>[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/film_and_tv/article1389051.ece], [http://fyeahsophieturner.tumblr.com/post/80500246728/sophie-turner-interviewed-in-the-sunday-times-complete]</ref>

Turner actually has "naturally baby blonde hair", so her hair had to be dyed for Sansa's auburn hair.<ref>[http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed#3]</ref> The Starks have black hair, while the Tullys have auburn hair, and Sansa is stated in the books to take after her mother Catelyn Tully in appearance. When Sansa flees to the Vale with Littlefinger, she dyes her hair black to hide her true identity (corresponding to the end of Season 4 in the TV series).

On January 23, 2015, it was confirmed by director Bryan Singer that Sophie would appear in ''X-Men: Apocalypse'' (which is set in the 1980s) as young Jean Grey.<ref>http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/x_men_apocalypse/news/1932631/weekly_ketchup_x-men_apocalypse_finds_its_jean_grey_storm_and_cyclops/</ref> Turner later speculated that the "Dark Sansa" persona played a role in her casting.<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/10/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-says-she-was-cast-as-jean-grey-in-x-men-thanks-to-dark-sansa</ref>
