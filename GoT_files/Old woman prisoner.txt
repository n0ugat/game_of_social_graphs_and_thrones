{{Quote|He's dead. He was my son. My sister was three days ago. My husband the day before that.|Old woman prisoner|Garden of Bones (episode)}}
An '''old woman prisoner''' was a prisoner of [[Harrenhal]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
She is captured by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] and imprisoned in [[Harrenhal]] with her family. Her sister, husband and son are tortured to death by the [[Tickler]] at Harrenhal.{{Ref|GOT204}}

[[Polliver]] beats her for asking for a crust of bread.{{Ref|GOT204}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, among the captives that [[Gregor Clegane]] takes to Harrenhal there is a wizened old woman. [[Arya Stark]] overhears her complaining one night "It's not just, it's not. We never did no treason, [[Brotherhood Without Banners|the others]] come in and took what they wanted, same as this bunch." Her friend disagrees, saying "[[Beric Dondarrion|Lord Beric]] did us no hurt, though, and that [[Thoros|red priest]] with him, he paid for all they took". The old woman answers disdainfully "Paid? He took two of my chickens and gave me a bit of paper with a mark on it. Can I eat a bit of raggy old paper, I ask you? Will it give me eggs?". She looks about to see that no guards were near, and spits three times. "There's for the [[House Tully|Tullys]] and there's for the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and there's for the [[House Stark|Starks]]."

The old woman is not mentioned afterwards.
