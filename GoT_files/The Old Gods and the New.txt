==Synopsis==
===At Winterfell===
[[File:TheonApproachesBran.png|thumb|Theon approaches Bran, then takes over Winterfell.]]
At [[Winterfell]], [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] frantically sends off a messenger [[raven]]. A band of raiders from [[House Greyjoy]], led by [[Theon Greyjoy]], take over the undefended castle. Theon had lured the defenders away with a feint at [[Torrhen's Square]] and then infiltrated the castle using grappling claws. Theon tells [[Bran Stark]] to surrender the castle to him to save his people. Bran submits in front of his assembled people. Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] is captured by Theon's men as he is returning from Torrhen's Square. He spits in Theon's face, and [[Dagmer]] insists that Theon must kill him, or lose face in front of his [[Ironborn]] raiders. Theon botches the beheading of Ser Rodrik, requiring several hacks and a kick, horrifying the people of Winterfell. Later that night, [[Osha]] the [[Free Folk|wildling]] woman has sex with Theon, but then sneaks out of his room while he is asleep. Osha frees Bran, [[Rickon Stark]], [[Hodor]], and their [[Direwolf|direwolves]] ([[Summer]] and [[Shaggydog]]). She smuggles them out of the castle and kills [[Drennan|one]] of Theon's guards in the process.

=== In the Westerlands ===
At King [[Robb Stark]]'s army camp, Robb chats with [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]], who has followed his forces on their campaign. Robb introduces Talisa to his mother [[Catelyn Stark]], who has returned from the [[Stormlands]] along with [[Brienne of Tarth]]. They are interrupted when Lord [[Roose Bolton]] arrives with the terrible news sent by Luwin's last messenger raven. Furious at Theon's betrayal, Robb intends to march his army back to the North to repel the invasion. Roose advises that the few hundred soldiers left scattered in the North can be rallied by his bastard son, [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]], who is in the North at the [[Dreadfort]]. They could overcome the small Ironborn invasion force. Roose warns that retreating the entire Northern army group would lose everything they have gained. Robb agrees, but insists that Bolton's men take Theon alive so Robb can look him in the eyes and ask "Why?" before personally executing him.

=== At Harrenhal ===
At [[Harrenhal]], the main base camp for the [[House Lannister]] army in the Riverlands, Tywin Lannister berates Ser [[Amory Lorch]] for delivering a letter to their enemies instead of their allies, because he cannot read properly. He discovers that his [[cupbearer]] "Arry" (secretly [[Arya Stark]]) can read. 
[[Petyr Baelish|Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish]] arrives at camp and meets with Tywin. Arya tries to hide her face to prevent Littlefinger from identifying her. Baelish discusses the assassination of [[Renly Baratheon]] and the subsequent rallying of the noble Houses from the [[Stormlands]] under the banner of his older brother [[Stannis Baratheon]]. However, [[House Tyrell]] of the [[Reach]] has retreated its large army back to their capital at [[Highgarden]], and has not joined Stannis. Baelish discusses with Tywin the possibility of forming an alliance between House Lannister and House Tyrell.

Later, Tywin questions Arya about her origins. While Tywin is distracted, Arya sees that a letter on his table is about her older brother Robb Stark, so she snatches it. After she asks Tywin about his own father, Tywin sends her to fetch more firewood. She takes this opportunity to read the letter, but unfortunately bumps into Amory Lorch who sees that she is carrying the letter and grows suspicious. Arya runs away and Amory heads to tell Tywin. Arya runs to find [[Jaqen H'ghar]], telling him that Amory Lorch is the second name he owes her, and it must be now. Just as Amory Lorch reaches Tywin's quarters, he falls down dead with a poisoned dart lodged in his neck.

=== In King's Landing ===
The royal court including King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]], Prince [[Tommen Baratheon]], and [[Sansa Stark]] are at the docks seeing off Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]] as she departs in a ship bound for [[Dorne]]. Cersei is heartbroken and warns Tyrion that she will not forgive him for sending away her only daughter.

As per Tyrion's plans, Myrcella will stay in Dorne with [[House Martell]] until she comes of age to fulfill the marriage alliance to their youngest son, [[Trystane Martell]]. The [[High Septon (Joffrey)|High Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]] offers a blessing for her departure. The streets of the capital city are overflowing with starving refugees from the [[War of the Five Kings]], as Cersei ignored both Tyrion and Janos Slynt's earlier warnings that something had to be done to care for the starving [[smallfolk|peasants]] or there would be mounting discontent with her son's rule.[[File:JoffreyAttackedSeason2.png|thumb|Joffrey has excrement thrown on him by rioting peasants.]] As the royal party travels back to the [[Red Keep]] through the crowded streets, the starving refugees and commoners of King's Landing plead for bread and hurl insults at King Joffrey, and ultimately, someone throws cow excrement into Joffrey's face. Despite being accompanied by only a few dozen guards facing hundreds of peasants, Joffrey impetuously orders his soldiers to kill the entire crowd. 
[[File:SansaAlmostRapedSeason2.png|thumb|Sansa is almost raped.]]
[[Riots in King's Landing|Riots]] subsequently erupt and spread throughout the city. The royal party's guards are soon overwhelmed, and Joffrey, Cersei and Tyrion barely make it back to the castle unscathed. The High Septon is literally torn apart by the mob.

[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is enraged by Joffrey's shocking stupidity, for massively overreacting to having cow dung thrown at him, and for not realizing that his orders would cause a riot among the starving peasants and endanger the entire royal party. Joffrey, still manically cursing the mob and demanding they all be killed, shrieks that Tyrion cannot speak to him in that way and petulantly reminds his uncle that he is talking to a king. Tyrion then contemptuously slaps his nephew across the face, sarcastically asking if his hand fell from his wrist, but Joffrey does not retaliate. The scant two thousand [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] guards have difficulty containing the riot, and chaos reigns throughout the city. Tyrion realizes to his horror that Sansa Stark was lost in the crowd. Joffrey petulantly refuses to send his men after her, even after Tyrion points out her importance as a [[hostage]] or the fact that if any harm comes to her, the Starks may retaliate by executing his uncle [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. Outside, Sansa is dragged away by a mob of angry men and is about to be raped, when [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor "The Hound" Clegane]] arrives and slays her assailants. He carries Sansa to the castle and orders handmaids to take care of her. Tyrion thanks him for saving Sansa's life, but Sandor bluntly responds that he didn't do it for him.

===Beyond the Wall===
[[File:YgritteSeason5.png|thumb|Jon first lays eyes on [[Ygritte]].]]
The scouting party of the [[Night's Watch]] led by [[Qhorin]] has left the expeditionary base, their main force set up at the [[Fist of the First Men]], and continues searching for the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] in the [[Frostfangs]] mountain range. They encounter a small group of wildling scouts and engage them in combat, killing all except one: a red-haired young woman named [[Ygritte]]. Qhorin orders [[Jon Snow]] to execute her while the rest of them continue on up the mountain. Jon hesitates, giving Ygritte enough time to make a run for it. Jon pursues and captures Ygritte, but they have become separated from Qhorin's scouting party. With darkness falling, Jon and his prisoner have to settle in for the night, hoping to link back up with Qhorin when daylight returns.

=== In Qarth ===
[[File:DanyDiscoversDeadPeopleSeason2.png|thumb|Daenerys discovers that her guards have been slain and her dragons are missing.]]
In [[Qarth]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] tries to negotiate with the [[Spice King]] for ships to return to [[Westeros]]. However, he considers it to be too risky an investment – considering that she has no army and has no open supporters in Westeros – and she receives nothing. Returning with [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] to his mansion, Daenerys finds her guards dead, [[Irri]] strangled to death, and her [[dragon]]s missing. A hooded figure carries the dragons in a covered box up steps towards a tower.

==Behind the scenes==
*The title refers to the [[Old Gods]] worshiped primarily in the [[North]] and the Seven of the [[Faith of the Seven]], also referred to as the new gods. In the series their oaths featured in the preceding episode "[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]."
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys's theme]]. It did not appear on the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2 (Music from the HBO Series)|official soundtrack release]].
*The episode won a [[wikipedia:Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Make-Up (Non-Prosthetic) in September 2012<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/ Westeros.org]</ref>.
*When Tyrion admonishes Joffrey that if Sansa dies the Starks will kill his captive "uncle" Jaime, saying "You owe him quite a bit, you know!". This is a callback to the Season 2 premiere, "[[The North Remembers]]," in which Joffrey told Cersei that he'd heard of the "rumors" being spread by Stannis that Joffrey is really Jaime's bastard son; he just refused to believe they could be true. Joffrey scowls at Tyrion's insinuation about his relationship to Jaime.
* The first time that Sansa is called "little bird." Sandor "the Hound" Clegane is the only character who calls her by that nickname.
*The scenes depicting Jon and Qhorin beyond the Wall are filmed on-location in Iceland. The frozen landscape and glaciers in the background are real, not CGI or a matte painting.
*[[File:LetterFromTheOldGodsAndTheNew.jpg|thumb|right|Composite screenshot of Arya's letter]]Screenshots reveal<ref>[http://wicnet.tumblr.com/post/22725243446]</ref> that the letter on troop movements in the war that Arya steals from Tywin's desk reads: ''"Marching ten thousand west to Lannisport through the Tooth ([[Golden Tooth]]). Estimate to reach you by week's end. Scouts report Robb Stark moving troops south by coast. Alert Serrett he should turn east at Silverhill."'' [[House Serrett]] are the lords of [[Silverhill]], located in the southern Westerlands, south-east of Lannisport.
*[[Irri]] does not die in the books. It was reported that this was not a creative choice but forced, because actress [[Amrita Acharia]] had to leave production due to not being able to obtain Norwegian citizenship (even though most of her family has it), and thus not being able to extend her EU work visa.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/05/curtain-call-amrita-acharia/ WinterIsCominet.net report] on Amrita Acharia's departure</ref> However, Acharia denied this false rumor in a Reddit AMA, calling it "completely wrong" and stating that she does have Norwegian citizenship, and that there were no visa issues.<ref>[http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/uuiw2/amrita_acharia_portrayed_irri_on_game_of/c4yprh0 Reddit]</ref>[[File:Doreah kills Irri.jpg|thumb|Deleted scene of Doreah killing Irri.]]
**According an interview Amrita Acharia gave after this episode aired, a death scene for Irri was actually filmed but was not included in the final edit of the episode: "I’m waiting for Daenerys to come back so I’m running up the stairs. “Khaleesi, are you back yet?” And the dragons are gone. Out of nowhere, there’s a noose around my neck. I think it’s hard to be strangled on screen because obviously to an extent to make it look real, you really have to be a bit strangled. So I had massive bruises on my neck the next day. I was proud. Battle scars. Death scenes are fun."<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/05/interview-with-amrita-acharia/ WinterIsComing.net interview with Amrita Acharia]</ref> Acharia also pointed out that the Daenerys/Irri sex scene which occurred in the third novel will now never happen.
**An image from a deleted scene later surfaced revealing that it was actually Doreah who personally strangled Irri to death, instead of just indirectly betraying her to her death. As this is from a deleted scene it is not canonical and should not be considered to have actually happened.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/10/doreah-kills-irri-new-s2-production-stills/%7C WinterIsComing.net report.]</ref>
**In "[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]" Balon Greyjoy orders Yara to seize [[Deepwood Motte]]. Although it is not explicitly mentioned in the show, Theon's order to Luwin in this episode "send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here and one to Deepwood Motte to my sister" confirms that Yara has [[Attack on Deepwood Motte|accomplished the mission]] off-screen; it is unclear, though, whether it occurred before or after Theon [[Capture of Winterfell|seized Winterfell]], and no other details are given about it.
***Similarly, the [[Fall of Moat Cailin|capture of Moat Cailin]] by the Ironborn also happens off-screen at unknown point of the plotline, and without specific details. In contrast to Deepwood Motte, Balon does not give anyone specific orders (at least not on-screen) to seize Moat Cailin, and there is no mentioning in the show that it has been captured till Season 4's episode "[[The Lion and the Rose]]"; the only source of information of that military action is the Season 2 Blu-ray: War of the Five Kings feature.
*Upon receiving the bad news about the capture of Winterfell and Ser Rodrik's death, Catelyn exclaims: "I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!". Catelyn never said that: in "[[The North Remembers]]" she told Robb that Balon Greyjoy was untrustworthy; she did not tell Robb that he should not trust Theon or the Greyjoys in general.
*Roose's statement "the Greyjoys are treasonous whores" is rather ironic due to the [[Red Wedding]].
*Tyrion strikes Joffrey, then says sarcastically: "Now I've struck a king. Did my hand fall from my wrist?" According to the novels, in the Targaryen era, a person who struck one of the blood royal would lose his hand; [[Oberyn Martell]] mentions this at [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion's court trial]].{{Bookref|ASOS|66}}
