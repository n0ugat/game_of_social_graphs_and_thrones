'''Margaret Constance Williams''' (born 15 April 1997) is an English actress making her television debut in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', where she plays the role of [[Arya Stark]]. She was part of the initial starring cast and remains a member of the starring cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|eighth season]].

==Career==
Maisie is right-handed, but plays Arya as left-handed, as in the novels.

Maisie's home village is Clutton, in Somerset. The audition day for ''Game of Thrones'' was the same day that her school was having a field trip to a local pig farm - she nearly skipped the audition because she really wanted to see the pig farm (and didn't think she'd get the part anyway), but ultimately decided to go to the audition.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-wiltshire-27986285 ]</ref>

Williams has not read the books, but has read summaries of what happens to Arya in later books. She stated that she chose not to read the books because the TV adaptation abbreviates a large amount of material, and she was worried that she would get confused, basing her reactions on points from the books which don't exist for Arya in the TV version.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/first-official-clip-of-arya-from-season-5/ ]</ref>

On May 11th, 2017, it was announced that Williams will be playing Wolfsbane in the next installment in the ''X-Men'' movie franchise, ''New Mutants''. Wolfsbane is a mutant with the power to turn into a werewolf (so she's still playing a "wolf girl" in a sense after ''Game of Thrones'').<ref>[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/x-men-new-mutants-movie-casts-anya-taylor-joy-maisie-williams-1002743 ]</ref> Williams joins her on-screen sister [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]) in the ''X-Men'' universe, after Turner was cast as young Jean Grey (a telepath) in ''X-Men: Apocalypse''.
