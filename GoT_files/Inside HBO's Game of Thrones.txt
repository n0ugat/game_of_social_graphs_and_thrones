'''''Inside HBO's Game of Thrones''''' is a companion book about the ''Game of Thrones'' TV series adaptation produced by [[HBO]]. It was published by Chronicle Books in the USA on 19 September 2012 and by Gollancz in the UK on 27 September 2012.<ref>June 2012. [http://www.gollancz.co.uk/2012/06/gollancz-goes-inside-game-of-thrones/ "Gollancz Goes Inside 'Game of Thrones'"]. Gollancz.co.uk.</ref>

The book is written by [[Bryan Cogman]], who has also written two episodes of the series and serves as "keeper of the mythos" for the production. The book has an introduction by showrunners [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]], and a preface by [[George R.R. Martin]]. As the official companion book to the series, information presented in this volume is treated as canon by this Wiki, unless contradicted by in-episode information.

The book contains in-universe material, such as family trees and maps, and behind-the-scenes sections, including interviews with cast and crew. It is 192 pages long and features more than 300 color photographs and illustrations, as well as eight gatefold sections.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Official_HBO_Game_of_Thrones_Companion_Book_Announced/ "Offical HBO 'Game of Thrones' Companion Book Announced"]. Westeros.org.</ref>

The book covers information from [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] and [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]]. It was published about six months before [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]] premiered, so it contains no information on subsequent TV seasons. A sequel book is due by Christmas 2014, ''[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones: Seasons 3 & 4]]''.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2014/01/hbo-announces-new-inside-game-of-thrones-book/ ]</ref>
