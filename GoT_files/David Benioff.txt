He is best known for his novels ''[[wikipedia:The 25th Hour|The 25th Hour]]'' and ''City of Thieves'', and his role as scriptwriter on [[wikipedia:Spike Lee|Spike Lee]]'s adaptation of his novel as ''[[wikipedia:25th Hour|25th Hour]]'' and also on ''[[wikipedia:Troy (film)|Troy]]'', ''[[wikipedia:The Kite Runner (film)|The Kite Runner]]'', ''[[wikipedia:X-Men Origins: Wolverine|X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'', and ''[[wikipedia: Brothers (2009 film)|Brothers]]''.

David Benioff was given the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire|A&nbsp;Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels as a gift and became a big fan of the books. On 16 January 2007 [[HBO]] optioned the rights to the books and Benioff and writing partner [[D.B. Weiss]] began developing the project as a pilot script entitled ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The two writers appeared with [[George R.R. Martin]] at an appearance on social networking site ''[[wikipedia:Second Life|Second Life]]'' on 31 May 2007 to discuss the project with fans. On 9 September 2008 HBO exercised their option to buy the rights and ordered a pilot on 11 November, with Benioff and Weiss appointed as executive producers and showrunners of the project.

On ''Game of Thrones'' Benioff works as executive producer, showrunner and scriptwriter. Together with D.B. Weiss he has written the majority of the episodes of the series so far. Starting with the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]], he also co-directed (with Weiss) episodes of the series.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Season_3_Directors/ Westeros.org]</ref>

Benioff and Weiss won the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series 2015 Emmy Award for the Season 5 finale, "[[Mother's Mercy]]".<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-of-thrones-breaks-the-record-for-most-emmy-wins-in-a-year/ ]</ref>

Speaking with ''Variety'' in April 2016, Benioff said that his favorite character is [[Sansa Stark]] - some fans (even from the books) hated her because they felt she started out as a brat, but Benioff enjoyed her character growth and inner strength as the story progresses.<ref>[http://variety.com/video/game-of-thrones-who-is-winning-killed-off/ ]</ref>
