'''Jaehaelor Mataeryon'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Jaehaelor Mataerion''}} was a [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] [[dragonlord]] and gardener.

==Biography==
Jaehaelor kept a glass orb greenhouse on the topless towers of the [[Mataeryon family|Mataeryons]], where he had a variety of plants, including nettles, [[silk grass]], [[Ruby Fern]]s, [[purple mango]]es, [[jeweled moss]], and curiosities such as a self-moving [[grunting shrub]] and the so-called [[White Tree of Flames]], which he spoke of with reverence.

Jaehaelor once caught the bedslave [[Narha]] nibbling on silk grass, which was forbidden for consumption by [[Slavery|slaves]] in the [[Valyrian Freehold]], and was obligated to cut her wrists with his [[Valyrian steel]] blade for the crime.

Jaehaelor was at work in the [[Forest of Qohor]] collecting samples for his gardens when the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]] struck the [[Valyrian peninsula]]. When he heard of the disaster, he flew on [[dragon]]back to [[Volantis]], where he began writing down everything he could remember of his gardens.

Jaehaelor's she-dragon died in captivity less than three years after the Doom. It is said that her wings shriveled after refusing to eat sheep, goat, dog, and horse. Jaehaelor also died shortly after on the [[Long Bridge]] of Volantis, where he had intervened after witnessing two masters lashing their [[Slavery|slaves]], only to be lashed himself before collapsing and dying at the age of five-and-fifty.

Jaehaelor's accounts of his gardens are collected in [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Mikkellion]]'s ''[[Shrubbery, Being a History on the Flora of the Valyrian Freehold|Shrubbery]]''.<ref>[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref>
