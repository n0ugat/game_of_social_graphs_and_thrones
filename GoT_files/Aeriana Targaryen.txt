'''Aeriana Targaryen''' was a member of [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]] before the [[Aegon's Conquest|Conquest]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Aeriana married into a [[Westeros]]i noble house. She is a great-great-grandmother of Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]]. The exact line is unspecified, except that she is the grandmother of Steffon's grandmother.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
During the [[Red Sowing]], Steffon is called upon to attempt to claim [[Seasmoke]], on account of his ancestry. He gladly goes through with it, but fails and dies in the attempt.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==Behind the scenes==
It is stated that Aeriana was born a "Targaryen princess," but this is highly implausible given what is known of the timeline and the Targaryen family tree. The fact that she is a great-great-grandmother of Steffon Darklyn, who was already old enough to serve in the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] during the late reign of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]]{{Ref|HOTD110}} (late 1st century / early 2nd century AC), suggests that she lived before the Conquest (likely in the same generation as Aegon the Conqueror's father, who is similarly named "Aerion" in the books), and therefore before a woman of House Targaryen would be called a princess. The use of the word "princess" is therefore treated here as loose speech or an error.

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Aeriana Targaryen. It is not known if the [[House Darklyn|Darklyns]] shared blood with the Targaryens.
