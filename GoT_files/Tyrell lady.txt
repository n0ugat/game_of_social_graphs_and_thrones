{{Quote|Do you like it, Nana?|Tyrell lady to [[Olenna Tyrell]]|And Now His Watch Is Ended}}
A '''Tyrell lady''' is a granddaughter of [[Olenna Tyrell]], one of Queen [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]'s cousins from a lesser branch of [[House Tyrell]], and her handmaiden.

==Biography==
===Background===
She is a granddaughter of [[Olenna Tyrell]], one of [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]]'s cousins from a lesser branch of [[House Tyrell]].{{Ref|GOT304}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
She is seated in the gardens of [[King's Landing]] with her grandmother, Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] and another girl embroidering a golden Tyrell rose with their [[House words|motto]], "Growing Strong," which prompts Olenna to criticize her embroidery before complaining about House Tyrell's "dull" words, comparing them to that of [[House Stark]] and [[House Greyjoy]], before observing that there is "[[Varys|a spider in the garden]]." When Varys approaches, Olenna shoos them away with the mocking advice to "grow strong."{{Ref|GOT304}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Margaery Tyrell arrives in [[King's Landing]] to [[Marriage|wed]] King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] accompanied by three handmaidens, Elinor Tyrell, Megga Tyrell, and Alla Tyrell. The girls are all daughters of different [[Cadet branch|cadet branches]] of [[House Tyrell]]. Elinor Tyrell is the only one of the three to have reached puberty. Both of the ladies seen in "[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]", as well as the two attending Lady Margaery in "[[Valar Dohaeris]]" are obviously adults, so that particular detail appears to have been ignored. Their relationship to Margaery might be the same, however, since these two refer to Olenna as "nana", this presumably means she is their grandmother - or at least, a relative close enough to think she can use the term. In the books, Olenna only has one other granddaughter beside Margaery: Desmera Redwyne, the daughter of Mina Tyrell and Paxter Redwyne (Olenna's daughter and first cousin respectively).
