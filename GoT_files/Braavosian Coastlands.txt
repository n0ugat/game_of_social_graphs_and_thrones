The '''Braavosian Coastlands'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} form the north-western coast of [[Essos]] along the shores of the [[Narrow Sea]]. They run south from the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Braavos]] towards its southern neighbor, [[Pentos]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Braavos is the most powerful city-state on the Narrow Sea, but is constrained by the geographic limitations of the city (located on a series of small islands in a lagoon). To overcome this, it is presumed that Braavos has established colonies and other settlements on the coastline to the south.
