A '''tourney herald''' announces the participants in King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s [[nameday]] celebration.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The herald announces the participants in King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s nameday [[Tournament|tourney]]. He claps when [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] knocks his opponent over the walls of the [[Red Keep]]. When Joffrey asks who is next to fight, he announces [[Lothor Brune]] and Ser [[Dontos Hollard]]. However, the latter fails to appear at his first call, and the herald has to summon him again.{{Ref|GOT201}}
