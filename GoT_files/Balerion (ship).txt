'''''Balerion'''''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the name given by [[Daenerys Targaryen]] to the ship she purchases to leave [[Qarth]] along with her ''[[khalasar]]'' and [[dragon]]s. It is named after [[Balerion]], the dragon of her ancestor [[Aegon I Targaryen]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Daenerys Targaryen and her followers arrive at the city of [[Astapor]] in [[Slaver's Bay]] on the ''Balerion''. As they approach, a few hours away from the harbor, her [[dragon]]s fly in circles around the ship and catch fish from the sea.<ref>"[[Valar Dohaeris]]"</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
The ship was actually a re-use of a prop ship designed and built by [[Gemma Jackson]]'s production team for [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]], which appeared on fire during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] (possibly the same prop ship used for ''[[Black Betha]]''). The ship was constructed in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, and it wouldn't have made sense to move it for scenes entirely set on the ship, so all of Daenerys's scenes on the ship were filmed in Northern Ireland. This makes it the only scene [[Emilia Clarke]] filmed in Northern Ireland instead of Morocco for Season 3. Filming for the scene took two days.<ref>[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/2013/4/17/behind-the-scenes-of-the-first-three-episodes.html Making Game of Thrones blog], April 17, 2013</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Illyrio Mopatis]] sends three ships - ''Saduleon'', ''Joso's Prank'', and ''Summer Sun'' - to Qarth to bring Daenerys back to [[Pentos]]. Daenerys renames the three ships after the three dragons of her ancestor Aegon the Conqueror - ''Balerion'', ''[[Meraxes]]'' and ''[[Vhagar]]'' respectively.

All three ships are taken apart at Daenerys's command to build siege machines when she [[Siege of Meereen|attacks Meereen]], much to the discontent of captain Groleo.
