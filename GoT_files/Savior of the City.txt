{{Quote|I, Joffrey of the House Baratheon, the First of My Name, the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, do hereby proclaim my grandfather, Tywin Lannister, the Savior of the City and the Hand of the King.|Joffrey Baratheon|Valar Morghulis}}
'''Savior of the City'''{{Ref|GOT210}} is an honorific title granted by King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] to his grandfather, [[Tywin Lannister]], [[Lord of Casterly Rock]] and [[Warden of the West]], as recognition for his role in the victory against the forces of [[Stannis Baratheon]] in the [[Battle of the Blackwater|Battle of the Blackwater.]]

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tywin's honorific is one of the many rewards granted to the participants of the Battle of the Blackwater. In Tywin's case it was also a move by [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and Joffrey to rob [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] of any credit for the city's defense by casting Tywin as the architect for the victory over [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. The title is also ironic considering the last time Tywin had led an army to King's Landing he ordered the city to be [[Sack of King's Landing|sacked]].
