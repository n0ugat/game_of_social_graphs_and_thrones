This ''' White Walker''' is one of the lieutenants of the [[Night King]] and leads the Army of the Dead towards [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Riding on an undead horse, the White Walker leads the army towards Eastwatch-by-the-Sea where he is the first to emerge from the forest. His arrival is witnessed by [[Tormund]] and [[Beric Dondarrion]]. The White Walker leads the undead army right towards the wall, where he halts his horse. Once he has stopped, the dead stop as well and together, they await the arrival of the Night King on top of the undead [[ice dragon]] [[Viserion]]. With Viserion's fire, the Night King breaks the Wall at Eastwatch.{{Ref|GOT707}}

Once the path is cleared, the White Walker starts moving again and the army follows him through the breach of the Wall into the North. Thus, the White Walker is the first member of the army of the dead to move south of the Wall.{{Ref|GOT707}}
