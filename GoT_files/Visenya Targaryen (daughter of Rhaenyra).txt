Princess '''Visenya Targaryen'''{{Guideref|Character Guide}}{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Visenia Targārien''}} was a [[prince]]ss of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]].

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] is pregnant with her sixth child when she returns to court at the [[Red Keep]] to discuss the [[House Velaryon|Velaryon]] succession; the child is to be her third with her second husband, Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Soon after Rhaenyra's return home to [[Dragonstone]], Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] arrives and informs Rhaenyra that her father, King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]], has died. Rhaenys further informs Rhaenyra that her half-brother, [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], has been crowned [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]], despite Rhaenyra being named her father's heir. The stress of the news causes Rhaenyra to go into premature labor.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

Rhaenyra labors in her apartments attended to by midwives, with the birth quickly becoming bloody, and it is noted that she is preterm enough that the child has not fully formed. The midwives reassure her that she can withstand the birth, as she has already had five children, but Rhaenyra is overwhelmed, especially as Prince Daemon begins to plan the forthcoming [[Dance of the Dragons|war]]. Rhaenyra rejects the midwives' attempts to help her with the birth, screaming and telling the child to "get out." Eventually, her labors complete, and she pulls out a mangled stillborn with scales as well as skin and the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck. Rhaenyra cradles her daughter and weeps. Though the [[Silent Sisters]] come to prepare the body, Rhaenyra wraps her child in funeral cloths by herself.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

Visenya is cremated on Dragonstone just as Ser [[Erryk Cargyll]] arrives with the crown of King Viserys I, and Rhaenyra is crowned queen at her daughter's funeral.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Visenya was born after three days of labor when Rhaenyra heard the news of her father's death and her brother's usurpation, with Rhaenyra said to have gone into a black rage. 

According to Mushroom, Rhaenyra was said to have cursed her child as a monster during the difficult labor. He claims that her child was born with [[dragon]]-like defects, such as being twisted and malformed, having a hole in her chest where her heart should have been, and having a stubby, scaled tail. Mushroom claims that he personally brought Visenya to be burned.
