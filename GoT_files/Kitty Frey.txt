'''Kitty Frey''' is the ninth wife of Lord [[Walder Frey]].<ref>http://www.gameofthrones.com/game-of-thrones/season-6/episode-8/houses/7/house-frey</ref>

==Biography==
===Background===
After the death of his eighth wife [[Joyeuse Frey|Joyeuse Erenford]] at the [[Red Wedding]], [[Walder Frey]] takes the young Kitty to wife. At the Red Wedding, Walder coldly refused to spare [[Robb Stark]]'s life in exchange for Joyeuse, telling [[Catelyn Stark]], who ultimately killed Joyeuse in response to Robb's death at the hands of [[Roose Bolton]], he would find another.{{Ref|GOT309}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Kitty nervously stands by his side as Walder angrily berates his sons [[Lothar Frey]] and [[Walder Rivers|Black Walder]] for allowing Catelyn's uncle [[Brynden Tully]] to retake [[Riverrun]]. As his sons report to their father of the various threats to their hold on the [[Riverlands]], Walder slaps Kitty on the rear and shouts that if he wants excuses, he would put her in charge. As he tells his sons what to do about the Blackfish, he pulls Kitty on to his lap and holds her close, making her visibly uncomfortable.{{Ref|GOT606}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
As Walder addresses his assembled kin in the Freys' hall, Kitty stands by his side. While preparing a toast, he brings out new wine, but stops Kitty when she tries to drink. Soon, all the Frey men begin to choke and bleed as Kitty and other women look in horror. Walder is then revealed to be [[Arya Stark]] as she pulls off a mask. Before leaving, Arya leaves a message with Kitty, saying to tell the others that "the North remembers" and that "winter came for House Frey".{{Ref|GOT701}}

==Family==

==In the books==
Walder Frey’s eighth wife, the teenaged [[Joyeuse Frey|Joyeuse Erenford]], died at the [[Red Wedding]] in the TV version, but not in the books. Therefore, Kitty, whom Lord Frey got to replace her, is an invention of the TV series.

In the books, Catelyn’s last desperate act was to hold Jinglebell (Lord Frey’s [[Halfwit|lackwit]] grandson) hostage with a knife to his throat, but Walder bluntly said she could go ahead and kill him because he wasn’t of much use (displaying that he hypocritically doesn’t really value his own family members). Rather than introduce too many new characters, the TV version just streamlined this so Catelyn grabbed his wife Lady Joyeuse instead, and ultimately killed her as Walder said she was replaceable.

Thus, TV-Joyeuse's replacement appears in Season 6.

Her name wasn't stated in dialogue but was given as "Kitty Frey" in the Season 6 HBO Viewer's Guide website. Her background, however, is unknown, such as what her maiden name was.
