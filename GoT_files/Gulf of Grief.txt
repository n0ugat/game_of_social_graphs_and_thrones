The '''Gulf of Grief'''{{Ref|H&L302}} is a body of water located south of [[Slaver's Bay]]. It is an inlet of the [[Summer Sea]] and separates the shattered lands of [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]] from the region of [[Ghiscar]]. Slaver's Bay itself is a large bay on the northern side of the Gulf of Grief.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s retinue is crossing the Gulf of Grief by ship when Daenerys decides to turn north to Slaver's Bay.<ref>"[[Valar Dohaeris]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Gulf of Grief is a busy sea, with ships from the [[Free Cities]] and the [[Jade Sea]] crossing it to reach the city-states of Slaver's Bay. It is not uncommon for ships to become becalmed while crossing it. Ship captains prefer to sail across the center of the gulf and along the eastern coast; as it is held to be bad luck to sail within sight of Valyria.

During the [[Doom of Valyria]], substantial tidal waves and tsunamis generated by the collapse of the landmass into the sea raced across the gulf, laying waste to many cities and kingdoms along its shores and on the islands. This may be the reason for the term "grief" in the title. Alternatively, it may be called "the Gulf of Grief" due to all of the massive wars in the past between Valyria on the west coast and the Ghiscari Empire on the east coast.
