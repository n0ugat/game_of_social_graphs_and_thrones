{{Quote|I am Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. I recognize no authority but the king's, and until there is one, I have no place here.|Harrold resigns from his post|The Green Council}}
Ser '''Harrold Westerling''' is a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Westerling]]. He was the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] of [[Viserys I Targaryen]]'s [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] following the death of Ser [[Ryam Redwyne]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Harrold is one of the longest-serving members of the Kingsguard. He was once a powerful knight with a successful military background. He was named to the Kingsguard during the reign of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]]. King Viserys has assigned him to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] as a sworn shield.<ref>[https://www.theilluminerdi.com/2020/12/08/house-of-the-dragon-characters/ The Illuminerdi, "House of the Dragon: More Fire and Blood Characters Confirmed for Game of Thrones Prequel"]</ref>

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
At the [[Dragonpit]] Harrold welcomes back Princess Rhaenyra, who has just returned from a ride on her [[dragon]] [[Syrax]]. When Rhaenyra asks him not to look so relieved, he responds that he is relieved every time her golden dragon brings her back unharmed as it saves his head from a spike. He escorts the carriage the princess and [[Alicent Hightower]] travel in back to the [[Red Keep]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Harrold tells Rhaenyra that her uncle Prince [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] has secretly returned to the Red Keep. Leading the princess into the [[throne room]], he is shocked to find Daemon sitting on the [[Iron Throne]], with Rhaenyra reassuring him that it is alright.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Harrold guards the princess in the royal box during the [[Heir's Tournament]]. He informs Rhaenyra about Ser [[Criston Cole]], stating that he only knows that he is the common-born son of Lord [[House Dondarrion|Dondarrion]]'s [[Criston Cole's father|steward]] and that he just unhorsed both [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] challengers in the tournament.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Harrold is present with his Kingsguard brothers at the funeral of Queen [[Aemma Arryn|Aemma]] and Prince [[Baelon Targaryen|Baelon]] as they are cremated by Syrax's flames.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Harrold protects King Viserys in the throne room when he confronts his brother Daemon about dubbing Baelon the "Heir for a Day." He draws his sword and moves to block Daemon's path when he tries to step toward the king seated on the Iron Throne.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Harrold is present with his Kingsguard brothers at the ceremony naming Rhaenyra as [[Prince of Dragonstone|Princess of Dragonstone]] and heir to the Iron Throne.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

After Ser [[Ryam Redwyne]]'s death, Harrold is appointed [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]].{{Ref|HOTD102}}

During the funeral of [[Laena Velaryon]], Harrold gently corrects Viserys when he mistakenly refers to Alicent as "Aemma." He later breaks up the fight between the royal children, declaring his horror at Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]]'s maiming. While Viserys attempts to learn the truth of what happened, Harrold remains silently on guard, only breaking to glare at Criston when he snickers at a comment by Queen Alicent regarding [[Laenor Velaryon]]. As Alicent moves to attack Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], Harrold attempts to keep order, ordering the Kingsguard back, and ordering Criston to be restrained when he attempts to assist the queen.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Six years after the events on Driftmark, Harrold arranges a welcome for Rhaenyra and Daemon.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

After the death of King Viserys, Harrold and Criston stand guard at the small council as they discuss what is to happen next. When Criston kills [[Lyman Beesbury]], Harrold draws his sword and demands he stand down and remove his cloak. Criston defiantly draws his sword in response and only backs down when Alicent commands him to. Harrold continues to stand guard in disbelief until Otto commands him to go to [[Dragonstone]] to assassinate Rhaenyra, causing Harrold to remove his cloak and resign from his post.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

==Personality==
Harrold is chivalrous and honorable.<ref>https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon/cast-and-characters</ref> He is loyal to King Viserys and Princess Rhaenyra.{{Guideref|Harrold Westerling}}

==Behind the scenes==
Harrold Westerling was revealed to be a recurring character in ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' on December 8, 2020. On September 24, 2021, [[HBO]] announced that [[Graham McTavish]] had been cast in the role for the series. His character description reads as follows:

:''"[Harrold] has served in the Kingsguard since the days of King Jaehaerys; he is a paragon of chivalry and honor."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

In the episode "[[The Green Council]]," Harrold's confrontation with Criston Cole originally included a moment in which he would have told Criston: "The rats in the Red Keep have more honor than you." According to McTavish, he was disappointed that the line hadn't made the final cut but understood the likely reasoning that someone as ill-tempered as Criston Cole would have likely reacted more violently to such an insult, thus affecting the plot significantly.<ref>[https://tvline.com/2022/11/11/house-of-the-dragon-ser-harrold-westerling-alive-dead-season-1-graham-mctavish-interview/ House of the Dragon's Upright Knight Graham McTavish Muses Ser Harrold's Post-Season 1 Finale Fate]</ref>

==In the books==
Harrold is only briefly mentioned in one sentence of ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', and he hasn't been mentioned in the main ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels.

It is unclear how Harrold is related to Johanna Westerling, who marries Lord [[Jason Lannister]] to become Lady of Casterly Rock and a fairly prominent recurring character.

In 112 AC, Harrold Westerling actually died of old age in the middle of Viserys's reign, two years before the wedding of Rhaenyra and Laenor. Thus the TV-version of Harrold seems to have been condensed together with aspects of one or two of the other Kingsguard members in this time period.

Coincidentally, in the books both Harrold Westerling and Grand Maester Runciter died within months of each other, after which [[Mellos]] was appointed to replace Runciter - and thus Harrold never met Mellos. Teaser trailers have revealed that the TV version merged Runciter and Mellos into one character named "Mellos", who is therefore Grand Maester at the beginning of Viserys's reign. The result is that "TV-Mellos" has been expanded to appear ''earlier'' than he did in the books, while "TV-Harrold" has been expanded to appear ''later'' than he did in the books, and they now overlap with each other.
