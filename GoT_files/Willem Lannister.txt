{{Quote|Is this a rescue?|Willem Lannister to [[Rickard Karstark]]|Kissed by Fire}}
'''Willem Lannister''', along with his brother [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]], was a [[squire]] in the Lannister army. Both were younger sons of [[Kevan Lannister]], and younger brothers of [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Willem and his brother Martyn are captured by the forces of [[House Tully]] led by [[Edmure Tully]] at the [[Battle of the Fords]]. The two are kept as [[hostage]]s at [[Riverrun]].{{Ref|GOT303}}

After [[Robb Stark|Robb]] visits Riverrun to attend [[Hoster Tully|his grandfather]]'s funeral, Willem and Martyn are visited in their cell by [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]], who tends to Martyn's wounded hand. Willem looks on in silence while Martyn asks if the tales told among the Lannisters about Robb turning into a wolf at night or devouring his enemies are true. Earlier, Robb criticizes Edmure for the Battle of the Stone Mill and concludes that Willem and Martyn are not valuable enough to exchange for [[Sansa Stark|his]] [[Arya Stark|sisters]].{{Ref|GOT303}}

Martyn and Willem are later murdered inside their cells by [[Rickard Karstark]] and five other men, in retribution for the death of his [[Torrhen Karstark|son]] by [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]].{{Ref|GOT305}}
