'''Wyl''' was a guardsman sworn to [[House Stark]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Wyl travels south with [[Eddard Stark]] when the latter is appointed [[Hand of the King]].{{Ref|GOT105}}

Wyl and another Stark guard named [[Heward]] accompany Eddard to one of [[Littlefinger's brothel]]s. Both are speared by Lannister guardsmen, at [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]'s orders, in retaliation for [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s arrest by [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]].{{Ref|GOT105}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Wyl is a young guardsman sworn to House Stark. 

Wyl is killed differently than in the show: the Lannister guardmen pull him off his horse and use their swords to kill him.
