A '''battle at the Yellow Fork''' is a minor engagement in the [[War of the Five Kings]]. The army of [[House Stark]] in the [[Westerlands]] moves west from [[Oxcross]] to attack a force of [[House Lannister]] conscripts at the [[Yellow Fork]].

==History==
===Prelude===
After winning a trio of victories in the [[Riverlands]] and a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Oxcross]], the army of House Stark, under the command of King [[Robb Stark]], Lord [[Roose Bolton]], and Lord [[Rickard Karstark]] press further into the Westerlands.<ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref> The victory at Oxcross has left the region lightly defended.<ref>"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref>

===Battle===
Robb's forces assault the Lannister forces at the Yellow Fork and win another victory, taking many more prisoners.<ref name="E17">"[[A Man Without Honor]]"</ref>

===Aftermath===
[[File:Camp.jpg|thumb|The Starks make camp following their victory.]]
Rickard Karstark reports taking so many Lannister prisoners that the Stark cells are overflowing. [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]] continues to treat Robb's wounded along with those of his enemies following the battle. Robb then visits the [[Crag]] to negotiate the surrender of [[House Westerling]].<ref name="E17"/>

Due to the volume of prisoners, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is kept with another man - his cousin [[Alton Lannister]] - for the first time since his capture. This affords him the opportunity to make an escape attempt, murdering Alton and [[Torrhen Karstark]]. He is recaptured shortly afterwards.<ref name="E17"/>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no battle of this name. The location "Yellow Fork" is not mentioned in the books.

After the [[Battle of Oxcross]] opened up the northern Westerlands to Robb's army, his forces easily captured Ashemark. For some reason, the TV series doesn't refer to a minor engagement at the "Battle of Ashemark", instead referring to a battle at the Yellow Fork taking place around the same point. It seems that they changed the name to avoid confusion with [[Ashford]], which is a castle in the Reach. It's possible that the "Yellow Fork" is meant to be the tributary of the Tumblestone, which is itself a tributary of the [[Trident]] River system, with its three main forks also named after colors: [[Red Fork|Red]], [[Blue Fork|Blue]], and [[Green Fork|Green]].
