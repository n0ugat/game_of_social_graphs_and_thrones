==Overview==
[[Image:Season 2 Locations map.png|thumb|600px|right|A map showing the notable locations featured in Season 2.]]
Season 2 spans several months on a world where the seasons last for years at a time. The [[Seven Kingdoms]] are at war, with the ''[[King in the North]]'', [[Robb Stark]], fighting to win independence for his people and those of the [[Riverlands]]. Robb decides that he must win the allegiance of the fiercely independent [[Ironborn]] to his cause, and sends his best friend [[Theon Greyjoy]] to treat with [[Balon Greyjoy|his father]], who is hatching plans of his own. Meanwhile, [[Joffrey Baratheon]] holds the [[Iron Throne]] with the backing of the powerful [[House Lannister]], but his uncle [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] has also claimed the throne with the support of [[House Tyrell]], whose armies are much larger. As they struggle for the throne, [[Tyrion Lannister]] arrives in [[King's Landing]] to take matters in hand, only to face opposition from his scheming sister, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], now the Queen Regent.

However, there is another faction entering the picture. [[Stannis Baratheon]], Robert's younger brother and Renly's older brother, has also claimed the Iron Throne. A proven battle commander and veteran of [[Robert's Rebellion|several]] [[Greyjoy Rebellion|wars]], Stannis is known to be utterly without mercy to his enemies and will do what is right even if it destroys him. Advising him is [[Melisandre]], an enigmatic [[Red priest|priestess]] from the east, who believes Stannis is meant for a [[Azor Ahai|greater destiny]], and Ser [[Davos Seaworth]], an honest and honorable man uneasy with the shifts in power at Stannis' court.

Far to the east, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has hatched the only three [[dragon]]s in the world. Eventually they will grow into terrifying monsters capable of destroying cities at her command, but for now they are still hatchlings and vulnerable. With her ''[[khalasar]]'' gone, Daenerys and her small band of followers must find a way across a [[Red Waste|forbidding wasteland]] and find new allies to support her claim to the Iron Throne.

In the distant north, the [[Night's Watch]] has mounted an expedition beyond the [[Wall]], searching for missing rangers and investigating rumors of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] gathering in the mountains. For [[Jon Snow]] this will be a rite of passage as he is asked to make difficult choices, for the realm and for himself.
