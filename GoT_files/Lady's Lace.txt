'''Lady's Lace'''{{Ref|GOT401}} is a type of vegetation that exists in the region of [[Slaver's Bay]] on the continent of [[Essos]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Daario Naharis]] gives [[Daenerys Targaryen]] a Dusk rose in a handful of flowers he has picked for her, ostensibly to show her the lay of the land around [[Meereen]], but truly a thinly veiled attempt to woo her.{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daario does present Daenerys with some local flowers as they approach Meereen, but this occurs "off screen" between Daenerys's POV chapters: she recalls it as happening recently in her next chapter. One of these is Lady's Lace.

"Lady's Lace" is one of several names for a real life plant, ''[[Wikipedia:Ammi majus|Ammi majus]]''. By process of elimination, it is the cluster of pale flowers in Daario's bouquet (which are visually close enough to ''A. Majus'').
