{{Quote|Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.|The handmaiden to [[Margaery Tyrell]]|Valar Dohaeris}}
'''Margaery Tyrell's handmaiden''' was in service to [[Margaery Tyrell]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Margaery's handmaiden rides with her mistress in a palanquin as the [[Joffrey Baratheon|King]]'s party returns to the [[Red Keep]] from services at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Somewhere in [[Flea Bottom]], Margaery stops the procession and disembarks. The handmaiden cautiously follows. Margaery begins to cross a muddy path into an orphanage; her handmaiden warns she will ruin her dress, so Margaery brushes off. As Margaery speaks with children in an orphanage, the handmaiden hands out toys, suggesting she was aware of at least some part of Margaery's plan.{{Ref|GOT301}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Margaery arrives in King's Landing to wed Joffrey, accompanied by three handmaidens, Elinor Tyrell, Megga Tyrell, and Alla Tyrell, daughters of different cadet branches of [[House Tyrell]]. Elinor is the only one of the three to have reached puberty. Other companions of Margaery include Meredyth Crane and Alyce Graceford.

Both of the handmaidens seen in "[[Valar Dohaeris]]," as well as the two attending [[Olenna Tyrell]] in "[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]" are obviously adults, so the prepubescent detail appears to have been ignored. Their relationship to Margaery might be the same, however, since the "And Now His Watch Is Ended" pair refer to Olenna as "nana," which presumably means she is their grandmother.
