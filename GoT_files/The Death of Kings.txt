==Narration==
'''Varys''': ''The [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] tell us that [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] came to [[Westeros]] with fire and blood, and hammered six kingdoms into one. The fire he undoubtedly brought, as the [[King]]s of the [[King of the Rock|Rock]], [[King of the Reach|Reach]], and [[King of the Iron Islands|Iron Islands]] learned.''

''But blood has never been in short supply here, ever since the [[First Men]] carried a crown into Westeros. This [[First King]] united his people against the [[Children of the Forest]] and is supposedly buried in the [[North]], a victim of a [[War of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|war]] he started. The first ruler of this land and the first to die on his throne. But not nearly the last.''

''For thousands of years afterwards, a thousand kings rose and fell, dying in their beds, in their battles, in their guards' and mistresses' arms.''

''The [[Age of Heroes]] sounds pretty until you realize what makes a hero: killing the enemies of his king. And to a king, there is no greater enemy than other kings. The [[House Stark|Starks]] and [[House Bolton|Boltons]], the [[House Gardener|Gardeners]] and [[Storm King]]s, the [[Ironborn]], and everyone else.''

''Even the mighty [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] were not immune from shortened reigns. Aegon's own son, [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]], was killed by the very [[Iron Throne]] his father had forged if you believe the tales. If you don't, then perhaps "the Cruel" is not a wise name for a king to earn.''

''[[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron]], First of His Name, tried to finish his ancestors' work and [[Conquest of Dorne|bring]] [[Dorne]] into the fold. For his efforts, he lost sixty thousand men and his own life of eighteen years.''

''During the great Targaryen civil war known as "the [[Dance of the Dragons]]," a [[Aegon II Targaryen|king]] and [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|queen]] each vied for the throne, dividing their house and its [[dragon]]s against each other. Eventually, the queen was fed to [[Sunfyre|her rival's dragon]] while [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|her son]] watched, and the victorious king soon died of his own wounds.''

''By the war's end, [[King's Landing]] was smashed, cities razed and sacked never to be rebuilt, and dragons had faded from this world.''

''Decades later, [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]] [[Legitimization|legitimized]] all of [[Great Bastards|his bastards]] on his deathbed. Inevitably, the greatest of these, [[Daemon Blackfyre]], declared himself the rightful heir and ignited [[Blackfyre Rebellion|yet another war for the crown]].''

''After much bloodshed, Daemon was killed by an alliance of [[Daeron II Targaryen|his]] [[Brynden Rivers|half-brothers]] on the [[Battle of Redgrass Field|Redgrass Field]]. All the same, his [[House Blackfyre|descendants]] continued to threaten the Targaryens until half a century later, when [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan the Bold]] slew [[Maelys Blackfyre|Maelys the Monstrous]] on the [[Stepstones]], extinguishing Daemon's line.''

''Given such an illustrious history, need we be so shocked by [[regicide]]?''

''A [[War of the Five Kings|war of five kings]] can end only one way. With the death of four. Yet even in times of peace, a wise ruler knows that when men [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] to a king, too often, they rise holding daggers.''
