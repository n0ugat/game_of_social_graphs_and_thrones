[[Otto Hightower|Otto]] mentions his nephew in a meeting of the [[Green Council]], stating that Lord Ormund is mustering his forces to march out from Oldtown.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

==Family==
{{Hightower tree}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Ormund supported [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] during the Dance of the Dragons. He had three sons: Lyonel, Martyn, and Garmund; and a daughter, Bethany. His first wife was mother to all four of his children, though her name is unknown. None of his sons were old enough to march to war with him during the Dance of the Dragons: the eldest, Lyonel, was only 15 when the war began. 

After Ormund's first wife died in childbirth, he remarried to Samantha Tarly, a beautiful maid young enough to be his daughter, as she was only two years older than his own son Lyonel. Their marriage became strained, as Lady Sam's father was from [[House Tarly]] and her mother was from [[House Rowan]], both of which were Reach houses that declared for Rhaenyra and against the Hightowers. Several sources allege that behind Ormund's back, Lady Sam began having an affair with her stepson Lyonel.
