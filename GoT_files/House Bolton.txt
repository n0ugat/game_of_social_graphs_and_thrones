{{Quote|In my family we say: A naked man has few secrets; a flayed man, none.|[[Roose Bolton]]|Garden of Bones (episode)}}
'''House Bolton'''{{Ref|GOT302}} of the [[Dreadfort]] is an extinct [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]]. After the [[Red Wedding]], they became the rulers of the [[North]], having [[Usurper|usurped]] their position from their former liege lords, [[House Stark]]. Their original lands were in the northeast of the North. The head of the house was the [[Lord of the Dreadfort]].<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/stark/roose-bolton/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Stark, Roose Bolton entry]</ref>

House Bolton was infamous for its centuries-old practice of [[flaying]] their enemies alive, to the point that they used a flayed man as their sigil. The Boltons supposedly gave up this practice after [[bending the knee]] to House Stark,<ref name="BoltonH&L">"[[House Bolton (short)|House Bolton]]"</ref> and centuries later, Lord [[Eddard Stark]] outlawed flaying in the North altogether, but the Boltons continued the practice.<ref name="E14">"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref> This led to them being despised and feared by many of the Northern houses, especially after their betrayal of House Stark.

House Bolton's [[heraldry]] consisted of a red flayed man upside-down, his flayed skin forming a white, X-shaped cross behind him, over a field of black. Their [[house words]] were "Our Blades Are Sharp,"<ref name="BoltonH&L" /> though a common saying of members of the house was "A naked man has few secrets; a flayed man, none."

==History==
===Background===
[[File:FlayedManHoldsNoSecrets.jpg|thumb|House Bolton is infamous for its centuries-old practice of [[flaying]] their enemies alive, to the point that they use a flayed man as their House sigil.]]
The origins of House Bolton date back to at least the [[Age of Heroes]], a savage age in which the houses of [[First Men]] waged war one upon the other. For centuries, the [[Red King]]s of House Bolton resisted the efforts of the [[House Stark|Stark]] [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] to unify the North under their rule, killing several Starks in the process, and, according to rumors, keeping their skins as trophies and even wearing them as cloaks. 
[[File:Royce Redarm.png|thumb|King [[Royce IV Bolton]], known as "the Redarm" because of his fondness for pulling out entrails.]]
During these centuries when the North was divided into a dozen or so smaller petty kingdoms, the Boltons and Starks were chief rivals for domination over all the others. House Bolton's kingdom covered a large portion of the lands east of Winterfell, centered around the Dreadfort itself.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season3/#!/locations/the-dreadfort/ HBO viewers guide, the Dreadfort entry]</ref><ref name="BoltonH&L" />
[[File:Bolton-bends-the-knee.jpg|thumb|King [[Rogar Bolton]] bends the knee to the Starks of [[Winterfell]].]]
Eventually, the Boltons were defeated and bent the knee to House Stark, giving up their practice of flaying their prisoners as sign of their submission. Nevertheless, they remained the second most powerful house of the North.<ref name="BoltonH&L" /> However, the practice of flaying was not officially outlawed until the lordship of Eddard Stark.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Though the Boltons, in Roose's words, have become a Great House and are now situated at Winterfell, the death of Tywin has left House Bolton's protection in a dire situation, since they no longer have enough men to hold the North should the bannermen of House Stark rise up against them, especially in response to Ramsay's atrocities. The Boltons also face a new threat in the form of [[Stannis Baratheon]], who is garrisoned at the Wall and is planning to retake the North from the Boltons and rally the North to his army for another chance to take the [[Iron Throne]]. In order to strengthen their position, Roose conspires with [[Petyr Baelish]] to have Ramsay marry Sansa, unaware that Baelish is apparently plotting the Boltons' downfall in revenge for the part they played in Catelyn's death.<ref>"[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"</ref>

Ramsay's death and the annihilation of his army mark the end of the Boltons' reign over the North and the extinction of House Bolton as a whole.<ref name="E59">"[[Battle of the Bastards]]"</ref>

==Military strength==
[[File:Battle of the Bastards 22.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of House Bolton at the Battle of the Bastards.]]
House Bolton commanded a formidable military prior to the outbreak of the War of the Five Kings, capable of fielding over 5,000 men.<ref name="E54" /> As the second most powerful house within the North, the Boltons forces are formidable, rivaled only by [[House Stark]] and [[House Manderly]] in terms of power and influence. Unlike most Northern houses, House Bolton is considered by far to be the cruelest, most gruesome, and most hated vassals within the North, thus earning them the aptly-befitting title of the “Bane of the North”. Being formidable rivals of their Stark overlords for centuries, before ultimately swearing fealty to the Kings of Winter. 

Bolton soldiers seem to be well-equipped. This is particularly evidenced by the degree of standardization of weapons and armor purchased due to high taxation of the probably intimidated and extorted populace.

The Bolton soldiers are outfitted with dark-colored leather tunics with chainmail and gorgets carved with the Bolton sigil. The most distinct characteristic of the Bolton army is the conical point-shaped helmets with a distinct groove at the edges which distinguishes them from other northern soldiers. The simplicity of the armor is more on its aesthetic and symbolic measure rather than practicality or effectiveness. Being likely attributed to the Bolton’s faculty of extreme cruelty, therefore, creating a sense of intimidation in the battlefield.  

House Bolton used a great deal of fear within their tactics, both militarily and politically. Their flaying reputation was very effective against the morality of their enemies and vassals after becoming the Norths dominant house. They tolerated no dissent of any kind and even the smallest of offenses were met with extreme punishments of torture. While this was effective for a time, the Boltons arguably used it too much and it contributed to their downfall. Even before becoming Wardens of the North, House Bolton was not very popular among the other Northern houses, but the excessive violence and bullying of their now subjects led to all out hatred. By the time of the Battle of the Bastards, the Boltons only had two houses come to their aid, and although both of these houses still gave them a massive numerical advantage over their enemies, neither ally was aiding out of respect. House Karstark was supportive due to disdain towards the Starks, and House Umber due to their desire to wipe out the Free Folk they believed were invading their lands. After the battle and House Boltons extinction, both immediately returned their allegiance to House Stark suggesting that was only Harald Karstark and Smalljon Umber themselves who felt this way.  

The Bolton army appears to be well-trained and well-organized in battle, fighting several battles during the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Such battles include the [[battle in the ice]], where Bolton cavalry performed a perfect pincer movement around [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s army and completely surrounded it. In the [[Battle of the Bastards]], Bolton soldiers surrounded the Stark army in a shield phalanx, and began cutting down the Stark forces with spears from behind the shields. The Bolton army was also responsible for [[Fight by Deepwood Motte|ending]] the [[Ironborn]] occupation of the North, by recapturing the castles and lands claimed by the invaders. Ultimately, it took the intervention of [[House Arryn]], another Great House, to bring about the Boltons' downfall.

==In the books==
[[File:House Bolton ASOIAF.svg|thumb|200px|right|The Bolton coat of arms in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels: A flayed man on pink with red drops.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Bolton is noted as one of the most powerful families of the North. They are noted for flaying their enemies alive and even wearing their skins as cloaks. They have even captured and flayed Starks in the distant past. House Bolton were unruly vassals of the Starks until approximately a thousand years ago, when they finally bent the knee. Three hundred years later they rebelled but were defeated. The armies of House Stark besieged the Dreadfort for two years before finally forcing the Boltons to surrender and submit.

The Boltons are considered a sinister and ill-omened house, but Lord Roose Bolton is noted as a capable battle commander. Roose Bolton fought alongside [[Eddard Stark]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. After the [[Battle of the Trident]], Roose suggested executing the defeated [[Barristan Selmy]], but Eddard and [[Robert Baratheon]] refused.

***Lady "Arya Stark", actually [[Jeyne Poole]], Ramsay's second wife. Currently in custody of King Stannis Baratheon.

Domeric Bolton died shortly before the beginning of the series, having sought out his bastard half-brother Ramsay (Domeric having always wanted a brother of his own). With no other trueborn heirs, Roose brought Ramsay to the Dreadfort and began to treat him as his heir.

The sigil of House Bolton in the books is a red flayed man on a field of pink with red blood drops. The TV series design has specified that the flayed man is displayed hanging upside down, his flayed skin forming an X-shaped cross. The color scheme in the TV series is slightly different: it is a red flayed man, but hanging upside-down, his flayed skin forming a white, X-shaped cross with a black background.
