Ser '''Lyonel Bentley''' is a [[Knighthood|knight]] who lived during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Lyonel Bentley was one of the replacements named to Rhaenyra's [[Kingsguard|Queensguard]]. It is unknown where he was from, because House Bentley is never mentioned outside of Lyonel's name: he may have just been a landed knight.

Rhaenyra began the war with three out of her father's seven Kingsguard, but then [[Erryk Cargyll]] died fighting his twin brother and [[Steffon Darklyn]] died trying to claim a dragon. This left only Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]], as up to that point Rhaenyra hadn't had the opportunity to name any other replacements to round out her Queensguard to a full seven members. After Steffon's death, however, the need for replacements became painfully clear, so Rhaenyra charged Ser Lorent with the large task of naming six replacements all at the same time.  Lorent was able to find six knights who all served Rhaenyra capably, among them [[Adrian Redfort]] and Lyonel Bentley.
