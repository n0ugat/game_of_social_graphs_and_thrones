==Narration==
'''Bran Stark''': ''When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] invaded [[Westeros]], he had [[Seven Kingdoms]] to contend with.''

''The [[North|Kingdom of the North]], the [[Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]], the [[Iron Islands]], the [[Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]], the [[Reach|Kingdom of the Reach]], the [[Stormlands]], and [[Dorne]].''

''These regions had been established by the [[First Men]] thousands of years before, in the [[Age of Heroes]].''

''One hero of this fabled age was [[Brandon the Builder|Bran the Builder]]. Bran raised the [[Wall]] and built the stronghold of [[Winterfell]], establishing House Stark and reigning as the first [[King in the North]].''

''Other legends tell of the [[Grey King]] in the [[Iron Islands]]. Grey King took a [[mermaid]] to wife and defeated [[Nagga]], the first [[sea dragon]]. [[House Greyjoy]] of [[Pyke]], the current rulers of the region, claim to descend from him.''

''[[House Casterly]] ruled the gold-rich [[Westerlands]] from their mighty seat of [[Casterly Rock]]. But their lands and power were swindled from them by the legendary trickster, [[Lann the Clever]]. The noble House of [[House Lannister|Lannister]] is said to have descended from him.''

''The verdant and fertile lands of the [[Reach]] were first ruled by [[House Gardener]]. Its founder, known as [[Garth the Gardener|Garth Greenhand]], wore a crown of flowers and vines. He ruled from [[Highgarden]] as the first [[King of the Reach]] and was said to have made the land bloom. Many noble houses trace their bloodlines back to him, including the current [[Lord of Highgarden|lords of Highgarden]], [[House Tyrell]].''

''In the [[Stormlands]], according to ballads of the age, a warrior named [[Durran Godsgrief|Durran]] fell in love with [[Elenei]], whose father was [[god of the sea]], and mother was [[goddess of the wind]]. She gave her maidenhead to him, committing herself to a mortal life.''

''Enraged, her parents called upon the winds and waters, destroying Durran's bayside keep and wiping out his wedding gift. Durran declared war on the gods and rebuilt his keep, which was also destroyed.''

''Four more castles he raised, each stronger than the last. All fell to the power of the gods. But Durran's seventh castle, [[Storm's End]], withstood the gods' rage. Durran became known as Durran Godsgrief and reigned as the first [[Storm King]].''

''There are countless other tales from the Age of Heroes, too many to count. These histories weren't recorded in a book but passed down from generation to generation through story and song.''

''And while some of them may be dismissed as fairy tales, every one of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] is defined by them.''
