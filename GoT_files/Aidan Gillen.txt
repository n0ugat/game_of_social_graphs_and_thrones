{{Quote|Littlefinger's always a step or two ahead of most people and revels in the uncertainty he provokes; it's a perfect stage for schemes within schemes. You're never really certain whose side he's on, which of course is how he likes it… Varys and Littlefinger's sparring is fun and razor-sharp. Either of these two would ice the other without a second thought, if need be, which would be a shame because they're a good match for each other. The world would be a duller place.|Aidan Gillen on playing Littlefinger<ref>''[[Inside HBO's Game of Thrones]]''</ref>}}
