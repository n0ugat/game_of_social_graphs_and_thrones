When Cersei tries to go to her daugther's funeral, he and a small group of soldiers bars her from doing so, stating that the King ordered them to do so. When [[Gregor Clegane|Ser Gregor Clegane]] intimidates him with his size, the Lannister captain and his men prepared themselves to fight him, should he attack.
