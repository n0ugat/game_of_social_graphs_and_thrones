{{Quote|Aye.|Une agrees to [[Bran Stark]]'s ascension|The Iron Throne}}
Lord '''Une''' is a [[Lordship|lord]] of the [[Stormlands]] who takes part in a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]] to determine [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s fate as well as the new [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]]. 

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
He sits next to [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]. Like the rest of the assembled council, he accepts the ascension of King [[Bran Stark|Bran I the Broken]] as King of the Andals and the First Men.{{Ref|GOT806}}

==Behind the scenes==
The character's name is not mentioned in the show or in the credits. However, actor Michael Benbaruk's [https://cre8talent.co.uk/portfolio/michael-benbaruk/ CV] lists his character as "Lord Une." It is unclear if "Une" is supposed to be the character's given name or house name as the titles "Lord" and "Lady" frequently have been used to precede both given and House names. No character by the name Une appears in the books, and there is also no record of a House Une. The principal surviving Houses of the Stormlands whose lords are as of yet unseen are [[House Caron]], [[House Morrigen]], [[House Connington]], [[House Swann]], [[House Wylde]], [[House Estermont]], and [[House Errol]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character by this name.
