In the February 2013 issue of ''Gay Times'' magazine, Jones commented on playing a homosexual character: "In terms of the gay community, I’ve got a very strong reaction that people are happy with it, happy that gay characters are being portrayed but not in a sensationalized or stereotyped way, and they’re being put into a world that is a very masculine, hard world. I hope that they think that we’re not stereotyping them."<ref>[http://www.justjared.com/2013/01/01/game-of-thrones-finn-jones-shirtless-speedo-for-gay-times/ JustJared.com], January 2013</ref>
