{{Quote|So he had no one to warn him when his third wife, sensing an advantage, declared that his second wife had been unfaithful, and produced a list of potential fathers of the misshapen child.|[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel (short)}}
Queen '''Tyanna of the Tower'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the third [[Marriage|wife]] of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Maegor Targaryen]].

==Biography==
[[Grand Maester]] [[Myros]] spoke against the marriage of Maegor and Tyanna, arguing that Maegor's marriage to his [[Alys Harroway|second wife]] had ruined [[Aenys Targaryen|King Aenys]]'s reign. For this, Maegor [[Execution|beheaded]] Myros and officially declared war on the [[Faith of the Seven|Faith]].{{Ref|H&L806}}

When Queen Alys miscarried, Tyanna declared that she had been unfaithful, and wrote a list of potential fathers of the stillborn child. The king executed Alys and her father, Lord [[Lucas Harroway]], the [[Hand of the King]]. He then marched on [[Harrenhal]] and slaughtered the entire [[House Harroway|Harroway]] family.{{Ref|H&L806}}

Tyanna was also unable to give Maegor an heir. Desperate, Maegor took three more wives, known as the [[Black Brides]].{{Ref|H&L806}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Tyanna was rumored to be the natural daughter of a Pentoshi [[magister]]. She was a tavern dancer and later a [[Prostitution|courtesan]]. She was the first [[Master of Whisperers]] (using the feminine title "mistress of whisperers"). She was Maegor's third wife, and the fourth to die of his six wives.

In 48 AC, she was seized and taken to the dungeons to be tortured. As the [[Kingsguard]]s Owen Bush and Maladon Moore prepared their tools, she confessed responsibility for the abonimations that [[Alys Harroway]] and [[Jeyne Westerling]] produced, and vowed that the same would happen to [[Elinor Costayne]]. Maegor cut out her heart with [[Blackfyre]] and fed her to his [[dog]]s. Tyanna's promise about Elinor came true: two months later, she gave birth to a stillborn monstrosity as well.
