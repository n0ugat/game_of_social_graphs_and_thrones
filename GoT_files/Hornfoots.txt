{{Quote|The Hornfoots have it easy in the mountains. The cold so hardens and blackens the soles of their feet that they don't even need boots.|[[Tormund]]|The Nations of the North}} 
The '''Hornfoots'''{{Ref|GOT302}} are a clan of [[Free Folk]]. They live in the foothills of the [[Frostfangs]], far away from the coasts. The hard rocky terrain in the mountains hardens and blackens their feet until it is as tough as leather, and they do not need boots.{{Ref|H&L410}}

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The Hornfoots now march in the army of [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], [[Mance Rayder]], who has united all of the different wildling clans to assault the [[Wall]] and force their passage to the south. Mance points out that the [[Thenns]] hate the Hornfoot, and that the Hornfoot hate the [[ice-river clans]].{{Ref|GOT302}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Following [[Jon Snow]]'s betrayal and flight from the wildlings, he reports back to Castle Black's remaining leadership that Mance Rayder is advancing on their position with an army 100,000 strong, and that he has united the [[Thenns]], Hornfoots, and the [[ice-river clans]], and he even has [[Giants]] marching with him.{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Hornfoots are known for wearing nothing on their feet, even in the sub-arctic snows of the lands beyond the Wall, which turns their soles as hard as boiled leather. They are enemies of the Nightrunners.
