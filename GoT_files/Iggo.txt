==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Iggo and his companion [[Aggo (The Red Woman)|Aggo]] encounter [[Jorah Mormont]] and [[Daario Naharis]] in the streets of [[Vaes Dothrak]]. Aggo tells him to get the others. Iggo runs away and Darrio goes after him, while Jorah fights Aggo. Iggo is killed by Daario who snaps his neck.{{Ref|GOT604}}

Later, the [[green khal|green ''khal'']] accuses another ''khal'' of trampling Iggo.{{Ref|GOT604}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is a Dothraki named Iggo, but he is not a member of any ''khalasar''. He is one of the Brave Companions, a notorious sellsword company.

Following the escape of [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], and [[Hot Pie]] from [[Harrenhal]], Iggo is part of a four-man squad of Brave Companions searching for them. Iggo's group is set upon by a pack of wolves, led by [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]. The others die and Iggo kills two of the wolves, but is slain by Nymeria, who may be protecting Arya. Arya herself experiences the scene through a wolf dream.
