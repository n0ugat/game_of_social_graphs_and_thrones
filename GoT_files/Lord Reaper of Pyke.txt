==In the books==
''The World of Ice & Fire'' sourcebook confirms that "Lord Reaper of Pyke" is just a self-styled title that the Greyjoys gave themselves, long ''before'' they ever ruled as exclusive kings of all the Iron Islands (long before the Andal Invasion). It doesn't signify sovereign status - i.e. even if a member of House Drumm was elected king by the [[kingsmoot]], the head of House Greyjoy at the time would still be called "Lord Reaper" of Pyke. There was some confusion about this for a while - but it doesn't make sense that the Drumms would call themselves "Lord Reaper of Pyke" when they ruled from Old Wyk, etc. The ''World'' book confirms that Aegon I Targaryen appointed the Greyjoys as the new "Lord Paramount" of the isles, they didn't have an alternate title.
