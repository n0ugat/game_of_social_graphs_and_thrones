==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the bulk of the naval forces of the Seven Kingdoms are composed of the [[royal fleet]], the [[Redwyne fleet]], and the [[Iron Fleet]]. The royal fleet is anchored at [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], positioned to defend King's Landing and [[Blackwater Bay]] . The large fleet of [[House Redwyne]] is used primarily to defend their home ports on the [[Arbor]], a large island off the southwest coast of the [[Reach]]. The Iron Fleet, composing the navy of the [[Iron Islands]], isn't usually thought of as at the authority of the Iron Throne. If anything, the royal fleets are often used to keep the Iron Fleet in check when [[ironborn]] captains ignore the ban on commerce raiding that the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] kings imposed when they took power. [[House Lannister]] also commanded a [[Lannister fleet|large fleet]] anchored at [[Lannisport]], but it was destroyed in the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]]. The Lannisters subsequently rebuilt their local fleet, though it is kept on a purely defensive posture around Lannisport during the War of the Five Kings, due to the nearby threat of the ironborn.

During the [[Dance of the Dragons|Dance of Dragons]], the [[Greens]] offered the position of Master of Ships to Lord [[Dalton Greyjoy]] as a bribe for his allegiance, though on the proviso Dalton use his fleet to break the [[Velaryon fleet]]'s blockade of the [[Gullet]]. Dalton rejected the offer, as he had no interest in either the title nor risking his fleet sailing around Westeros to battle a naval commander as skilled as Corlys; instead he took the Blacks' counteroffer asking that he merely attack [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s enemies, which would allow Dalton to enrich himself plundering the lands loyal to his and Rhaenyra's mutual enemies in [[House Lannister|Houses Lannister]] and [[House Hightower|Hightower]].

One of Stannis's few advantages at the opening of the [[War of the Five Kings]] is that while he - initially - has the smallest land army out of all factions in the war, as the former Master of Ships, a disproportionately large fraction of the royal fleet sides with him. [[George R.R. Martin]] confirmed in the Blu-ray commentary for "[[Blackwater]]" that while it is not outright stated in dialogue in the TV series, Stannis's position as Master of Ships during his brother Robert's reign is why he has the allegiance of most of the royal fleet.

At the beginning of the series, Stannis is the Master of Ships. In the third novel the office is given to Mace Tyrell.

In the fourth novel, Cersei renames the office "grand admiral". She removes Mace Tyrell and his bannermen from the council, and names Aurane Waters, a bastard member of [[House Velaryon]], to the seat (not so much in view of his skills, but because he reminds her of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]), over the objections of [[Pycelle]] and Jaime. Cersei dismisses their protests, but both are ultimately proven correct: following Cersei's downfall, Aurane flees the capital with the new dromonds she had commissioned, setting himself up as a pirate lord preying on the shipping lanes around the [[Stepstones]].

After Kevan takes over, he appoints Lord [[Paxter Redwyne]] as the lord admiral and Master of Ships - a suitable appointment, in view of Lord Paxter's experience as a commander of naval forces. Paxter is promptly despatched to deal with the ironborn terrorizing the coast of the Reach ever since [[Euron Greyjoy]]'s [[Kingsmoot on Old Wyk|coronation]] as [[King of the Iron Islands]] (Cersei having allowed his raids to go unchecked largely to spite the Tyrells has resulted in the Ironborn now being in a position to threaten both [[Oldtown]] and the Arbor).
