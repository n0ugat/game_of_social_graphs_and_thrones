The '''Whispers'''{{Ref|GOT701}} is the name given to a ruined castle in the [[Crownlands]], the region controlled directly by the [[Iron Throne]] in [[King's Landing]]. The castle is located north-east of King's Landing at the very tip of [[Crackclaw Point]]. The Whispers are named for the eerie sound the sea makes as it crashes into the holes in the cliffs below the castle.{{Cite}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Whispers was the former stronghold of House Crabb. Ser Clarence Crabb is said to have beheaded every enemy he slew in combat and brought them back home, where his wife kissed them, restoring them to life. Crabb kept the living heads - including an alleged King of [[Duskendale]] - in the castle, seeking their counsel. The Whispers is named in legend for the sound of the heads' whispering their advice to the knight.

In reality, the castle is most likely named for the sound of the water pouring through holes in the cliff below the castle. Coastal erosion has seen the castle's beacon tower collapse into the sea within the last two generations.

The lords of Crackclaw Point - including those of the Whispers - were a quarrelsome lot, refusing to accept the authority of any of the [[Andals|Andal]] kings. During [[Aegon's Conquest]], [[Visenya Targaryen]] flew to the area on her [[dragon]] [[Vhagar]] and won the allegiance of the people, promising they would hold fealty to the [[Iron Throne]] alone.

In ''A Feast for Crows'', [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] and [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] arrive at the Whispers while searching for Sansa. They encounter three former members of the Brave Companions - Timeon, Pyg and Shagwell - who kill their guide Dick Crabb. Brienne kills all three thugs.
