The '''Smith'''{{Ref|GOT210}} ​is an aspect of the [[Seven]]. He represents creation and craftsmanship.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Smith represents crafts and labor. He is usually prayed to when work needs to be done, for strength. He carries a hammer.

During [[Baelor I Targaryen]]’s reign he had a stonemason named as the [[High Septon]], a man that could carve stonework so beautifully that Baelor believed him to be the Smith in human form. While a fantastic stonecarver, the new High Septon could not read or write, nor could he recite any prayers.

While in a nameless village, [[Catelyn Stark]] prays in a sept is modest and has no statues of the Seven, only rough charcoal drawings to represent them. She kneels before the Smith, who fixes things that are broken, and asks that he give her sweet [[Bran Stark|Bran]] his protection.
