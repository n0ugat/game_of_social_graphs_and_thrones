==Behind the scenes==
[[Florence + The Machine]] recorded the version of the song that plays over the end credits of "[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]". [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] are fans of the band and had approached them to record a version of "[[The Rains of Castamere]]" for the end credits of "[[Blackwater]]", but their request was turned down and [[The National]] recorded the song instead. Florence Welch was not told the context in which the song would be used, but agreed to record it as she was a fan of the show and liked the sad and haunting nature of the song.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/21/arts/television/game-of-thrones-florence-and-the-machine.html ‘Game of Thrones’: Florence and the Machine’s Frontwoman on That Haunting Closing Song]</ref>
