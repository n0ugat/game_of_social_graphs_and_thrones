A '''regent'''{{Ref|GOT107}} is a person who rules in the name of a [[king]], queen, [[Lordship|lord]], or lady because the rightful ruler is a child, incapacitated, absent, or otherwise incapable of ruling with any degree of force. When ruling in the name of a child, the regent's rule ends when the heir reaches adulthood. In the [[Seven Kingdoms]], the legal age of adulthood is 16 years old.

When a regent rules in the name of the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]], he or she may also hold the title of [[Protector of the Realm]]. A royal regent also holds a seat in the [[Small Council]], taking the place of the monarch. While a regent functionally rules in place of the monarch, only the actual ruler and the [[Hand of the King]] may sit on the [[Iron Throne]] itself. For this reason, [[Cersei Lannister]] sits on a gilded chair at the foot of the throne when she serves as regent for her son [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].

If a king dies and the queen mother acts as regent for their child, she is known as the "queen regent". Since a regency, by definition, requires a king's death, the title "king regent" is never used; a male acting as regent for a king would hold the title "lord regent". A prince ruling in a king's stead may be titled "prince regent", as with the case of [[Aemond Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD205}} Regents for regular lordships may be called "lord (lady) protector" or "lord (lady) regent". [[Petyr Baelish]], for example, was named [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Vale of Arryn]] for [[Robin Arryn]] following the death of his mother [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]].
