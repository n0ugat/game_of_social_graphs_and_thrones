'''Willem''' was a commoner who was killed by [[Yoren]] for killing his older brother. 

==Biography==
===Background===
Willem was handsome, very tall, had white teeth, blue eyes, and a dimpled chin.{{Ref|GOT203}}

Willem, for unstated reasons, stabbed Yoren's older brother to death, and fled before anyone could react. From then on, Yoren became obsessed with him, thinking about him whenever he did anything, going as far as whispering his name every night before sleep.{{Ref|GOT203}}

Willem returned to his hometown years later, and Yoren killed him by burying an axe so deep into his skull, they had to bury him with it. Afterwards, Yoren rode Willem's horse to the [[Wall]] and joined the [[Night's Watch]].{{Ref|GOT203}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Yoren recounts to [[Arya Stark|Arya]] his past history with Willem.{{Ref|GOT203}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are several characters whose first name is Willem ([[Willem Darry]], [[Willem Frey]], [[Willem Lannister]]), but none of them have anything to do with Yoren or his family. Yoren never speaks of his relatives.
