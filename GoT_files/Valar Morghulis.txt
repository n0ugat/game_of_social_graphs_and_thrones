==Synopsis==
===In King's Landing===
[[File:Shae and Tyrion Scar 2x10.png|thumb|180x180px|Shae uncovers Tyrion's scar.]]
In new, shabby quarters, [[Tyrion Lannister]] convalesces from the wound he suffered during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] at the hands of [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Mandon Moore]]. He is informed by a gloating [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]] that he is no longer Acting [[Hand of the King]], as his father [[Tywin Lannister]] has returned to the city and will take over his duties as Hand. [[Varys]] visits and tells him that [[Bronn]] has been relieved of his command of the gold cloaks and his hill tribesmen have gone home with their plunder; Tyrion has lost all of his power. Varys thanks Tyrion for his part in defending the city, noting that no one else will do so. [[Shae]] urges Tyrion to leave with her for [[Pentos]], but he refuses. 

King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] rewards those who served him well in the battle. Lord Tywin Lannister is officially named Hand of the King and Savior of the City. [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] is awarded [[Harrenhal]] for brokering the alliance between Houses Lannister and Tyrell. [[Loras Tyrell]] asks that Joffrey wed his sister [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] to unite their houses. Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] and Pycelle make a show of convincing Joffrey to set aside his [[Marriage|betrothal]] to [[Sansa Stark]], given the treachery of [[House Stark]]. Joffrey plays along and agrees to wed Margaery. In private, Sansa is overjoyed to be free, until Littlefinger points out that it will not stop Joffrey from tormenting her; however, he does assure her that he will help her escape, for the sake of her mother.

[[Ros]] is visited by Varys, though she doesn't realize who he is until she discovers his [[eunuch]] status. Varys gets Ros to admit she's afraid of Littlefinger, and tells her that unlike her current employer, he protects those who work for him.

===On Dragonstone===
Following his defeat at the Blackwater, [[Stannis Baratheon]] has retreated back to [[Dragonstone]]. He rages at [[Melisandre]] for not foreseeing his defeat, despite her claims to see the future. Melisandre insists that the [[Lord of Light]] only allows her glimpses and that Stannis cannot abandon the war because of a single defeat. Stannis accuses her of lying to him, of knowing nothing about war and angrily begins to strangle her. When Melisandre insists her god is in him, Stannis releases her, realizing she is talking about the [[Shadow|creature]] they created to murder [[Renly Baratheon|his brother]]. Melisandre tells Stannis he will betray his men, his family and his beliefs but in the end, it will be worth it; she assures Stannis that he is the [[Prince That Was Promised]] and he will be king. Stannis is skeptical, but Melisandre has him look into a brazier; Stannis appears to have visions, restoring his faith in the [[red priest]]ess.

===In the Westerlands===
[[File:210 Robb Talisa wedding 3.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Robb and Talisa are wed.]]
In the [[Westerlands]], King [[Robb Stark]] speaks with his mother [[Catelyn Stark|Lady Catelyn]] regarding his love affair with the woman [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]]. Catelyn urges Robb to remember his vow to wed a daughter of [[House Frey]], or face severe consequences. She says that she and [[Eddard Stark|Robb's father]] didn't love each other when they first married, but that he grew to love her over time. She predicts that Robb and his betrothed might build a similar love over time. Robb disregards her advice and marries Talisa in private that night. [[File:Brienne Jaime Stark Men 2x10.png|thumb|Jaime recognized by Stark men.]] Traveling east to [[King's Landing]], [[Brienne of Tarth]] and [[Jaime Lannister]] come upon the bodies of three women, hanged by Stark soldiers for having slept with Lannister soldiers. When the men return, the pair try to lie their way out of the situation. Jaime is recognized and Brienne chose to kill the soldiers. In so doing she reveals her prowess as a fighter to Jaime. When Jaime reminds her that she killed Stark men, Brienne responds that she does not serve House Stark, but [[Catelyn Stark]].

===At Winterfell===
[[File:Theon & Dagmer 2x10.jpeg|thumb|Theon giving a speech to his men, right before Dagmer knocks him out.]]
In [[Winterfell]], [[Theon Greyjoy]] is besieged by a northern army under command of [[Ramsay Bolton|Roose Bolton's bastard son]]. [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] tells Theon his chances of holding the castle with only twenty men are negligible. Luwin suggests that Theon join the [[Night's Watch]], gaining a chance to redeem himself. When Theon refuses (fearing that Jon Snow will kill him for his betrayal) and tries to rally his men for battle, they betray him; [[Dagmer]] knocks Theon out. When Luwin tries to intervene, Dagmer stabs him with a spear. The ironmen place a bag on Theon and depart Winterfell to deliver him to the Bolton army.

Some time later, [[Bran Stark|Bran]], [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]], [[Osha]] and [[Hodor]] emerge from their hiding place in Winterfell's crypts and find the castle burning. They discover the dying Luwin in the [[godswood]]. He insists that the boys must go north to the [[Wall]], as there are too many enemies in the south and Jon will be able to keep them safe and tell their mother of their survival. Luwin affirms his pride at having served the Starks before asking Osha to give him a quick death.

===In the Riverlands===
Traveling away from [[Harrenhal]], [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] and [[Hot Pie]] cross paths with [[Jaqen H'ghar]], who has been waiting for them. He offers to take Arya with him to [[Braavos]], where she can learn his skills of killing and find a way to kill those on her list. She declines, wanting to be reunited with her family. Jaqen gives her an iron coin and the words "Valar Morghulis," telling her to speak them to any man from Braavos should she ever need to find him again. Jaqen bids Arya farewell, using her real name, and departs, [[Faceless Men|changing his face to that of a different man]] as he leaves.

===In Qarth===
[[File:Daernerys vision Iron Thrones 2x10.jpg|thumb|Daenerys in her vision of the Iron Throne room.]]
[[Daenerys Targaryen]] arrives at [[House of the Undying]] and is magically separated from [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] and [[Kovarro]]. She finds herself in an empty circular room with many doors. She chooses one and opens it. She is presented with tempting visions. First the snowy, ruined throne room of King's Landing where she turns away from the [[Iron Throne]]. She then walks through the gates of the Wall surrounded by more snow, and into [[Drogo]]'s tent. She finds Drogo and what would have been her infant son [[Rhaego]]. They talk about whose dream they are in, and Daenerys silently leaves after touching Rhaego's hair. She returns to the room with many doors and finds her [[dragon]]s chained to a pedestal in front of her. [[Pyat Pree]] appears and explains that she and her brood are the source of his restored magic. Daenerys is also chained by Pyat's magic. The young queen is unconcerned however, and simply regards Pree with a cool, almost lazy gaze. She calmly utters a single word: "[[High Valyrian|Dracarys]]"; after a couple of tries, all three dragons unleash their fiery breath, and Pyat Pree is incinerated.

Daenerys knows that [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos|Xaro]] has betrayed her. She returns to his palace to confront him and finds [[Doreah]] in bed with him. She takes his key and uses it to open his Valyrian stone vault. She is surprised when it is empty, but observes that this proves something can easily come from nothing. On her orders, Doreah and Xaro are locked into the empty vault to die, their pleas cut off by the closing door. Daenerys salvages enough from Xaro's household to buy a ship. On Jorah's orders, the Dothraki seize Xaro's gold and jewels while Daenerys triumphantly watches with her three dragons.

===Beyond the Wall===
[[File:Wilding's Camp 2x10.png|thumb|The King-Beyond-the-Wall's Camp.]]
[[Jon Snow]] and [[Qhorin]] are marched towards the camp of the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], [[Mance Rayder]], as captives of the [[Lord of Bones]]. Qhorin realizes that he will have to sacrifice himself in order to facilitate the ruse of Jon deserting to the wildlings, so he stuns one of his captors and acquires a sword, attacking Jon with the seeming intention of killing him for treachery. The Lord of Bones lets them fight, and [[Ygritte]] gives Jon back his sword. Qhorin enrages Jon by insulting his parentage. After a fierce duel, Jon mortally wounds Qhorin per Qhorin's own instructions, who whispers to Jon "We are the watchers on the Wall" before he breathes his last, signalling to him that he has done the right thing and reminding Jon that he must find out all he can about the wildlings' plans and get back to the Wall. By his killing Qhorin, the wildlings believe Jon has betrayed his oath and release him. Impressed, the Lord of Bones cuts Jon free. Ygritte shows him their vast army, gathering in a valley below. She promises to take him to their King and, with no other choice, Jon follows her.
[[File:Wights 1x10.png|thumb|180x180px|White Walkers lead the Army of the Dead.]]
At the [[Fist of the First Men]], [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]], [[Grenn]] and [[Eddison Tollett|Edd]] are foraging for fuel when they hear three horn blasts; the warning call for [[White Walkers]]. The three run back to the Fist. Sam is left behind, caught in a sudden blizzard. Seeing shadowy figures moving through the blowing snow, Sam hides behind a rock and watches as dozens of [[wight]]s walk past him, led by a [[White Walker (Valar Morghulis)|White Walker]] riding an undead horse-wight. Sam cowers in fear, but the White Walker seemingly ignores him. Raising a spear with a blade of ice, the creature gives a piercing shriek, and the army of wights and White Walkers, numbering several hundred, advances on the Fist.

==Behind the scenes==
*''Valar Morghulis'' is a common greeting in [[Braavos]], meaning "all men must die" in [[High Valyrian]]. It is meant in the sense of "all men must (eventually) die," sooner or later, somewhat like the Latin saying "''memento mori.''" The customary response is ''Valar Dohaeris'' — "all men must serve." The actual translation is not mentioned in the episode and was not provided until [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]]'s episode "[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]".
**This phrase is used as a game over screen for [[Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series|the Telltale version]] whenever the playable characters die non-canonically.
*Varys tells Tyrion that the tribesmen were paid by Tywin and went home. This is the last reference in the show to the [[hill tribes]].
**In the novels, although the tribesmen do not appear on-screen after the battle of the Blackwater, it is mentioned that they have become a dangerous menace to the Vale, since they have been armed with steel weapons and armors, in compliance with the deal they made with Tyrion.
*With a runtime of 64 minutes, this episode was the longest of the television series until it was dethroned by "[[The Children]]," two minutes longer at 66 minutes.
*The episode was 10 minutes longer than usual to allow for the resolution of the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and setting up new story lines for the third season.<ref>[http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/GraphicCity/news/?a=60605 Comic Book Movie News reporting on the extended finale]</ref>
*The episode won a [[wikipedia:Creative Arts Emmy Award|Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Visual Effects in September 2012.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Game_of_Thrones_Wins_Big_at_Creative_Arts_Emmys/ Westeros.org]</ref>
*Executive Producers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss decided to play a practical joke on Alfie Allen (who plays Theon Greyjoy), by giving him a fake script for the season finale, in which Bran Stark kills Theon Greyjoy, in a massive departure from the novels. Their hope was to get a rise out of Allen, on seeing that his character was not only unexpectedly killed off, but by none other than Bran. However, instead of being frustrated, Allen actually thought that such a major departure was an intriguing idea, to the point that he didn't realize it was a joke for quite some time, just a bold change the writers were making. Thus he had no particularly strong reaction to the fake script. Some time later they called him on the phone to say that they were thinking of bringing Theon back as a [[wight]] with no dialogue, which was so obviously a joke that Allen realized they'd just been trying to play a prank on him.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Comic_Con_Panel_Video/ Westeros.org]</ref>
*Theon refuses to take the black, believing that Jon would kill him. When someone joins the Watch, his criminal record is erased clean, no matter what vile deeds he performed; Jon should follow that rule and refrain from harming any new recruit, even if he is one of the Starks' enemies (a Lannister) or their henchmen. Theon, however, is far worse in a sense than the other ironborn who invaded the North, or anyone else who wronged the Starks in general, since he grew up with the Starks and seemed to be their ally. Therefore, Theon's fear is not baseless: had he joined the Watch, Jon might have not restrained himself from paying him back for the atrocities he committed against the North in general and against the Starks in particular.
*Theon repeats his father's incorrect statement from "[[The Night Lands]]" - that Ned Stark killed [[Rodrik Greyjoy|Rodrik]] and [[Maron Greyjoy]]. Actually, Rodrik Greyjoy was killed by Lord [[Jason Mallister]] at an [[assault on Seagard]], and Maron Greyjoy was killed by a collapsing tower during the [[Siege of Pyke]]; Theon knows that well. In fact, when Balon says that in the parallel book scene to "[[The Night Lands]]", Theon muses that it is not true.
*The sword fight scene between Jon and Qhorin was filmed on a cliff with a 500 foot drop. It was a two day shoot, and they were sinking into the snow which left them both exhausted.<ref>Access Hollywood Interview : Kit Harrington on Filming "Difficult" and "Emotional" Game of Thrones Season 2 Finale</ref>
*The final sequence of the camera panning away to reveal the White Walkers and their army of hundreds of wights was meant to be filmed in Iceland in November 2011. However, the producers weren't happy with the White Walker costumes from Season 1, and they wanted to redesign them for their full reveal in the Season 2 finale (as up until this point they've just been glimpsed in the shadows). This meant the final scene had to be reshot on a sound stage in London. The design changes took so long that by the time they had finished, director Alan Taylor had to leave to work on ''Thor: The Dark World'' and was unavailable to film the reshoots. As it was primarily a special effects sequence being produced by the TV series' special effects studio [[Pixomondo]], the sound stage reshoots were ultimately directed by Pixomondo’s visual effects supervisor Rainer Gombos.<ref>[http://www.fastcocreate.com/1681718/collaboration-isnt-always-pretty-behind-the-emmy-winning-vfx-for-game-of-thrones?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+fastcocreate/feed+%28Co.Create%29#1 Fastcocreate.com] "Collaboration Isn’t Always Pretty—Behind The Emmy-Winning VFX For “Game Of Thrones”</ref>
**No less than 1,000 [[wight]]s are depicted in the closing special effects shot. This was achieved by the series' special effects group Pixomondo using only fifty extras, digitally doubled up to make the entire army. Roughly 10-30 White Walkers are interspersed among them. However, only one full version of the redesigned White Walker costume had been created, so only one stunt man played all of the White Walkers, digitally doubled up (and sometimes wearing different equipment to try to distinguish them).
*At the end of the episode, when Daenerys's followers are ransacking Xaro Xhoan Daxos' palace, Jorah says in subtitled [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]], "take all the gold and jewels!" This was added with only a few hours before shooting had to wrap, but the crew was not able to contact language consultant [[David J. Peterson]] in time. Because [[Iain Glen]] (Jorah) has delivered a large amount of Dothraki dialogue before, the crew asked him to just ad-lib the line as best he could. The correct way to say this exact line in Dothraki is "''Fichas ei hoshor ma dan,''" but the line that Glen ad-libbed was something close to "''Mas ovray movekkhi moskay.''" Peterson retroactively came up with a translation so Jorah's line would make sense in Dothraki, with the literal translation, "The remaining valuables are for loading."<ref>[http://www.dothraki.com/2012/06/hash-yer-ast-fin/ David J. Peterson's blog], Dothraki.com, June 16, 2012.</ref>
*Fans frequently asked the writers why Robb Stark and Talisa were married by a septon of the [[Faith of the Seven]], when he apparently follows the [[Old Gods]] like his father did (and Talisa, being from the Free Cities, wouldn't follow the Faith of the Seven either). Writer [[Bryan Cogman]] explained that they just wanted to get quickly married in secret and a septon happened to be readily at hand, so it was just a spur of the moment decision. Cogman pointed out that Robb was raised in an interfaith household, since his mother Catelyn follows the Faith and Eddard even married her in the sept at [[Riverrun]]; so Robb was at least exposed to the Faith of the Seven growing up, and apparently just liked the pageantry of their marriage ceremony.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.</ref>
*The contrast between the way Robb and Joffrey act in this episode is quite ironic:
**Robb, the son of the man who was famous for keeping his word, behaves whimsically and irrationally, by breaching his pact with the Freys for a political nobody.
**The villainous Joffrey, known for his poor, whimsical, and irrational decisions (mainly the [[Execution of Eddard Stark]]), states that "a king must keep his word" and initially refuses to breach his betrothal to Sansa (though it is just a show). It is politically wise of him to wed Margaery, a member of a powerful Westeros house. Breaching his betrothal with Sansa (which meant to provide the Lannisters with a claim to the North) has not caused his house any political damage, since his family intends to marry her to Tyrion.
**In the novels, Catelyn sorrowfully thinks ''"If you had to fall into a woman's arms, my son, why couldn't they have been Margaery Tyrell's? The wealth and power of Highgarden could have made all the difference in the fighting yet to come."''{{Bookref|ASOS|14}} Thus, while breaching the pact with the Freys was bad for Robb's reputation, had he done that to form a marriage-alliance with more powerful house than the Freys (House Tyrell definitely falls in that category) - it would have strengthened the Starks.
