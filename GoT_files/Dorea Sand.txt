==Biography==

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Dorea's story is the same. She is eight years old.

After [[Doran Martell]] hears the plans that the three elder Sand Snakes have in mind to avenge their father, he orders to arrest them lest they ignite a war with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], and their younger sisters too (except [[Sarella Sand|Sarella]]), fearing that the young Sand Snakes may be used by others in plots against him. Dorea is sent to the [[Water Gardens]] alongside her mother and her three sisters, where she uses a morningstar to knock oranges from trees. Following the arrival of Ser [[Balon Swann]], Doran releases Dorea, her mother and sisters.

In "Arianne I" sample chapter from the sixth novel, it is mentioned Dorea remains at the Water Gardens while her mother travels with her sister [[Loreza Sand|Loreza]] to [[Hellholt]].
