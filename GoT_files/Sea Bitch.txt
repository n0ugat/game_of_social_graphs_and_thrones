The '''''Sea Bitch'''''{{Ref|GOT203}} is a longship of the [[Iron Fleet]]. 

==History==
===Background===
The ''Sea Bitch'' is assigned to [[Theon Greyjoy]] for raiding along the [[Stony Shore]].<ref>"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]"</ref> 

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The crew of about 20 men are led by Theon in the [[Capture of Winterfell|surprise seizure of Winterfell]].<ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref>

==Crew==
*{[[Theon Greyjoy]]} - captain, impaled by the [[Night King]].
*{[[Dagmer|Dagmer "Cleftjaw"]]} - first mate, [[Flaying|flayed]] by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]].
*{[[Drennan]]} - crewman, killed by [[Osha]] at [[Winterfell]].
*{[[Gelmarr]]} - crewman, flayed by Ramsay Snow.
*{[[Black Lorren]]} - crewman, flayed by Ramsay Snow.
*{[[Stygg]]} - crewman, flayed by Ramsay Snow.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the ''Sea Bitch'' is a ship built in [[Lordsport]] by Sigrin the Shipwright. It does not belong to the Iron Fleet. The ship isn't given to Theon as a slight against him and is not the only ship he commands. The crew assembled by Theon is composed by:
*Rymolf Stormdrunk, a steersman in the crew of Victarion Greyjoy
*Urzen
*Maron Botley, called Old Botley and Fishwhiskers
**His sons
*Stygg
*Gevin Harlaw
*Cadwyl

In the books, Asha (Yara) actually just disparagingly calls Theon's new ship "a sea bitch", and Theon impudently declares that she just picked a great name, so Theon himself chooses to name it "Sea Bitch". In the TV version Yara mockingly assigns Theon a ship already named "Sea Bitch", making the joke at his expense instead of hers as in the book.
