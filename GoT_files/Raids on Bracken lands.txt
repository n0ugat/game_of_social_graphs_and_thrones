The villages of [[Lambswold]] and [[Mory]] were '''raided''' by the forces of [[Willem Blackwood]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==History==
===Prelude===
[[File:2x5 Brackens.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Daemon threatens Lord Bracken.]]
In the early Dance of the Dragons, Houses [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken|Bracken]] enter open war, beginning with the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]].{{Ref|HOTD203}} Later, [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] joins with Willem Blackwood to defeat the Brackens and make them raise [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s banner, but Lord [[Amos Bracken]] remains defiant even in the face of Daemon's [[dragon]] [[Caraxes]]. Still intent on turning the Brackens to his cause, Daemon lets Amos live and orders Willem to harry House Bracken's [[smallfolk]] and force a surrender.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

===Raids===
[[Lambswold]] and [[Mory]] are brutally raided by the Blackwoods. [[Sept]]s are looted and put to the torch, fields and farms are burned, livestock are stolen, peasants are put to the sword, and women and children are taken from their homes.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

===Aftermath===
With the Brackens overwhelmed, [[Stone Hedge]] falls and Amos Bracken declares for the [[Blacks]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

The raids are strongly condemned by several riverlords, including Lords [[Petyr Piper|Piper]], [[Lord Darry|Darry]], and [[Walys Mooton|Mooton]], and [[Lady Mallister]], who denounce Daemon as a tyrant. [[Alys Rivers]] also disapproves of the raids, pointing out that many innocent people were harmed; Daemon tries to justify the raids, but Alys is not convinced.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Willem is sentenced to death for his actions by Lord [[Oscar Tully]] and beheaded by Daemon.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the raids on Bracken lands were carried out by Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]], who is dead by this point in the TV series. It is not specified which villages were raided.

In contrast to the show, the raids took place before the [[Battle at the Burning Mill|Battle of the Burning Mill]], not afterwards, and none of the riverlords complained about them.
