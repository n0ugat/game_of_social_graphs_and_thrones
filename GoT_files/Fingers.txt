The '''Fingers'''{{Ref|GOT104}} are a region on the east coast of the [[Vale of Arryn]], located along the shores of the [[Narrow Sea]]. It consists of five long, slender peninsulas extending into the sea, divided by bays, inlets and channels. [[House Baelish]] rules over the smallest of the Fingers.

[[Petyr Baelish]], who holds a [[Baelish keep|keep]] in the smallest of the Fingers, is popularly called "Littlefinger" for his small size during his childhood and the location of his family's lands.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Fingers are lonely, cold and windswept. The [[Andals]] landed on the Fingers during their invasion of [[Westeros]] and weathered stones bearing the symbol of the [[Faith of the Seven]] can be found dotted along the shore in some areas.

House Baelish owns a small, unassuming tower on the smallest of the Fingers without name or [[Order of Maesters|maester]]. Littlefinger refers to it disdainfully as the "Drearfort" (not to be confused with the [[Dreadfort]])

Following [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]'s escape from King's Landing, Littlefinger takes her first to the Fingers. Sansa is stunned to see what a miserable, forsaken place it is.

In the ''[[Histories & Lore]]'' short "[[House Baelish (short)|House Baelish]]", Baelish says that the Fingers consist of four peninsulas, but ''The World of Ice & Fire'' sourcebook (2014) confirms that there are actually ''five'' fingers (the title "Lord of the Five Fingers" was used by the rulers of an Andal proto-kingdom). "Littlefinger" Baelish is from the smallest of these, the northernmost, nearest to the [[Three Sisters]] islands. The mistake is easy to make: the peninsula is so "little" that it isn't clear just by looking at a map if it is actually considered a "peninsula" or just a variation of the shape of the coastline. It also was never stated before the ''World'' book exactly how many peninsulas make up "the Fingers".
