{{Quote|This is seizure! It is theft! It is treason!|Lyman on the green coup|The Green Council}}
Lord '''Lyman Beesbury''' was the Lord of [[Honeyholt]] and [[Master of Coin]] on the [[Small Council]] of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]].<ref>[https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon ''House of the Dragon'' | Official Website for the HBO Series | HBO.com]</ref> He was the first victim of the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
In [[112 AC]],{{Dateref|The Heirs of the Dragon}} Lyman, as [[Master of Coin]] attends a meeting of the [[Small Council]] in the [[Red Keep]]. Lyman brings up that the crown has invested in the training and equipping of the [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|City Watch]] which Prince [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] requested, and he urges [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] to get the prince to fill his seat on the table to inform the council on his role as commander. The king then asks him if Daemon is distracted by these tasks, with Lyman responding he hopes so with the amount of gold involved. When the [[Heir's Tournament]] is brought up Lyman puts forward that the tourney should be delayed for the cost of it and to wait until the king's child is born. Lord [[Lyonel Strong]] responds that most of the nobility of [[Westeros]] is already on their way to [[King's Landing]]. King Viserys then states that the tourney will last more than half a week and before it is over his child will be born, so there is no need for a delay.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Lyman attends a [[Small Council]] meeting that discusses King Viserys's younger brother Daemon's actions with the gold cloaks and the criminals of the capital. He is annoyed by the prince's insults toward his own wife, Lady [[Rhea Royce]], and by the petty arguing between Daemon and the Hand of the King, Ser [[Otto Hightower]]. Lyman attends the [[Heir's Tournament]] seated in the royal box. He bets five [[Money|gold dragons]] in the joust on Daemon beating Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]], the eldest son of Ser Otto. Lyman is later notified by Otto of the news of the birth of Prince [[Baelon Targaryen|Baelon]] and the death of Queen [[Aemma Arryn|Aemma]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Lyman attends the funeral of Aemma and Baelon. He later attends a [[Small Council]] meeting that debates the succession. He remains silent throughout. Lyman is also present at the Small Council meeting, in which Daemon is reported to have held a celebratory party at a pleasure house on the [[Street of Silk]] and is claimed to have dubbed Baelon the "Heir for a Day." Lyman is in attendance at the ceremony naming [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] as [[Princess of Dragonstone]] and heir to the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

A Small Council meeting to discuss finding a replacement for [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] [[Ryam Redwyne]] is interrupted by Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]], who wants the Crown's help ridding the [[Stepstones]] of the [[Triarchy]] forces led by [[Craghas Drahar]]. Lyman points out that the [[Seven Kingdoms]] have never entered open war with the [[Free Cities]], and that doing so could result in incalculable losses. Lyman and the Small Council are informed by a [[Dragonkeeper Elder (The Heirs of the Dragon)|Dragonkeeper Elder]] that Prince Daemon has stolen a dragon egg. Lyman reacts with shock upon hearing Daemon's intention to place the egg in the cradle of his unborn son.{{Ref|HOTD102}}

Lyman attends the Small Council meeting where King Viserys announces, to the shock of everyone present, that he intends to marry Lady [[Alicent Hightower]].{{Ref|HOTD102}}

In [[116 AC]],{{Dateref|King of the Narrow Sea}} Lyman attends a Small Council session, he remains silent and listens to the council discussing the [[Stepstones]] and the spurned Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] entering into negotiations with the [[Sealord of Braavos]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

Lyman Beesbury attends the Wedding of [[Laenor Velaryon]] to Princess Rhaenyra, he is seated next to [[Grand Maester]] [[Mellos]]. He stands and claps for the future royal couple and later panics and flees once Ser [[Criston Cole]] beats Ser [[Joffrey Lonmouth]] to death.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

In [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|The Princess and the Queen}} Lyman is still [[Master of Coin]] years after Rhaenyra's marriage to [[Laenor Velaryon]] and the birth of her sons, though somewhat thinner of hair and partly senile. During a Small Council meeting discussing yet another flare-up between [[House Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken]], Lyman remains silent until the matter is already settled, speaking up in favor of [[House Blackwood]] only to be told that the council has moved on to another subject. Lyman softly agrees with Queen Alicent's statement that the fortification of the [[Stepstones]] would be too costly, he is quickly interrupted by Rhaenyra who counters Alicent's statement with the "cost of war is greater."{{Ref|HOTD106}}

In [[132 AC]],{{Dateref|The Lord of the Tides}}, Lyman is present at a meeting of the Small Council, headed by Queen Regent Alicent. When the council briefly discusses the succession of [[Driftmark]], Lyman insists on the claim of [[Lucerys Velaryon]] as heir to Driftmark, Lyman is disputed by Lord [[Jasper Wylde]]. Lyman Beesbury later partakes in another session of the [[Small Council]], recounting the state of the realm's finances, he is interrupted by Alicent who thanks him for his "exhaustive" accounting. Lyman is present to hear Ser Vaemond Velaryon petition for the inheritance of Driftmark, he is a witness to the execution of Ser Vaemond.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Lyman is summoned to the [[Green Council]] chambers before dawn along with the other members to be informed of the death of King Viserys, who had succumbed to his long illness and apparently declared with his last breath that he wished for Aegon to succeed him over Rhaenyra, which the rest of the Small Council take as support for their until-now secret plans to crown Aegon regardless. Lyman is shocked to witness the extent of this plot and speaks up against it, admonishing his fellow councilors for plotting to replace the king's chosen heir with what he deems an imposter. Lyman remains firm in his convictions, pointing out that hundreds of lords and landed knights swore fealty to Rhaenyra twenty years prior only for Lords [[Tyland Lannister]] and [[Jasper Wylde]] to dismiss this by pointing out that most of those have died over the intervening twenty years and that Viserys changed his mind. Undeterred, Lyman states that as a man seventy-six years of age, he knew Viserys longer and better than any of them and refuses to believe this claim that he recanted his stance on his deathbed alone with only Alicent to bear witness to it. He rallies further, accusing them of seizure, theft, and treason before [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] advises him to mind what he says.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Ignoring this, Lyman presses on by pointing out that Viserys was "well" the previous night by all accounts, all but accusing the [[Greens]] of having murdered him; as he begins to firmly state his opposition to their plots, Ser [[Criston Cole]] (who had stolen up behind him whilst he was ranting) forcibly grabs the elderly lord and shoves him down intending to make him return to his seat. This instead causes Lyman's head to slam hard against his marble of office, puncturing his temple and killing the [[Master of Coin]] instantly, much to the shock and horror of all present. His body is then left, silent and leaking blood all over the table, where it lies as the remaining members of the Council continue to finalize their plot.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[House Beesbury]] goes to war against their liege lords the [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightowers]], in retribution for Lyman's death.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==Personality==
Lyman is frugal in his management of the economy.{{Guideref|Lyman Beesbury}} Lyman is a loyal servant of King Viserys, fulfilling his duty as Master of Coin whilst eschewing plotting and politics, and continues this loyalty after Viserys dies, remaining true to the late king's wishes for the succession and refusing to believe the Greens' claims that Viserys changed his mind even when it is clear that he is outnumbered in this regard. His integrity and forthrightness unfortunately costs him his life, however.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

==Behind the scenes==
On September 24, 2021, [[HBO]] announced that [[Bill Paterson]] had been cast in the role of Lyman Beesbury for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. His character description reads as follows:

:''"Lord of Honeyholt and Master of Coin on King Viserys's small council."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Lord Lyman Beesbury was Lord of Honeyholt and the [[Master of Coin]] during the reign of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys the Conciliator]] and also under Viserys I, as a replacement of Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]].

After Viserys's death, Lord Beesbury was the only member of the Small Council to oppose the accession of Aegon over Rhaenyra. His fate is disputed in ''Fire & Blood'': Grand Maester [[Orwyle]], who was present in the council chamber, claims that Lyman Beesbury was arrested and taken to the black cells, where he died of a chill; Septon [[Eustace]] claims that Ser Criston Cole used a dagger to cut open his throat; Mushroom suggests that Criston threw Lyman out of a window, causing him to land on the iron spikes of [[Maegor's Holdfast]]. However, despite these claims, neither Mushroom nor Eustace were present in the council. As a result of his death, Lyman Beesbury became the first casualty of the Dance of the Dragons.

In the show, the manner of his death is closer to the aforementioned second version, but slightly different: first, instead of having his throat cut open, his skull was punctured; second, unlike in the novel, Criston killed him by accident instead of doing it on purpose; lastly, the latter was killed before he could finish his sentence on not wanting to take part in betraying Rhaenyra.
