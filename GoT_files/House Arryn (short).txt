==Narration==
'''Catelyn Stark''': ''In the snow-capped [[Mountains of the Moon]], standing high above the rich lands of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], stands the [[Eyrie]], a storied and impregnable fortress said to have built by the legendary [[Mountain King]]s in the [[Age of Heroes]].''

''It is the stronghold of [[House Arryn]], one of the oldest noble families in [[Westeros]]. Their sigil, a soaring white falcon over a crescent moon; their words, "As High As Honor."''

''The Arryns are direct descendants of [[Andals|Andal]] [[Coming of the Andals|invaders]], who sailed across the [[Narrow Sea]] and came ashore at the [[Fingers]].''

''According to legend, Ser [[Artys Arryn]], known as "the Winged Knight," soared through the skies atop a giant falcon, landing on the peak of the highest mountain, where he defeated the [[Griffin King]] in battle.''

''It was the Andals' first great victory over the [[First Men]]. And Ser Artys was duly rewarded. He was declared [[King of the Mountain and the Vale]], and the region renamed "the Vale of Arryn."''

''Thousands of years later, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] arrived in [[Westeros]]. House Arryn bent the knee to Aegon and his dragons and were allowed to maintain their control of the region as [[Defender of the Vale|Lords Paramount of the Vale]] and [[Warden of the East|Wardens of the East]].''

''Over the centuries, the House Arryn remained loyal to the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]]. Until Lord [[Jon Arryn]] joined with Houses [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] and [[House Stark|Stark]] in [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] against [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King Aerys]].''

''Upon winning the [[Iron Throne]], [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] named Lord Jon [[Hand of the King]], a position he held until his mysterious death.''
