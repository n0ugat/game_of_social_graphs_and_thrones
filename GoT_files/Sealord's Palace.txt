{{Quote|Freed of the constraints of secrecy, Braavos quickly grew into the wealthiest and most powerful of the Free Cities, and, one could argue, the most beautiful. From the sprawling Sealord's Palace with its menagerie of strange beasts and birds to the imposing Palace of Justice and the aqueduct we call the Sweetwater River that bears fresh water from the mainland, Braavos is without rival, in either engineering or elegance.|Tycho Nestoris|Braavos (short)}}
The '''Sealord's Palace'''{{Ref|H&L504}} is the home of the [[Sealord of Braavos]]. It is a sprawling building that houses a menagerie of exotics beasts and birds.<ref>"[[Braavos (short)|Braavos]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Sealord's Palace is located on a small peninsula in the northeast of the city, at the eastern end of the Purple Harbor. It is north of the [[Moon Pool]], the headquarters of the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] and the end of the [[Sweetwater River]]. The palace is made up of domes and towers, and a golden thunderbolt turns at the top of it.

[[Dareon]] deserts from the [[Night's Watch]] when he visits [[Braavos]] with [[Samwell Tarly]] and [[Gilly]]. He states his intention to one day perform at the Sealord's Palace, but he is killed by [[Arya Stark]] shortly afterwards.
