'''Rory McCann''' (born 24 April 1969) is a Scottish actor. He rose to prominence in commercials, followed by a Scottish [[wikipedia:BAFTA Awards|BAFTA]]-award winning turn as disabled personal trainer Kenny McLeod in ''[[wikipedia:The Book Group|The Book Group]]''. He has since moved into films, putting in notable appearances as General [[wikipedia:Craterus|Craterus]] in [[wikipedia:Oliver Stone|Oliver Stone]]'s film ''[[wikipedia:Alexander (film)|Alexander]]'' and as Michael 'Lurch' Armstrong (alongside [[David Bradley]] and [[Jim Broadbent]]) in ''[[wikipedia:Hot Fuzz|Hot Fuzz]]''. He has also put in appearances in British television dramas ''[[wikipedia:State of Play (TV serial)|State of Play]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Shameless|Shameless]]''. After filming in [[wikipedia:Iceland|Iceland]] for the movie ''[[wikipedia:Beowulf & Grendel|Beowulf &amp; Grendel]]'', McCann relocated there permanently, but was left without work following the economic crisis before he was cast in ''Thrones''.

He stars in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Sandor Clegane]]. He was confirmed in the role on 23 September 2009. He was part of the initial starring cast and remained a member of the starring cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second]], [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third]], and [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth]] seasons, before taking a break during the [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|fifth]] season due to his character allegedly dying, and then reappeared in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|sixth]] season to reprise the role of the Hound.

Benioff and Weiss missed Rory McCann's audition tape (as they were reviewing hundreds of audition tapes for dozens of characters). [[George R.R. Martin]] himself, however, enjoyed McCann's previous work so much that he e-mailed Benioff and Weiss urging them to watch the audition tape, upon which they cast McCann.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/game-of-thrones/243771/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4 ]</ref>

Rory's sister Sally-Gay McCann works in costumes for film and television, and she also works on ''Game of Thrones'' in the [[Costumes]] department.<ref>[
