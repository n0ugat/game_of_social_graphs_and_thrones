'''Aegon's Conquest''',{{Ref|TDOD}} also known as the '''War of Conquest'''{{Ref|H&L115}}{{Ref|HOTD104}} or simply the '''Conquest''',{{Ref|H&L615}} was the first of the [[Wars of Conquest]] initiated by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] to conquer the continent of [[Westeros]]. Supported by his sister-wives, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]], and their dragons, [[Meraxes]] and [[Vhagar]], as well as his own, [[Balerion]], Aegon successfully unified six of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]] under the invading forces of [[House Targaryen]] within two years. Only [[Dorne]] was able to successfully resist Aegon's conquest. Despite its name, the conflict was not entirely resolved on the field of battle, as some regions and houses of Westeros actively supported the Targaryen war effort, while others voluntarily surrendered to their might. 

Upon the conclusion of his conquest, Aegon was crowned by the [[High Septon (Aegon's Conquest)|High Septon]] as the first [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]], establishing the ruling Targaryen dynasty of the Seven Kingdoms for the next three centuries. Aegon's coronation date subsequently became the basis for the Westerosi calendar, with [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] tracking years from before and after Aegon's ascension to the throne.

==History==
The Targaryen family had moved from [[Old Valyria|Valyria]] to the island stronghold of [[Dragonstone]] some years prior to the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]]. When the Doom took place, the Targaryens were the only family with [[dragon]]s to survive the cataclysm. During the following century, the remnants of the Valyrian empire tore themselves apart, leading to the formation of the [[Free Cities]] and the liberation of [[Ghiscar]] and the cities of [[Slaver's Bay]].

Roughly one century after the Doom, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] and his sister-wives, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]], were in the island of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. Before Aegon invaded Westeros, the [[Storm King]] [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac]] of [[House Durrandon]], feared that [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] of [[House Hoare]], the [[King of the Iron Islands|ruler]] of the [[Iron Islands]] and [[Riverlands]], would soon attack his lands. Argilac sought an alliance with Aegon, but the communication didn't go well, ending up with Argilac (known as "the Arrogant") amputating Aegon's envoy. This was the excuse that Aegon had been waiting to use his armies and force on Westeros; he sent [[raven]]s to all [[Seven Kingdoms]] demanding their submission. 

Aegon landed strategically at the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush]], in the disputed lands between the [[Riverlands]] and the [[Stormlands]], so that Argilac and Harren could not decide on who should take action against him. He raised a [[Aegonfort|primitive castle]], where three centuries later would be the city of [[King's Landing]]. He unfurled his own banner in the manner of the houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with a red three-headed dragon breathing fire upon a black field, and declared himself King of the whole continent.

===War in the Riverlands===
Aegon's forces made war upon Harren the Black. Aided by a popular uprising against the [[Ironborn]] led by [[House Tully]], Aegon eventually bottled Harren up in his massive castle of [[Harrenhal]]. Harren refused to surrender, considering his castle impenetrable. Aegon had his dragon, [[Balerion]], burn the castle with such ferocity that the towers melted like candles, roasting Harren and the other remaining members of House Hoare alive. Afterwards, Aegon raised the Tullys to become the [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|Lords Paramount of the Trident]] and commanded the Ironborn to elect a new ruling house. They chose [[House Greyjoy]] of [[Pyke]], who swore fealty to Aegon and became the rulers of the Iron Islands.<ref name="VG Ascent of the Dragons">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/ascent-of-the-dragons/ HBO Viewer's Guide, Season 2 appendices Ascent of the Dragons]</ref>

===War in the Stormlands===
At the same time, Aegon's [[bastard]] half-brother, [[Orys Baratheon]], led an army against Argilac the Arrogant. Argilac chose to give battle in the field and was defeated and killed, eliminating House Durrandon. Orys took his castle of [[Storm's End]], his sigil and words, and Argilac's daughter [[Argella Baratheon|Argella]] to wife. Aegon rewarded him by naming him [[Lord of Storm's End]] and allowing him to found [[House Baratheon]].

===War in the West===
The forces of [[House Lannister]] and [[House Gardener]] combined and marched to meet Aegon's army in battle. At a field in the [[Reach]] that became known as the [[Field of Fire]], Aegon unleashed all three dragons and decimated the enemy host within minutes. House Gardener was destroyed. Their stewards, the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]], surrendered the Reach to Aegon and were named [[Lord Paramount of the Reach|Lords Paramount of the Reach]]. The Lannisters also bent the knee and became [[Warden of the West|Wardens of the West]].

===Stand-off with the North and the Vale===
[[House Stark]] mobilized for war, but upon a demonstration of Aegon's superior forces, [[King in the North|King]] [[Torrhen Stark]] bent the knee to save his army from certain destruction. For his submission, Aegon named him Warden of the North. The Starks thus emerged from the war without actually fighting.

Upon the defeat of the Lannisters and the Gardeners, [[House Arryn]] mobilized their army in anticipation of an invasion of the [[Vale of Arryn]]. However, upon seeing a dragon, boy-king Ronnel Arryn surrendered peacefully in exchange for a ride. The Arryns were the last Great House to surrender in Aegon's Conquest.

The [[High Septon]] declared that the [[Faith of the Seven]] would also support Aegon, ending much of the last resistance to the invaders.

===Invasion of Dorne===
Aegon's forces made an abortive attempt to [[First Dornish War|conquer]] [[Dorne]], but the Dornish chose to melt away into the mountains and deserts and pursue guerrilla tactics rather than give open battle, where they would be vulnerable to dragonfire. Aegon eventually decided to allow Dorne to retain its independence, ending his conquest.<ref name="VG Westeros Through The Ages">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/beyond-the-houses/ HBO Viewer's Guide, Season 2 appendices Westeros Through the Ages]</ref>

==In the books==
In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', Aegon's Conquest unfolds much the same as in the novels. However, Martin later expanded the detail of the war significantly in ''The World of Ice and Fire''.

In this book, it was revealed that the Targaryens fled Valyria after [[Daenys Targaryen]] had a prophetic vision of the Doom. Her father, [[Aenar Targaryen|Aenar]], led an exodus to Dragonstone (which had been a Valyrian outpost for two centuries at that time). The prophecy was proved correct when the Doom took place twelve years later.

A century later, Aegon the Conqueror (born 27 years before the Conquest) began making his plans. He visited Westeros in secret and gathered intelligence on the loyalties and divisions between the noble houses. However, the war started due to an act of hostility by the Storm King. Argilac Durrandon proposed an alliance with Aegon against the ironborn, as he feared that once Harren Hoare had completed Harrenhal, he would invade the [[Stormlands]]. Argilac proposed marrying his daughter, Argella (not Argalia, a name invented for the TV series by [[Bryan Cogman]]), to Aegon to cement the deal. Aegon, already married (twice over), instead suggested that Argella marry his half-brother Orys. Argilac, furious, had Aegon's envoy's hands cut off and sent back to him, saying those were the only hands a bastard could expect of him.

Aegon sent [[raven]]s to the rulers of the Seven Kingdoms, demanding their loyalty and threatening them with destruction. Sharra Arryn, Queen-Regent of the [[Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]], instead offered a mutual alliance on the condition that Aegon marry her and make her son, the infant King Ronnel Arryn, his heir. Princess Meria Martell of Dorne offered a military alliance aimed at destroying the Storm King, but nothing more. Aegon ignored both offers.

Aegon's army of fewer than 3,000 troops landed at the mouth of the Blackwater, where he declared himself King of the Seven Kingdoms. In a rapid campaign of movement, his forces quickly captured [[Rosby]], [[Castle Stokeworth|Stokeworth]], [[Duskendale]], and [[Maidenpool]]. He then split his forces in three: the Targaryen fleet commanded by Daemon Velaryon would sail north, escorted by Visenya and her dragon, to land at [[Gulltown]] and begin the conquest of the Vale. Orys and Rhaenys would lead an army south to deal with Argilac. Aegon himself would march on Harrenhal.

The Targaryen fleet was intercepted by the Arryn fleet out of Gulltown, and a furious sea battle took place. The Targaryen fleet was destroyed, but Visenya was able to burn most of the Arryn fleet in retaliation, resulting in a stalemate. It was a strategic victory for the Arryns, however, as they prevented an invasion of the Vale.

Aegon's invasion of the Riverlands was spearheaded by him on dragonback, burning the ironborn longships on the rivers and the [[Gods Eye]] (and killing several of Harren's sons). Impressed, Lord [[Edmyn Tully]] of [[Riverrun]] led a popular uprising against the ironborn. Houses Tully, [[House Bracken|Bracken]], [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]], [[House Mallister|Mallister]], and [[House Frey|Frey]] marched on Harrenhal and joined forces with Aegon. However, even this alliance only gave him 8,000 troops, far too few to take the castle. Harren insulted Aegon and refused to surrender. Aegon burned the castle with Balerion, killing Harren. The ironborn surrendered.

Hearing of Harren's fate, Argilac refused to be slaughtered like an animal and instead chose to give open battle. When a massive thunderstorm erupted as the armies assembled, Argilac took it as a sign and attacked. Outnumbering the Targaryen host 2-1, Argilac's forces gained the upper hand and outflanked Orys's forces. However, Rhaenys and her dragon [[Meraxes]] entered the fray, destroying a part of Argilac's army while Orys engaged Argilac in personal combat and slew him. Argella declared herself the Storm Queen and tried to fight on, but her bannermen betrayed her and handed her over to Orys. Orys treated her with kindness and accepted the surrender of Storm's End.

The Lannisters and Gardeners marched against Aegon's forces. Aegon regrouped with his sister-wives at [[Stoney Sept]] before marching south to the Reach. They destroyed the Host of the Two Kings on the Field of Fire and accepted the surrender of their bannermen. Aegon meant to press on to Dorne with his combined host but then learned that King [[Torrhen Stark]] and 30,000 Northmen were marching south. He rushed north to meet them at the [[Trident]]. Torrhen had planned to give battle, even entertaining a plan put forward by his bastard half-brother Brandon Snow to assassinate the dragons through stealth. Still, upon seeing Aegon's vaster numbers and dragons, he knew he could not subject Westeros to another field of fire. He sent three [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] to negotiate a surrender and then knelt before Aegon, who named him [[Lord of Winterfell]] and [[Warden of the North]].

The Arryns had also assembled a mighty host at the [[Bloody Gate]] and were preparing for war. However, choosing a different tactic, Visenya flew her dragon straight into the courtyard of the [[Eyrie]], where the young boy-king Ronnel was playing. When his mother came out of the castle, she found Visenya had already negotiated the peaceful submission of House Arryn with Ronnel in return for being given a ride on her dragon. The Arryns also bent the knee to Aegon.

Rhaenys led an army into Dorne, only to find the holdfasts empty and the armies of Dorne scattered into small bands that constantly harassed her supply lines. Frustrated, she flew to [[Sunspear]] to confront Princess Meria Martell, the so-called Yellow Toad of Dorne. Meria, eighty years old, blind and almost bald, defied Rhaenys to her face, telling her that Dorne would never surrender. Fearing that the cost of taking Dorne would be ruinous, Aegon agreed to allow it to remain independent.

Aegon triumphantly entered Oldtown and was proclaimed King of Westeros, ending the Conquest after two years.
