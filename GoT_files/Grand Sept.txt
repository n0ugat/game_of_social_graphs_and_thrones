==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the sept atop Visenya's Hill was built during the reign of [[Aegon I Targaryen]] and sponsored by the [[High Septon]] in [[Oldtown]]. It is unknown what exactly happened to it when [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]] built his Great Sept. The sept isn't officially called the "Grand Sept," but is described as a "grander" sept than the one the [[smallfolk]] built in a sunken cog in the [[Blackwater Rush]].

In the approved roleplaying game ''Blood of Dragons'', it is called Visenya's Sept.
