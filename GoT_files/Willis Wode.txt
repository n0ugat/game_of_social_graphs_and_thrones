{{Quote|You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?|[[Catelyn Stark]]|Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things}}
Ser '''Willis Wode'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[Knighthood|knight]] in the service of [[House Whent]]. He helps [[Catelyn Stark]] to apprehend [[Tyrion Lannister]] and dies defending her during her passage through the [[Vale of Arryn]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Ser Willis Wode is sworn to the service of [[House Whent]] of [[Harrenhal]], a vassal house to [[House Tully]]. He is traveling the [[Kingsroad]] following the Tourney of the Hand. He carries a shield emblazoned with the black bat of Harrenhal.{{Ref|GOT104}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Willis is drinking with another man at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrives on his way south. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is also in the inn and Tyrion recognizes her. She turns to the men of her [[Hoster Tully|father]]'s bannermen to help her to take Tyrion into custody, accusing him of attempting to murder [[Bran Stark|her son]]. Catelyn announces that she will return Tyrion to Winterfell to await the King's justice. Ser Willis draws his sword and threatens Tyrion.{{Ref|GOT104}}

He accompanies Catelyn east into the [[Vale of Arryn]], her actual destination. Among the party are the captive Tyrion, the two Lannister men-at-arms who were traveling with Tyrion, Catelyn and her escort Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], the [[Mercenary|sellsword]] [[Bronn]], the singer [[Marillion]], a [[Kurleket|man]] of [[House Bracken]] and six other swordsmen loyal to [[House Tully]]. The party are attacked by warriors from the [[hill tribes]]. Ser Willis dies defending Catelyn. Catelyn, Tyrion, Rodrik, Bronn, Marillion, and two others survive the attack and continue to the Eyrie.{{Ref|GOT105}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Willis Wode is a hedge knight sworn to the service of Lady Shella Whent. He is a stiff necked and stolid man. In contrast to his show counterpart, he survives the journey to the Eyrie, and is present at the duel between [[Vardis Egen]] and [[Bronn]].

In ''A Feast for Crows'', when [[Jaime Lannister]] goes to resolve the [[Second siege of Riverrun|siege of Riverrun]], he passes through the land owned by Wode and his brother, but finds the area devastated by the war and abandoned save for a few outlaws.
