'''Elephants'''{{Ref|GOT707}} are very large mammals native to [[Essos]]. They are commonly used for carrying goods and people over great distances. In [[Volantis]], [[Slavery|slaves]] who are tasked with collecting the dung of elephants and [[horse]]s have flies tattooed on their faces. There is a similar but smaller species known as [[dwarf elephant]]s.{{Ref|H&L503}}

The [[Golden Company]], the largest and best [[Mercenary|sellsword company]] in the [[Free Cities]], fields several war elephants.{{Ref|GOT707}}

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] mentions that the Golden Company, in addition to infantry and cavalry, also uses several war elephants.{{Ref|GOT707}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Upon arriving in [[King's Landing]], [[Harry Strickland]] reports to Cersei that the Golden Company's war elephants could not be transported across the [[Narrow Sea]], much to Cersei's disappointment.{{Ref|GOT801}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, elephants are found throughout the [[Free Cities]] and are not native to [[Westeros]]. They inspired the names of the Isle of Elephants in the [[Jade Sea]] and a party of the [[triarchs of Volantis]].

It is unclear where wild elephants are found, but for centuries they have been imported across Essos as beasts of burden. They tend to be more commonly used in the southern Free Cities, particularly Volantis. They are not described as present in locations farther north such as [[Braavos]], [[Pentos]], or the [[Dothraki Sea]].

Elephants are commonly seen in [[Astapor]] carrying latticework litters on the backs. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] acquires three of them when she takes the [[Great Pyramid of Meereen]] and they remind her of hairless [[mammoth]]s, though with bobbed and guilded tusks and sad-looking eyes. She later sees one kill a pack of six red wolves in [[Great Pit of Daznak|Daznak's Pit]]. In Volantis, they have the names of would-be triarchs painted on their sides during elections. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] sees one for the first time in Old Volantis and cannot help but stare at it. The armies of [[New Ghis]] makes use of elephants, as do the Golden Company. They are also a game piece in [[cyvasse]].
