'''Lannisport'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is a large city located on the west coast of [[Westeros]], on the [[Sunset Sea]] just south of [[Casterly Rock]], the seat of [[House Lannister]]. It is a bustling seaport.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
When Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that there have been disturbing reports from [[Free Folk|wildlings]] trying to flee south of the [[Wall]] that they have seen the mythical [[White Walkers]], Tyrion dismisses the notion that these reports are real by saying that the fishermen of Lannisport also report seeing [[mermaid]]s.<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref>

While trading barbs with [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], Tyrion reminisces about the occasion during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] when [[Raid on Lannisport|Lannisport was attacked]] by the ships of [[House Greyjoy]]. [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s two brothers burned the Lannister fleet as it sat at anchor, prolonging the war until [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] was able to bring the Royal Fleet around from the east coast of Westeros and smash the Greyjoy fleet in open battle. Tyrion recalls seeing the ships burning.<ref>"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
When [[Euron Greyjoy]] comes to [[King's Landing]], proposing a marriage alliance between House Greyjoy and House Lannister against their common enemies, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] reminds him that during the Greyjoy Rebellion, even though Euron and his brother burned the Lannister fleet anchored in Lannisport, the forces of the crown still reached the [[Iron Islands]] and ended the rebellion.<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
During her speech after the [[Battle of King's Landing]], [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] promises her army that they will free the world from tyrants from Lannisport to [[Qarth]].<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==In the books==
Lannisport is located just south of Casterly Rock and is a large and bustling seaport with a population of approximately 250,000, about half the size of King's Landing. It is the third-largest city in Westeros, after King's Landing and [[Oldtown]]. [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and her friends used to sneak into the city while young to see the sights.

Due to its proximity to the Iron Islands, the wealthy Lannisport has often been a target for the [[ironborn]]'s attacks. Over the centuries, they burned Lannisport at least thrice and raided it two dozen times.

During the Greyjoy Rebellion, Victarion Greyjoy cunningly sailed into the harbor at Lannisport and burned the Lannister fleet at anchor.
