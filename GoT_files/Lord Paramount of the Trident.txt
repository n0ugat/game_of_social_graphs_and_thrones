'''Lord Paramount of the Trident''',{{Ref|H&L305}} also known as '''Lord Paramount of the Riverlands''',{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }} is the title held by the head of the [[Great House]] of the [[Riverlands]]. The title takes its name from the [[Trident]], the main river system of the region. Traditionally, the patriarch of [[House Tully]] held the title since the family was elevated to the position by [[Aegon I Targaryen]] in [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]].

When [[King in the North|King]] [[Robb Stark]] went into [[War of the Five Kings|open rebellion]] against the [[Iron Throne]], [[House Tully]] joined him due to the attacks on their lands from [[House Lannister]] and because of their familial ties. Following the [[Red Wedding]] and the end of the Northern rebellion, House Tully has been dispossessed of all lands and titles. [[House Frey]], one of the main participants in the Red Wedding, has been granted the castle and lands of [[Riverrun]] and elevated as the Great House of the Riverlands.

[[Edmure Tully]], after being restored as head of House Tully, currently holds the title after the [[Assassinations at the Twins|death]] of [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Walder Frey]] and [[Assassinations at the Twins|his heirs]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Freys assumed that they would be made the new Lords Paramount of the Trident as a reward for the [[Red Wedding]]. The Lannisters did promise them rule of [[Riverrun]] itself, but snubbed the Freys by giving the title to Petyr Baelish. Littlefinger, meanwhile, hasn't even set foot in the war-torn Riverlands, and simply let the region rot and its people starve while he continued his plotting in the capital and the Vale.
