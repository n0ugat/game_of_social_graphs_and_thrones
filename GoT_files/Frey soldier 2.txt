{{Quote|I bet that there was a thousand men claiming they were the one.|The soldier on the [[Red Wedding]]|Mhysa}}The '''Frey soldier''' was a soldier in service to [[House Frey]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The soldier is relaxing with three other Frey men by a campfire, boasting about the [[Red Wedding]]. [[Frey soldier 1|Another soldier]] in particular mocks the death of [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and the desecration of [[Robb Stark|Robb]]'s corpse, including attaching the head of his [[direwolf]], [[Grey Wind]], to it. This soldier reminds the other that he was the one who did it, to which the other soldier responds in the affirmative. This soldier is then the first to notice [[Arya Stark|Arya]] approaching from behind. After she asks to keep warm, the soldier orders her to "fuck off", until she offers a coin to the other soldier. However, she quickly stabs the other soldier, prompting this soldier and the two others to take up arms. [[Sandor Clegane|The Hound]] intervenes and kills them before they have a chance to hurt Arya.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, this encounter does not occur. However, the Hound does kill some Frey men during the fight at the camp outside the [[Twins]], among them Ser Tytos Frey, son of Jared Frey, and Ser Garse Goodbrook, husband of Kyra Frey.
