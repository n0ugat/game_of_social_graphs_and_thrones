{{Quote|The character breakdown described Gendry as tall and muscular with black hair. I was none of those three at the time. I thought, 'I could dye my hair and hit the gym, but I can't stretch my legs!'... My friend is such a big fan of [[A Song of Ice and Fire|the books]] that even he didn't actually approve of my casting as Gendry. But it was a nice little vote of confidence from [[David Benioff|David]] and [[D.B. Weiss|Dan]].|Joe Dempsie on playing Gendry.<ref>Nguyen, Hanh (April 12, 2012).
