'''Lord Paramount of the Stormlands''',{{Con|TWOI&F}} or simply '''Lord of the Stormlands''',{{Ref|H&L314}} is a title held by the ruler of the [[Stormlands]] from their seat at [[Storm's End]]. The former holder of the title, [[Robert Baratheon]], passed the title to his younger brother [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] after conquering the [[Iron Throne]]. Before Robert, the title was held by their father [[Steffon Baratheon]]. The title has been consistently held by a member of [[House Baratheon]] since [[Aegon's Conquest]].

After Robert and Renly's deaths, the title should have fallen to [[Stannis Baratheon]], the middle brother of Robert and Renly, as the only surviving Baratheon brother. However, with the outbreak of the [[War of the Five Kings]], Stannis declared himself king as he was the rightful heir, and so did not incorporate the title into his official style. Stannis fought against Robert's alleged sons, [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and then [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], who were actually bastards born of incest between Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] and her twin brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. This caused the title of Lord Paramount to remain in dispute between the two branches of House Baratheon.

After the legal extinction of all legitimate Baratheons, Robert Baratheon's unacknowledged [[bastard]] son [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] was legitimized by the decree of Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and named Gendry Baratheon, Lord of Storm's End, also becoming Lord Paramount of the Stormlands.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref> This is upheld by the lords of Westeros even after her [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassination]], shown by Gendry's participation in a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]].<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, the title is granted by the Iron Throne to the liege lord of the stormlands within the Seven Kingdoms.

According to ''The World of Ice & Fire'', [[Argilac Durrandon]], the last [[Storm King]], was killed by Orys Baratheon in the [[Last Storm]] during Aegon's Conquest. [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conquerer]] named Orys the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands and Hand of the King.
