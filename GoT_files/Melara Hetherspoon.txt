'''Melara Hetherspoon'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a childhood friend and companion of [[Cersei Lannister]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Melara was a companion of Cersei Lannister at [[Casterly Rock]], a great honor for a noble girl of the [[Westerlands]].{{Ref|GOT501}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[File:YoungCersei&Melara.jpg|thumb|left|Melara Hetherspoon and Cersei Lannister as young girls]]
Melara reluctantly accompanies Cersei in her visit to [[Maggy]], a [[woods witch]] and reputed fortune teller dwelling in a hut deep in a forest close to Casterly Rock. She watches as Cersei pricks her finger to draw a drop of blood for Maggy to taste and read Cersei's future. Once Maggy finishes her prediction, a terrified Melara tells Cersei they have to leave.{{Ref|GOT501}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Melara Hetherspoon is a daughter of Ser Tybolt Hetherspoon, the head of House Hetherspoon, and a childhood friend of Cersei. She's described as pretty but freckled, and "healthy as a horse". Unlike her portrayal in the series, Melara is described as bold, whereas the reluctant companion of Cersei and Melara is Jeyne Farman, who flees Maggy's tent the minute the woman opens her eyes.

Like Cersei, Melara also asks about her future, asking if she will someday marry [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]. The question angers Cersei, who thinks that Melara is "a greedy little schemer with ideas above her station", and that Jaime is not even aware that she exists. Maggy answers "''Not Jaime, nor any other man. Worms will have your maidenhead. Your death is here tonight, little one. Can you smell her breath? She is very close''". Hearing that, Cersei throws a jar of some thick potion into the old woman’s eyes, and the girls flee.{{Bookref|AFFC|36}}

Melara begs Cersei never to speak of the things they heard that night, promising that if they never talk about it, they'll soon forget, and then it will be just a bad dream they had.{{Bookref|AFFC|36}} 

Melara dies soon afterwards, by drowning in a well.{{Bookref|AFFC|36}} It is heavily implied that Cersei pushed her into the well out of jealousy, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

In the fifth novel, while Cersei performs her [[walk of atonement]], she hallucinates that a young girl in the crowd staring at her with Melara’s accusing eyes.{{Bookref|ADWD|65}}

In the series, the flashback ends before the audience learns if Melara asks her future.
