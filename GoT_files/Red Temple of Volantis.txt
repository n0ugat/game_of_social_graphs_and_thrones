The '''Red Temple of Volantis'''{{Ref|GOT605}} is a place of religious worship for followers of the [[Lord of Light]], located in [[Volantis]]. It is said to be the greatest of such temples in the [[known world]], being even larger than the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] in [[King's Landing]]. All who serve within the temple are [[Slavery|slaves]] who were bought as children, who were trained to become [[red priest]]s, temple [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] and warriors.<ref>"[[Volantis (short)|Volantis]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Temple of the Lord of Light is built on a site that was once a great plaza in the half of [[Volantis]] east of the [[Rhoyne]], near the [[Black Walls]]. It was constructed on an unknown date.

The temple is an enormous structure consisting of pillars, steps, buttresses, domes, bridges and towers flowing into one another, as if chiseled from one colossal rock. The temple walls are covered with a hundred hues of red, yellow, gold and orange. It is written to be three times the size of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. It is protected by a private army of [[Slavery|slave]] soldiers known as the Fiery Hand.

Benerro is the [[High Priest (Lord of Light)|High Priest]], though the [[Golden Company]] were once hired by the [[Triarchs of Volantis|triarch]] Malaquo Maegyr to clean out the temple and put him to the sword. Thousands of slaves and [[freedmen]] (among them [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Jorah Mormont]]) gather in the temple plaza, where he shrieks that [[Red comet|bleeding stars]] and a [[Lightbringer|sword of fire]] will cleanse the world. Benerro's shouting causes women to weep and men to shake their fists, which reminds Tyrion of when the [[riots in King's Landing]] erupted on the day that [[Myrcella Baratheon]] sailed for [[Dorne]].
