Ser '''Addam Marbrand'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the heir of Lord [[Damon Marbrand|Damon]] of [[House Marbrand]] and a bannerman of [[House Lannister]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
A messenger reports news from Ser Addam's outriders to [[Tywin Lannister]]. Ser Addam's scouts have noticed [[Robb Stark]]'s forces have crossed the [[Neck]] and are moving south along the east bank of the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]].{{Ref|GOT108}} Tywin's forces later engage and defeat the Stark force in the [[battle on the Green Fork]]. The Stark army is much smaller than the scouts reported because they separated at the [[Twins]].{{Ref|GOT109}}

Ser Addam is present for a strategy meeting with Tywin following the defeat in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]] by the main portion of the Stark army. Also present are [[Tyrion Lannister|Tywin]], [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], [[Leo Lefford]], [[Harys Swyft]] and another bannerman, as well as Tywin's servant and several Lannister officers. He asks about [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]], and Kevan confirms that both Baratheon brothers have declared against the Lannisters. Later he dismisses suing for a truce so as to not appear weak, and proposes that they march against the Starks instead. Tywin dismisses his bannermen and then announces plans to relocate to [[Harrenhal]].{{Ref|GOT110}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Addam Marbrand is one of the chief knights in the service of Tywin. He is a rangy man, with long, dark copper hair and wears a smoke grey cape.

During his youth, Addam was a page at [[Casterly Rock]] and a childhood friend of [[Jaime Lannister]].

Similarly to the show, Addam attends the council that Tywin holds after the recent defeats at the [[Battle of Whispering Wood|battle in the Whispering Wood]] and the [[Battle of the Camps]]. He is against asking for a truce, stating that two battles do not make a war, and volunteers to try his own steel against "[[Robb Stark|that Stark boy]]". Tywin orders his host to [[Harrenhal]], dispatching Addam's outriders to screen their movements.

Ser Addam is one of Tywin's bannermen present at Harrenhal and departs the ruined castle a day before his liege lord. He survives the Battle of the Fords and joins Tywin in the march south when the latter receives word of [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s imminent attack. After the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Addam is made Commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]]. Tyrion considers this a shrewd move on his father's part, as like his brother Jaime, Addam is both a skilled commander and has the charisma to convince men to follow him into battle.

After Jaime returns to King's Landing, he practices with Addam for a while, but fearing that Addam may get drunk and reveal what poor fighter Jaime is now, he moves to practice with [[Ilyn Payne]].

At Tywin's orders, Addam continues the search for the missing [[Tyrek Lannister]] who disappeared during the [[Riots in King's Landing|riots of King's Landing]], but has no more success than his predecessors.

Addam accompanies Jaime in his mission to resolve the siege of Riverrun. He is quite content to leave the City Watch and command the outriders.
