==Narration==
'''Stannis Baratheon''': ''My brother, [[Robert Baratheon]], had raised the banners of [[Storm's End]], our ancestral castle, against the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King Aerys]].''

''[[Jon Arryn]] of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] and [[Eddard Stark]] of the [[North]] stood with him, and [[Hoster Tully]] of the [[Riverlands]] would join.''

''But their lands were far from [[Stormlands|ours]] and separated by the combined strength of [[Westerlands|the West]], the [[Reach]], and [[King's Landing]] itself. Even Robert's own lords were against him.''

''It was the hardest choice I've ever made: my brother or my king, blood or honor. Aerys ruled by right of all the laws in [[Westeros]]. Everyone knew the price of defiance. But there are deeper, older laws: the younger brother bows before the elder. I followed Robert.''

''Early in the war, [[Mace Tyrell]]'s indecisive [[Battle of Ashford|victory]] at [[Ashford]] cut Robert off from Storm's End. Instead of pursuing Robert, and risking his record, Mace Tyrell turned east and laid [[Siege of Storm's End|siege]] to our home.''

''His vast army and navy encircled us and preventing any resupply by land or sea. If a wagon tried to reach us, it was burned. If a ship tried to land, it was sunk.''

''We were locked inside Storm's End to starve. But Robert had commanded me to hold the castle no matter the cost. He could ill afford to lose his ancient seat, which had never fallen.''

''While Robert [[Battle of the Trident|smashed]] [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] on the [[Trident]], my men ate the dogs because the horses had already been devoured. While the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] [[Sack of King's Landing|sacked]] King's Landing, we ate the rats.''

''If the smuggler [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] had not slipped through the Tyrell blockade with his onions, we'd have [[Cannibalism|eaten our own dead]].''

''But I held the castle until Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] remembered us, and marched to lift the siege. The Tyrells didn't even put up a fight, and Robert threw a feast to celebrate Lord Eddard's "victory."''

''I was sent to the royal [[Dragonstone (island)|island]] stronghold of [[Dragonstone]] to deal with [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], the last surviving [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] children.''

''Before I arrived, however, they had escaped across the [[Narrow Sea]]. Robert was furious. He stripped me of Storm's End and gave it to that prancing fool [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], my younger brother. I could keep Dragonstone.''

''Now Robert is dead, and a [[Joffrey Baratheon|bastard pretender]] soils my [[Iron Throne|throne]] while the [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]] fills with schemers and traitors. But the rightful king is coming for them all, and I will not stop until I have scoured the land clean of abomination.''

''The Baratheons say, "Ours is the Fury." I will show them fury burns.''
