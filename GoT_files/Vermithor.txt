{{Quote|The dragon named Vermithor is the largest in the world after Vhagar, and perhaps the most fierce. He's called the Bronze Fury.|Rhaenyra Targaryen|The Red Sowing}}
'''Vermithor''',{{Note|<small>VƎR</small>-meh-thȯr}} called the '''Bronze Fury''', is a [[dragon]] that belongs to [[House Targaryen]]. He was the mount of King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], and later of the king's [[bastard]] grandson, [[Hugh]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Vermithor was the mount of the Old King, [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys the Conciliator]]. He has bronze scales, orange eyes, and black horns, and is called the "Bronze Fury" for the color of his scales and his ferocious nature.{{Ref|HOTD207}} His mate is [[Silverwing]], the dragon of Jaehaerys's queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]].{{Guideref|Silverwing}} When Vermithor and Silverwing visited the [[Wall]], they refused to fly over it.{{Ref|HOTD201}} After Jaehaerys's passing, Vermithor dwelled in the [[Dragonmont]]. By the time of the [[Dance of the Dragons]] twenty-nine years later, he is the second largest and second oldest dragon in Westeros, after [[Vhagar]].{{Guideref|Vermithor}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
In an effort to find more dragons to gain advantage over the [[Greens]] and their dragons, [[Daemon Targaryen]] visits Vermithor in his lair, singing the [[dragonsong]] "''[[Hāros Bartossi]]''" to get his attention. Vermithor blasts fire above him, but he calms as he and Daemon stare into each other's eyes.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

Vermithor is drawn to the [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] gantry upon listening to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s summons. Rhaenyra calms the growling Vermithor before she leaves and commands the [[dragonseed]]s to claim Vermithor. However, Vermithor massacres most of the dragonseeds by burning and devouring most of them in a fiery rampage. Eventually, [[Hugh]] distracts and stands up to Vermithor, and Vermithor accepts Hugh as his rider. Vermithor later roars alongside [[Silverwing]] and [[Syrax]] to deter [[Vhagar]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] from attacking.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Behind the scenes==
Vermithor was apparently named by [[George R.R. Martin]] after Vermithrax Pejorative,{{Cite}} the dragon in the film ''Dragonslayer'', which he has cited as one of his favorite movies.<ref>[https://geeksofdoom.com/2011/04/16/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martins-top-ten-favorite-fantasy-movies Geeks of Doom: 'Game Of Thrones' Author George R.R. Martin's Top Ten Favorite Fantasy Movies]</ref> Additionally, [[D.B. Weiss]] used the name [[Vermithrax]] for a different dragon.

==In the books==
Vermithor was famously the mount of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the Old King whose great and prosperous reign lasted 55 years. Jaehaerys I's sister-wife Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen]] was also a dragon-rider, and her mount was [[Silverwing]]. It has been speculated that there is some sort of magical/psychic or at least emotional bond between dragons and their riders, so that they like friends of their rider and scorn their enemies. In this case, Vermithor and Silverwing were actually a mated pair, mirroring the marriage between their two riders, and continued to remain so even after their original riders died. They "oft coiled about each other in the fields" when their armies weren't on the move during the Dance. Their matings may have produced some of the younger dragons at the time of the Dance.

At one point Jaehaerys I rode Vermithor on a royal visit to [[Winterfell]], along with Queen Alysanne riding Silverwing, and four other as-yet-unidentified dragons. On a whim, Alysanne rode further up to the [[Wall]] itself, and Jaehaerys I followed on Vermithor.

The novels never give the lineage of any of the Targaryen dragons, though it is fairly clear that Vermithor was one of the powerful second-generation dragons hatched after [[Aegon's Conquest]]. Vermithor was nearly 100 years old during the Dance, putting his hatching somewhere around the years when Aegon I died.

Live-readings that George R.R. Martin has done of his more extensive private notes mention that towards the end of Aegon I's life, there were about half a dozen dragon hatchlings. When Aegon I died several localized rebellions sprang up against his weak older son [[Aenys Targaryen]], but Maegor helped put them down riding [[Balerion]]. Following this, two new dragons hatched at the same time, which was taken as a good omen for relations between the two brothers in the future (which turned out to be false). These two hatchlings may have been Vermithor and Silverwing, given how they were always a pair (Vermithor ultimately grew larger than the previous half-dozen, such as Dreamfyre, but this may just be up to individual variation). This also matches the dates given: if Vermithor was one of the earlier half-dozen dragons he would have been slightly ''over'' 100 years old during the Dance.

In ''A Feast for Crows'', Sam muses that Alysanne visited [[Castle Black]] on her dragon, and Jaehaerys came after her on his own - without mentioning the second dragon's name. This is the only reference to Vermithor in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels.
