{{Quote|House Payne provides us loyal servants.|Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]|The Westerlands}}
'''House Payne'''{{Ref|H&L315}} is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. It is divided into several branches.

House Payne's [[heraldry]] consists of purple and white chequy with gold coins in the checks.

==Members==
* Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], the [[King's Justice]]. Status uncertain.
* Ser [[Podrick Payne]], a [[Knighthood|knight]] of the [[Kingsguard]] of [[Bran Stark|Bran I the Broken]]. A distant cousin of Ser Ilyn from a lesser branch of the family.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Payne is noted as a valued vassal of the Lannisters. Ser Ilyn Payne was a loyal and stalwart warrior in the service of [[Tywin Lannister]] and commander of his personal guard. His tongue was torn out with hot pincers at the order of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], after Ilyn was overheard suggesting that Tywin really ruled the realm (as [[Hand of the King]]) rather than the insane monarch; Tywin wasn't in a position to protest. After the rebellion overthrew the Mad King, [[Robert Baratheon]] made Ilyn the King's Justice (head executioner) as a favor to Tywin.

Podrick is the only other member of the family to appear. He is a very distant cousin of Ser Ilyn's from a different branch of the family. Podrick initially serves as [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s squire; during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], he saves Tyrion from being killed by Ser [[Mandon Moore]]. After Tyrion escapes from prison, Pod looks for him but eventually joins [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] in her search for [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and becomes her squire.
