The '''Crag'''{{Ref|GOT207}} is the stronghold ruled by [[House Westerling]], a vassal of the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. The castle is run-down and partially ruined, as the Westerlings, though an ancient House with blood of the [[First Men]], have fallen on hard times and can no longer maintain it. The castle is located north-east of [[Casterly Rock]], overlooking the [[Sunset Sea]] on the west coast of [[Westeros]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Robb Stark|Robb]] is heading to the Crag to settle [[Surrender of the Crag|its surrender]].{{Ref|GOT207}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Crag is described as being in a state of extreme disrepair, with its defenses compromised by the family's inability to pay for repairs. The Crag is described as lonely, but also has a somewhat romantic quality to it.
