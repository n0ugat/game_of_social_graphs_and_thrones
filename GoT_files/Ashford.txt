'''Ashford'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a settlement in the [[Reach]], the region controlled by [[House Tyrell]] of [[Highgarden]]. It is located on the [[Cockleswhent]] river north east of Highgarden. [[Ashford Castle]] is found there.{{Ref|H&L114}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ashford is the seat of House Ashford. It consists of a castle, a surrounding town and a large meadow nearby which is a perfect location for [[tournament]]s.

In 281 AC, during [[Robert's Rebellion]], Ashford was the site of a major battle and [[Robert Baratheon]]'s only notable defeat. The army of [[House Tyrell]] was advancing towards the [[Stormlands]] with the intention of destroying Robert's army and taking [[Storm's End]]. Robert elected to fight a field battle rather than withstand siege and intercepted the Tyrell army near Ashford. Robert attacked the Tyrell vanguard (which Robert's army outnumbered at a local level, since the bulk of the Tyrell army had not yet arrived). However, Lord [[Randyll Tarly]], commanding the Tyrell van, withstood the attack and drove the Baratheon army from the field. Robert's army was defeated, but managed to withdraw in good order northwards towards the [[Riverlands]]. The Tyrell army was commanded to march on to Storm's End (held by [[Stannis Baratheon]]) and besiege it rather than pursue Robert. This proved unwise, as Robert was able to combine his army with those of the [[House Stark|Starks]], [[House Arryn|Arryns]] and [[House Tully|Tullys]], enabling him to ultimately triumph in the war.
