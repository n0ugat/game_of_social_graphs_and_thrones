Ser '''Harwin Strong''', popularly called '''Breakbones''', was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Strong]]. He was the eldest son and heir of Lord [[Lyonel Strong]] of [[Harrenhal]] and the brother of [[Larys Strong]].<ref>[https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon ''House of the Dragon'' | Official Website for the HBO Series | HBO.com]</ref>

==Biography==
===Background===
Harwin is the heir to Harrenhal, the largest castle in [[Westeros]]. He is said to be the strongest man in all the [[Seven Kingdoms]].{{Guideref|Harwin Strong}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Harwin participates in the royal hunt in the [[Kingswood]] on Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]]'s second [[nameday]]. When Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] returns from the woods covered in blood, with the carcass of the boar she killed in close combat, Harwin grins and looks at her in amazement.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

Approximately a year later, Harwin has joined the [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|City Watch of King's Landing]]. While patrolling the streets of the city, he runs into Rhaenyra, who he mistakes for a boy. Upon recognizing her, he lets her go.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

The Strongs are present during Rhaenyra and Ser [[Laenor Velaryon]]'s pre-wedding feast. Harwin briefly dances with Rhaenyra before being asked by [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] to switch places with him. Later, a brawl breaks out in the throne room between Ser [[Criston Cole]] and Ser [[Joffrey Lonmouth]], sending the crowd into a frenzy. As King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] looks for Rhaenyra, Lyonel gestures Harwin to retrieve the princess and save her from being trampled. Harwin tosses and punches people in the crowd to get to Rhaenyra, then slings her over his shoulder and wades out to safety.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Harwin becomes Lord Commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing]] and Rhaenyra's lover over the next ten years, fathering three [[bastard]] children: [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], and [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]]. Following an incident in the [[Red Keep]]'s training yard in which Harwin attacks Criston Cole for insinuating the illegitimacy of the three princes, Harwin has a heated conversation with Lyonel. Later, Lyonel asks Viserys if he can bring Harwin, who has been dismissed from the City Watch, back to Harrenhal to prepare him to rule their family's seat. The king agrees. After Harwin leaves, Jace asks Rhaenyra if Harwin is his father, to which Rhaenyra replies that he is a [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen]], and that is all that matters.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

At Harrenhal, Lyonel is awakened by a fire set by Larys's agents in the night. Harwin rushes to his father's chamber door, but it has been sealed shut. The ceiling collapses on them, and they both burn to death.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

During [[Laena Velaryon]]'s funeral, Jace, who has already an inkling of his real father's identity, tells his mother that they should be at Harrenhal to mourn Lyonel and Harwin. Rhaenyra answers it would not be appropriate, pointing out that the Velaryons are their kin and the Strongs are not.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[Baela Targaryen]] asks [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] about Harwin in a private conversation, implying she knows Harwin was Jace's biological father. Jace fondly calls Harwin gentle and fierce, and concludes Harwin did genuinely love him and his brothers, to which Baela agrees.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Harwin's great-uncle, Ser [[Simon Strong]] tells Daemon he genuinely believes Harwin and Lyonel's deaths were Larys Strong's handiwork, citing the suspicious nature of the fire that claimed their lives.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

==Personality==
He was a fierce and loyal protector of those he loved.{{Ref|HOTD104}}
