===The Reyne-Tarbeck revolt===
Lord [[Walderan Tarbeck]] [[Marriage|wed]] Lady [[Ellyn Reyne]] following the death of her first husband [[Tion Lannister]]. The Tarbecks and Lady Ellyn's brothers Ser [[Roger Reyne]] and Ser [[Reynard Reyne]], often exploited their liege Lord [[Tytos Lannister]]'s weak will, taking extravagant loans to restore [[Tarbeck Hall]] to its former splendor. They would dismiss Tywin's requests for repayment, with Tytos soon laughing along with them.

Tywin returned from the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], seeking to restore [[House Lannister]] to the position of dominant House of the [[Westerlands]]. He demanded that all debts to them be paid or [[hostage]]s from those who could not pay. Lord Walderan rode to [[Casterly Rock]] to attempt to convince Lord Tytos to undo Tywin's command. However, when he reached the gate he was met by Tywin, who had him thrown in a dungeon.

Lady Ellyn protested and her brothers threatened war, which caused Tytos to release Lord Tarbeck and apologized, as well as forgiving the debts they owed to him. The following year, Tywin demanded that the Reynes and Tarbecks report to Casterly Rock and answer for their crimes, for which the rose in [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt|rebellion]]. Tywin then called his banners and marched on Tarbeck Hall and Castamere.

Lord Walderan had no time to gather his forces and rode against Tywin's army with only household [[Knighthood|knights]]. He was killed alongside his sons and kinsmen, with their heads adorning the spears of the Lannister army as they marched towards Tarbeck Hall. Upon seeing them approach, Lady Ellyn closed the gates and sent [[raven]]s to her brothers at Castamere. She assumed that they would have enough time to muster their armies and break the siege, but Tywin rose trebuchets within a day and within hours had [[Fall of Tarbeck Hall|destroyed]] the keep, crushing Lady Ellyn and her son [[Tion Tarbeck|Tion]]. The Tarbeck forces surrendered and Tywin had the castle put to the torch, signaling the extinction of House Tarbeck.<ref>"[[The Rains of Castamere (Histories & Lore)|The Rains of Castamere]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tarbeck was a [[noble house]] from the [[Westerlands]]. Their seat was [[Tarbeck Hall]], which was located near the [[Crag]]. It has been claimed that their sigil was a seven-pointed star, parts silver parts blue, on silver and blue field.

Lady Jeyne Westerling was [[Marriage|married]] to Lord Alyn Tarbeck prior to her marriage to King [[Maegor Targaryen]]. Lord Alyn was killed by [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon Targaryen]] during the Battle Beneath the [[Gods Eye]].

Ser Adrian Tarbeck who led a force for [[House Lannister]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. Ser Eustace Osgrey recalled that members of his House had married Tarbecks and that the Tarbecks had fought for both sides during the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].

By the reign of King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V Targaryen]], House Tarbeck had been going through a slow decline for centuries. Lord [[Walderan Tarbeck]] and his wife Lady [[Ellyn Reyne]], along with her brother Ser [[Roger Reyne]] and Ser [[Reynard Reyne]], were able to obtain extravagant loans from the weak-willed Lord [[Tytos Lannister]] to rebuild Tarbeck Hall and increase the number of household [[Knighthood|knights]] from twenty to five hundred.

The Reynes and Tarbecks became the Lannisters' most powerful vassals, but they often defied them, with Lady Ellyn openly mocking the betrothal of Genna Lannister and Emmon Frey.

Upon his return from the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]], [[Tywin Lannister]] demanded that all debts owed to the Lannisters be paid, imprisoning Lord Tarbeck in a dungeon when he refused. Lady Ellyn retaliated by two Lannisters of [[Lannisport]] and [[Stafford Lannister]], whose sister [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]] was betrothed to Tywin. Tywin suggested that Lord Walderan be sent back to his wife in pieces, but Tytos agreed to exchange the hostages at [[Castamere]].

The following year, Tywin sent [[raven]]s to Castamere and Tarbeck Hall, demanded that both Houses answer for their crimes. They instead rose in [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt|rebellion]] against the Lannisters. Tywin defeated Walderen's host on the battlefield and had all of the men beheaded before [[Fall of Tarbeck Hall|destroying]] Tarbeck Hall with trebuchets, supposedly smiling as Lady Ellyn and her son [[Tion Tarbeck|Tion]] were crushed within.
