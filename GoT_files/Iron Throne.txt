The '''Iron Throne'''{{Ref|GOT101}} was the throne upon which the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]] sat, located in the [[throne room]] of the [[Red Keep]] in the city of [[King's Landing]]. Besides the monarchs themselves, only their [[Hand of the King|Hand]] could sit on the Iron Throne. The Iron Throne was also a metonym, along with "the crown," referring to the monarchy that rules the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and the authority of the monarchy (e.g. "rebellion against the Iron Throne").

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Orys_Swords.png|thumb|Swords from the defeated enemies at the Last Storm are transported to the Aegonfort to be used in the construction of Iron Throne.]]
The Iron Throne was forged at the order of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], the first of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[King]]s, who [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered six of the seven]] independent kingdoms of [[Westeros]] and unified them under his rule - the seventh kingdom of [[Dorne]] was later joined through a marriage alliance. The throne was allegedly forged from the 1,000 swords that had been surrendered to Aegon in his conquest by the lords who had offered their fealty, though the actual number of the swords in [[300 AC]] is fewer than two hundred.{{Ref|GOT306}} These were subsequently melted down by the fiery breath of Aegon's dragon, [[Balerion]] the Black Dread, then beaten and bent into a throne of imposing appearance, asymmetrical and surrounded by swords protruding from the ground, the steps being decorated with twisted steel.{{Ref|HOTD101}} At some point during or prior to the reign of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], many of the swords that made up the Iron Throne were removed and the throne was given a safer and more symmetrical design.{{Ref|GOT606}}

[[File:Iron Throne Official Guide.jpg|thumb|The Iron Throne as it appeared during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen]].]]
At the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]], during the [[Sack of King's Landing]], as the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army overran the city outside of the Red Keep, Aerys refused to surrender, and secretly ordered the city to be burned to the ground with [[Wildfire plot|hidden caches of wildfire]]. To prevent this, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] killed the Mad King in front of the Iron Throne itself.{{Ref|GOT305}} Greatly disturbed at having killed the king he had taken the most sacred oaths to defend, Jaime then sat down on the Iron Throne and gave no thought to the carnage going on outside. Hours later, the main rebel army arrived in the city, and [[Eddard Stark]] came to the throne room, where he found Jaime sitting on the throne. Years later, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] chided Eddard that he could have tried to seize the throne then and there, instead of letting [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] take it, but he did nothing. Ned never knew why Jaime really killed Aerys, and seeing him seated on the Iron Throne like that gave Eddard the incorrect belief that Jaime hoped to seize the throne himself some day.{{Ref|GOT107}}

=== [[House of the Dragon: Season 1]] ===
After a Small Council concludes, [[Rhaenyra]] and [[Harrold Westerling|Ser Harrold]] head to the throne room, where they find [[Daemon Targaryen|Prince Daemon]] sitting on the Iron Throne. Ser Harrold is shocked by such disrespect, but Rhaenyra, used to her uncle's flippancy, is more amused. Rhaenyra and Daemon converse in [[High Valyrian]], with Daemon, in his own words, noting the irony of Viserys throwing a tournament for his benefit (since until Viserys actually has a son, Daemon is his heir by law) before gifting his niece a bejeweled necklace of [[Valyrian steel]]. <ref name=":0">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 1: "[[The Heirs of the Dragon]]" (2022).</ref>

[[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys I Targaryen]] confronts Daemon in the throne room, seated upon the Iron Throne, the Targaryen sword [[Blackfyre]] in his hand, surrounded by his Kingsguard. Viserys angrily demands to know if Daemon truly mocked his nephew as the "Heir for a Day". Outraged by the insult, Viserys declares his intention to publicly name his heir. When Daemon insists he is his brother's heir, Viserys retorts "''Not anymore"'' and orders Daemon to return to his wife's seat in the Vale. When Daemon steps forward to protest, the Kingsguard draw their swords and block his path, and Daemon grudgingly withdraws. <ref name=":0" />

Before a gathering of the realm's nobility, including the lords of [[House Velaryon|Velaryon]], [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightower]], [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|Stark]], and [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|Baratheon]], Viserys bears witness as the nobles declare oaths of fealty to him and to Rhaenyra as his named heir. <ref name=":0" />

4 years later, a full courtroom of nobles assemble before the Iron Throne, as Viserys puts on his full regalia to formally receive his wayward younger brother. Daemon jauntily enters the throne room, not only still carrying [[Dark Sister]] sheathed at his hip, but playfully tossing the war hammer of [[Craghas Drahar|Craghas Crabfeeder]] in his hand - and wearing his own crown, made of bone and driftwood. As he reaches the base of the throne, Lord Commander [[Harrold Westerling]] draws his own sword and points it slowly into Daemon's chest plate to ward him off. The tension breaks when Daemon throws the war hammer on the ground in front of the Iron Throne and says to add it to the chair (made from the melted weapons of their defeated enemies). Harrold sheathes his own sword, and Viserys points out that Daemon is wearing a crown, inquiring if he also calls himself king. Daemon says that his men hailed him as "[[King of the Narrow Sea]]" after he led them to smash the [[Triarchy]]'s forces and [[War for the Stepstones|conquer the Stepstones]], but he quickly adds that he knows that there is only one true king. Daemon then kneels and offers up both his crown and the [[Stepstones]] to his older brother. Viserys asks what became of [[Corlys Velaryon]], and Daemon says he sailed back home to [[Driftmark]] (not bothering to present himself at the royal court, due to his rift with Viserys). Viserys also asks who now holds the Stepstones, to which Daemon replies the tides, the crabs, and the corpses of 2000 Triarchy corsairs left staked on the shore as a warning to any who might follow Drahar's example. Viserys comes down from the throne, with his sheathed sword [[Blackfyre]] in hand, and is at first hesitant about what to do. After a moment, he orders Daemon to rise, and the two brothers embrace. The entire court applauds their reconciliation, save for a displeased [[Otto Hightower]].<ref name=":1">''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 4: "[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]" (2022).</ref>

Still several hours later, a somewhat more sober Daemon stumbles through the gates of the Red Keep, only to be immediately seized by [[Harrold Westerling]] and two other Kingsguard, to bring him to an audience with the king. The guards roughly drop the still semi-coherent Daemon onto the floor of the throne room. The guards leave, then Viserys appears from a side doorway. He accuses that Daemon defiled his daughter and gives him a swift kick in the ribs, asking if he will even attempt to deny it. Viserys bitterly accuses that it's not Rhaenyra that Daemon wants, but the Iron Throne. Viserys rises, and dismissively tells Daemon to go back to the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] and his lawful wife, and to try to restore what scrap of honor he may have left; or not, it makes no difference to him, as he never wants to see Daemon again.<ref name=":1" />

The feast is held in the throne room itself. Envoys from all the major [[Noble house|noble houses]] of the realm are announced in turn by Ser [[Harrold Westerling]] as they enter, such as Lord [[Jason Lannister]]<nowiki/>and Lord [[Hobert Hightower]] (with the notable absence of Otto). Viserys and Rhaenyra sit at the middle of the high table set up in front of the throne's base and receive each in group, though Queen Alicent is noticeably late and has yet to arrive. By the end Joffrey has been beaten to death. Later that evening, [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]] and Rhaenyra are married in a private ceremony while Joffrey's blood is still warm. <ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 5: "[[We Light the Way]]" (2022).</ref>

During an audience in the throne room, with Otto Hightower sitting on the Iron Throne as [[Hand of the King]] owing to [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys]] being bedridden, Vaemond makes the case that he is a true Velaryon and the closest kin of Corlys whereas Rhaenyra's sons are not. Before Rhaenyra has time to make her own case, Viserys enters the throne room to the surprise of everyone present and takes charge of the proceedings. Realizing that he has no chance of convincing the king to disinherit his own grandchildren, Vaemond becomes irate and aggressive, shouting that Rhaenyra's children are [[Bastard|bastards]] and calling Rhaenyra herself a "whore." Vaemond's slander of the royal family is deemed to be treason and Viserys threatens to remove Vaemond's tongue himself. Before he is able to, Daemon decapitates him from behind using [[Dark Sister]].<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 8: "[[The Lord of the Tides]]" (2022).</ref>

Otto has the nobles present at court herded into the throne room and informs them of Viserys's purported change of his successor, insisting they bend the knee and swear allegiance to Aegon. [[Lord Merryweather]] and [[Lady Fell]] refuse to break their oaths to Rhaenyra and are imprisoned. Lord [[Allun Caswell]] feigns allegiance.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 9: "[[The Green Council]]" (2022).</ref>

He is flanked by his cronies [[Martyn Reyne]], [[Leon Estermont]], and [[Eddard Waters|"Red Ned" Waters]]. Aegon is polite and even sympathetic to the petitioners, as he desperately wants approval as a good king, but he is inexperienced at rule and his grandfather Otto keeps correcting him. Later in the evening, Aegon is drinking with his cronies after a stressful day of petitions.<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]], Episode 1: "[[A Son for a Son]]" (2024).</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[George R.R. Martin]] expressed in his blog that the appearance of the Iron Throne in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' isn't what the Iron Throne looks like in the world of the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels.<ref name="GRRM about Iron Throne">[http://grrm.livejournal.com/327569.html George R.R. Martin's blog: The Real Iron Throne]</ref>

In the TV series, the Iron Throne is the size of a very large chair, is reasonably symmetrical, and Littlefinger remarks in Season 3's "[[The Climb]]" that it doesn't literally contain thousands of swords, he has counted and there are under two hundred.
[[File:Marc Simonetti Bran theironthroneJoffCloseup.jpg|thumb|Closeup of Mark Simonetti's artwork depicting the Iron Throne, singled out by Martin as closely representing the imposing size and appearance of the throne in the books (click to expand).]]
[[File:Marc Simonetti Bran theironthroneJoff.jpg|thumb|Artwork by Mark Simonetti of the throne room in the books, which is on the scale of St. Peter's basilica (click to expand).]]
Martin explained that the physical proportions of the Iron Throne in the books, as well as the throne room it is set in, are simply unfilmable due to their massive size. The throne room in the books is the size of [[Wikipedia:St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]] at the Vatican, and the Iron Throne itself towers over forty feet in height. The book version of the Iron Throne ''actually does'' contain a thousand swords, taken from Aegon the Conqueror's fallen enemies, and the visual symbol of subsequent Targaryen kings who sat atop that many swords of vanquished foes was a truly awesome sight to behold. Even the actual seat where the king sits is located over twenty feet off of the ground, and needs to be reached by an entire flight of stairs.

The Iron Throne is so large that it is ''physically impossible'' to move it. Aegon I eventually decided to raze the boomtown that had grown up around the site of his army's landing camp, a ramshackle town of wood and earth called "The Aegonfort", so that he could start over from scratch and construct a more permanent new capital city, [[King's Landing]]. The Red Keep itself and the throne room had to be built ''around'' the preexisting Iron Throne. The construction took many years and would continue long after his death, so in the meantime, he relocated the royal court to his ancestral castle on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. It was impossible to move the Iron Throne, however: when Aegon I died his son and successor [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys]] had to travel to the unfinished construction site of King's Landing to be crowned on the Iron Throne, before then moving back to Dragonstone. This is also why no one ever tried to steal the Iron Throne and take it elsewhere during civil wars, i.e. when one side or the other seized the capital during the Dance of the Dragons, or during Robert's Rebellion, no attempt was made by the defenders to sneak the throne out of the capital along with other royal emblems such as the king's crown.

Moreover, Martin made the point that the Iron Throne in the books was hammered together by blacksmiths, not sculptors and artisans, so it does not fit together neatly: rather, it is a sprawling and twisting asymmetrical stack of swords welded together into a vague throne-shape and towering into the air. Aegon the Conqueror did "build" the Iron Throne in that he commissioned it, and more specifically in that he used the fire of his dragon [[Balerion]] to melt down the swords and make them malleable, after which the blacksmiths would take them and add them to the growing construct.

Martin was nonetheless entirely sympathetic to the practical necessities faced by the TV production team: the throne room as he envisioned it may be the size of St. Peter's Basilica, but the TV series already films in the largest studio set in all of Europe, the [[Paint Hall]] in Belfast. He acknowledged that the book version of the Iron Throne is so massive it would have difficulty fitting in any set, and even if it did, it might visually detract from the drama for the king to be holding conversations with people on the ground a full forty feet away from him. Martin also stated that he actually very much enjoys the design used for the Iron Throne in the TV series - it simply would have been physically impossible to replicate the towering edifice he described in the books.

In 2013, Martin pointed out a painting by Marc Simonetti (see at right) as coming closer than any previous artwork to what the Iron Throne and the throne room look like as Martin envisions them in the books.<ref name="GRRM about Iron Throne">[http://grrm.livejournal.com/327569.html George R.R. Martin's blog: The Real Iron Throne]</ref>

In 2014, a small replica of the TV series's Iron Throne was given to Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, on a visit to Paint Hall. The Queen declined an invitation to sit upon the actual Iron Throne prop, although she was photographed inspecting it and other props from the series.<ref>http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-28002746</ref> As [[David Benioff]] later explained, she did not sit on the Iron Throne prop because "Apparently the Queen of England is not allowed to sit on a foreign throne - This is an esoteric rule we didn't know about until that moment." [[D.B. Weiss]] agreed that this seemed odd because the prop is a ''fictional'' throne for a fictional kingdom.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/why-queen-elizabeth-didnt-take-the-iron-throne-and-more-game-of-thrones-interview-and-casting-details/]</ref>[[File:HotD Iron Throne Concept Art 1.png|thumb|Iron Throne Concept Design]]A Season 4 blooper reel revealed that during the trial scene in "[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]", [[Charles Dance]] (Tywin) gripped the pommel of one of the swords making up the Iron Throne so hard (because Tywin is angry) that it accidentally snapped off - he then looked down at it in his grip and swore, embarrassed that he had just broken the Iron Throne prop.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/watch-new-game-thrones-season-4-bloopers/]</ref>
For ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', the throne was redesigned to have a more menacing appearance and to be more true to George R.R. Martin's original vision. Designed by [[Jim Clay]], the new throne stands 2 feet taller than the one in ''Game of Thrones'' and is surrounded by approximately 2,000 swords, variously bent, melted, and protruding.<ref>''[[Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon: Inside the Creation of a Targaryen Dynasty]]'' - The Red Keep</ref>

==In the books==

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Iron Throne is reportedly uncomfortable to sit upon due to the blades that radiate out from it, occasionally cutting the incumbent. The moral lesson Aegon intended for his heirs was that no ruler should ever sit upon the throne carelessly, just as they must not rule carelessly. The Iron Throne specifically contains the swords of those Aegon defeated in battle, but not of those who had surrendered honorably rather than give battle. As such, no swords from the [[North]] or the [[Vale of Arryn]] were included in the Iron Throne thanks to [[Torrhen Stark]] and [[Sharra Arryn]].

Aerys's increasing insanity over the years led him to absentmindedly sit upon the throne with his full weight, frequently cutting and injuring himself. Ultimately he cut and scraped himself so much upon the Iron Throne that his personal enemies derisively referred to him as "King Scab", besides of his more common epithet, "the Mad King". This was seen by some as a sign of his unworthiness to rule.

At the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]], Aerys was slain by Jaime at the foot of the Iron Throne itself. Jaime proceeded to wait out the rest of the [[Sack of King's Landing|sack of the city]] by Lannister soldiers, and waited in the throne room for the late arrival of Eddard Stark and the main rebel army. Eddard's most powerful memory of the event was arriving in the throne room to find Jaime sitting on the Iron Throne, his sword at his side still covered in Aerys' blood, with the Mad King's corpse lying in a pool of his own blood in front of the throne. On seeing Eddard, Jaime got off the Iron Throne, joking that he was just keeping it warm for [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]].
