{{Dialogue a-b|Theon|Where is he?|Myranda|Who, my lord? There's no one here but you, me, and Violet.|[[Theon Greyjoy]] and [[Myranda]]|The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)}}
'''Violet''' was a young woman in service to [[House Bolton]] at the [[Dreadfort]], and a bedwarmer of [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Violet and [[Myranda]] enter the torture cellar in which [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] is kept hostage, release him and put him on a bed. They then attempt to seduce him, claiming that they have heard the heir to [[Pyke]] is "well-endowed". Violet claims Myranda was in training to become a [[septa]], but her sexual urges kept her from taking the vows. Theon is initially distrustful, but cannot help but grow aroused when Myranda, stripped of her clothes by Violet, straddles him.{{Ref|GOT307}}

Suddenly, the girls are interrupted by a horn sounded by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]], who approaches his two servants and taunts Theon, telling him he too has heard about Theon's manhood and showing him a gelding knife. Myranda and Violet then watch as Theon is held by two men, while Ramsay proceeds to geld him.{{Ref|GOT307}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
While bathing [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], Myranda reveals Ramsay grew tired of Violet and killed her after she became pregnant, which Ramsay found "boring."{{Ref|GOT506}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[George R.R. Martin]] stated on the DVD commentary of "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" that he had written a scene involving Myranda and Violet for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth season]]. Stephanie Blacker was not available for the fourth season due to pregnancy. Since Martin wrote "[[The Lion and the Rose]]," this seems to suggest that the role played by [[Tansy]] in the episode was originally intended for Violet. Violet's in-universe fate might be a reference to Blacker's real-life reason for not returning.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the only character named Violet is an old peasant woman who used to visit [[Riverrun]], looking for old shoes in need of new soles. She does not appear in the books, being only mentioned by [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and Maester Vyman.

In the novels, Ramsay surrounds himself with a group of brutal thugs, referred to as the "Bastard's Boys", who take part in his mind games and tortures. However, there is no mention of any women in the group.
