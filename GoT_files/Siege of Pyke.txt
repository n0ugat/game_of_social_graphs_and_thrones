The '''Siege of Pyke'''{{Ref|GOT802}} was the final battle of the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], taking place approximately nine years before the [[War of the Five Kings]]. The castle of [[Pyke]], the ancestral stronghold of [[House Greyjoy]], was taken by forces loyal to King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert I Baratheon]] in an assault after a siege.

==History==
===Background===
During the final stages of the rebellion, The Iron Islands were outnumbered by ten to one.<ref name=":0">"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref> As Pyke was facing an assault, [[Thoros]], a [[red priest]] of the [[Lord of Light]], with his fire-coated sword, led the way through a breach in the castle walls with [[Jorah Mormont]] not far behind him. [[Eddard Stark]], the Lord of Winterfell, and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] also fought for the iron Throne during the battle.<ref name="Siege of Pyke">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/map/special/battleground-westeros/3/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 special features, Battleground Westeros - Siege of Pyke entry]</ref>[[Maron Greyjoy]], Balon's second son and heir after [[Rodrik Greyjoy]]'s death, was killed in the fighting at Pyke, when he was crushed by a collapsing tower.<ref name="viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/greyjoy-rebellion/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 appendices, Greyjoy Rebellion entry]</ref>

With Pyke having been invaded and sieged, it ultimately resulted in a final defeat for House Greyjoy in the rebellion and Balon was forced to surrender. He was accepted back into the king's peace by Robert, but only on the condition that his last surviving son, the eight-year-old [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], be made a ward of [[House Stark]] as a hostage. The victory at Pyke cemented and secured Robert's hold on the Iron Throne, after having overthrown the Targaryen Dynasty a few years before.<ref name="viewers guide"/> He then made Jorah a knight for his valor in the battle.<ref name="Siege of Pyke"/>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Jaime and [[Jory Cassel]] reminisce about the battle, recalling how Thoros led the charge through a breach in the wall, wielding his flaming sword. Jaime recalls it was a hard fight against a skilled enemy.<ref name=":0" />

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Jorah Mormont]] and [[Barristan Selmy]] discuss the siege, with Jorah remembering Thoros and his flaming sword. They also talk about the moment when Robert knighted Jorah, which Jorah considers the proudest moment of his life, although he also had an incredible need to urinate while Robert pronounced the oath.<ref>"[[Kissed by Fire]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
While trying to auction Jorah to slavers, [[Malko]] correctly states that Jorah took part in the siege; however, he misnames Pyke as "Spike" and incorrectly claims that Jorah was the first through the breach and the one who wielded the flaming sword (instead of Thoros).<ref>"[[The Gift]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
During a fiery argument between Balon and [[Yara Greyjoy]] about the unsuccessful invasion to the North, Yara reminds her father how his previous campaign ended: the mainland armies breached their walls and knocked down their towers, her brothers Maron and Rodrik were killed that day (actually, Rodrik was killed earlier, during an [[assault on Seagard]]).<ref>"[[Home]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
When [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]] arrives in King's Landing to propose a marriage-alliance with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], Jaime is perturbed by his presence and brings up the Siege of Pyke. They recount it at some length, and Euron remarks that he was in awe of Jaime's swordsmanship that day when he crossed into the breach in the castle, which truly lived up to all the stories about Jaime's reputation. Jaime is disgusted at this, pointing out that the men he was killing were Euron's own kinsmen (lesser cousins of the main family). Euron flippantly concedes that he didn't mind, for the castle was getting too crowded.<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

While traveling beyond the Wall [[Wight hunt|to capture a wight]], Jorah and Thoros relate to the battle. Jorah praises Thoros for his outstanding bravery, and asks him jokingly how drunk he was when he charged through the breach on Pyke. Thoros answers he cannot remember that; he was told about it the next morning.<ref>"[[Beyond the Wall]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
In the hours before the [[Battle of Winterfell]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] recounts the battles and engagements that Jaime, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]], and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] participated in, calling Jaime the "fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."<ref>"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"</ref>

==In the books==
﻿In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the siege of Pyke was similarly the final stage of the Greyjoy Rebellion. Despite an early success (the [[Raid on Lannisport|burning the Lannister fleet]] at anchor), the Greyjoys were [[Sea battle off Fair Isle|defeated at sea]] by [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s fleet and forced to withdraw to Pyke. The forces loyal to King Robert breached the walls with siege ships and charged through the breach. Once it was clear that the battle was lost, Balon Greyjoy surrendered and [[Bending the knee|bent the knee]] in fealty to Robert once more.

There is no mentioning in the novels that Jaime and Jory participated in the fighting against the Greyjoys, either during the siege or any other stage of the Greyjoy Rebellion. In addition, Theon was nine years old at the time of the siege.
