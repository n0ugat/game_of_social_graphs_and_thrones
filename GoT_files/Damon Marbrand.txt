{{Quote|This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.|[[Tywin Lannister]]|The Old Gods and the New}}
'''Damon Marbrand''' is the head of [[House Marbrand]]. He is a bannerman of [[House Lannister]] and the father of Ser [[Addam Marbrand]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Due to [[Amory Lorch]]'s nigh-illiteracy, a letter from [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] to Damon is accidentally sent to [[Marlyn Dormand]], a vassal of [[House Stark]].{{Ref|GOT206}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, little is mentioned of Damon Marbrand. He is not present at his seat during the [[taking of Ashemark]], with a [[castellan]] holding the castle instead.
