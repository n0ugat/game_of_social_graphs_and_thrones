==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mistwood (also "Mistfall") is the seat of House Mertyns. Their only claim to fame is that they once produced a famous member of the [[Kingsguard]], Ser Michael Mertyns, the White Owl.

Mistwood is located on Cape Wrath, in the Rainwood. It is located inland from the [[Sea of Dorne]].

In "Arianne II" sample chapter of the sixth novel, Arianne finds out that a force of the [[Golden Company]] has captured Mistwood on behalf of the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia who has returned to Westeros to claim the [[Iron Throne]].
