===Background===
Ternesio Terys is the captain of the ''[[Titan's Daughter]]'', a trading galleon from [[Braavos]].{{Ref|GOT410}}

===​[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Arya Stark]] approaches Terys at a small port in [[Saltpans]] and asks him if he'll give her passage to the [[Wall]]. She is willing to pay or scrub the floors of the [[Ships|ship]] in return. He tries to dissuade her from visiting the [[North]], opining that it is a land of "ice, war and pirates". Besides, he says his ship is actually bound for his home, [[Braavos]]. Arya remembers the iron coin and the instructions that [[Jaqen H'ghar]] had given her following her escape from [[Harrenhal]], and shows the coin to him, whispering "''valar morghulis''". Terys, astounded, responds with "''valar dohaeris''" and promises her a cabin.{{Ref|GOT410}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
After a long sea voyage, Ternesio and Arya Stark arrive at the city of Braavos. She is awestrack by the [[Titan of Braavos|Titan]], so he tells her that, in the old times, whenever Braavos stood in danger, the Titan would wake and protect the city. Arya replies it's just a statue, and just then the Titan lets out a loud blast announcing their arrival, startling her, so the captain laughs. Terys personally brings Arya to the [[House of Black and White]], where he claims she may find [[Jaqen H'ghar|the man she seeks]]. Arya thanks Terys for bringing her this far and he responds that any man of Braavos would have done the same. They say their goodbyes, and he rows away.{{Ref|GOT502}}
