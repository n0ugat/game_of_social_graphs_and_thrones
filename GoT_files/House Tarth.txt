'''House Tarth'''{{Ref|GOT208}}{{Note|Selwyn's surname is Tarth.}} of [[Evenfall Hall]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]]. The family controls the island of [[Tarth]], which lies in the [[Narrow Sea]] just off the coast of the [[Stormlands]].

House Tarth is ruled by Lord [[Selwyn Tarth]], a widower. His sole surviving child and former heir is [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], whom he dotes on. Brienne, a tall and broad-shouldered woman, prefers the lifestyle of a warrior to that of a typical daughter of a noble house, and is skilled at arms.

House Tarth's [[heraldry]] consists of yellow suns on rose quartered with white crescents on azure. Their words are not known.

==Members==

[[File:House Tarth ASOIAF.svg|thumb|200px|right|The Tarth coat of arms in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels: quarterly, first and fourth a yellow sun on rose, second and third a white crescent moon on blue.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Tarth has been a loyal vassal of the Baratheons for many generations. With King [[Robert Baratheon]] away at court and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] serving as Lord of [[Dragonstone]], the Tarths, like most of the Stormlander houses, regard [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], the Lord of Storm's End, with greater loyalty and affection than his two brothers.

Brienne is the oldest daughter of Lord Selwyn. She had two younger sisters but they both died in the cradle. She had an older brother named Galladon, but he drowned when she was eight years old, leaving her as Selwyn's only surviving child and heir. In Season 5 of the TV series, Brienne does say that she is her father's only "surviving" child, apparently a nod to this fact from the books.

After Renly dies, it isn't clearly stated whom Lord Selwyn and House Tarth officially support. Selwyn certainly didn't send troops to aid Stannis, but it's unclear if he bent the knee to Joffrey, outright lent his support to him, or simply adopted an isolationist stance, like Lord Gulian Swann.

House Tarth is said to have blood ties to Houses Durrandon and Baratheon, and more recently to [[House Targaryen]], but the exact details of these relations are unclear as of yet.

House Tarth's coat of arms is different in the novels: the sun is in the first and fourth, and the moon in the second and third. In the TV series, it is the opposite. In the novels, there is also no sun in the center.
