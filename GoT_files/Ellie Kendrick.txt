{{Quote|I don’t want to sign up for this part and find out that I like die or have to get naked two episodes down the line (laughs) as sometimes happens, and so I looked at all of my parts in the books because my character accompanies Bran. … There’s so much rich description of all of the characters and it’s actually incredibly useful as an actor, to be able to read that and be like, "Great! Thanks! Thanks, George R.R. Martin. You’ve done all the work for me!"|Ellie Kendrick on playing [[Meera Reed]]<ref>[http://www.accesshollywood.com/game-of-thrones-qanda-ellie-kendrick-talks-playing-ultimate-tomboy-meera-reed_article_79063 Access Hollywood]</ref>}}
