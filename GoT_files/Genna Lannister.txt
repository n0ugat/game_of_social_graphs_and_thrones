'''Genna Lannister''' is the only daughter of [[Tytos Lannister|Tytos]] and [[Jeyne Marbrand|Jeyne Lannister]] and a younger sister of [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] and [[Kevan Lannister]].<ref name="finalebook">[https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/season-8-episode-6-series-finale-props-song-of-ice-and-fire See] the family tree of [[House Lannister]] in Archmaester [[Ebrose]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' (as featured in "[[The Iron Throne]]")</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Genna is featured in the family tree of House Lannister in Archmaester [[Ebrose]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.<ref name="finalebook" /> She is not mentioned or featured elsewhere in the series.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Genna's genealogy and relation to the other Lannisters are the same. 

While the family tree in the Season 8 prop explicitly shows Genna as unmarried and without children, in the books she is married to Emmon Frey, the second son of [[Walder Frey]], and has four Frey sons: Cleos ([[Alton Lannister]]'s book counterpart), Lyonel, Tion, and Walder. 

When Genna was seven years old, her father was persuaded by Lord [[Walder Frey]] to betroth her to Walder's second son Emmon. Tywin, who was ten years old, spoke out against the match (the Freys were vassals of [[House Tully|another Great House]], thus the status of House Frey was far below House Lannister, and Emmon was not even Lord Frey's heir); his defiance unnerved both Tytos and Walder, though the betrothal remained standing. Genna did not approve of all Tywin did, nor enjoyed the company of the man he later became, yet she adored him for being the only person to speak out against her betrothal.

Genna once told Tywin that Tyrion, whom he strongly disliked and unjustly blamed for [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]]'s death, resembled him the most; Tywin grew so angry he refused to speak to Genna for six months.

Genna was well-liked by her father and later by Tywin as well, until she and Tywin fell out over the matter of Tyrion, but retains a prominent position in Lannister family affairs, taking a prominent role during her nephew [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]'s [[Second siege of Riverrun|campaign in the Riverlands]], and a position on his war council. She is deeply scathing of many of her niece Cersei's decisions as regent to King Tommen, particularly Cersei's willingness to offend the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] (knowing how dangerous an enemy they can be) and allowing the [[High Sparrow]] to reform the Faith Militant, given [[Faith Militant uprising|the trouble they caused]] for the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]]. 

In ''A Storm of Swords'', two of Genna's sons are killed: Cleos is shot by outlaw archers while escorting Jaime and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] to [[King's Landing]]; Tion is killed alongside his cousin [[Willem Lannister]] by [[Rickard Karstark]] (in the show he was replaced with another cousin, [[Martyn Lannister]]).
