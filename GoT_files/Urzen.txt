'''Urzen''' was an [[Ironborn]] raider and a member of the ''[[Sea Bitch]]'' crew. He took part in the [[capture of Winterfell]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Urzen is present when [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] gives a speech encouraging his crew to resist the [[Northmen]] led by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]], and to die a glorious death.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] learn that the Ironborn captured at Winterfell were all [[Flaying|flayed]] alive on Ramsay's orders, despite being promised mercy if they surrendered.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Urzen's background is the same. He is among the ironborn who raid the [[Stony Shore]] and part of the force that [[Capture of Winterfell|captures Winterfell]].

As Theon's position becomes hopeless, he tells the ironborn they can leave and join [[Yara Greyjoy|his sister]]'s troops at [[Deepwood Motte]] or stay and fight with him against the Northmen, who will arrive soon to retake Winterfell. Urzen is among those who choose to leave.

Urzen is not mentioned in the books afterwards.
