The '''''Myraham'''''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a [[merchant]] [[Ships|ship]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The [[Ships|ship]] transports [[Theon Greyjoy]] from [[Seagard]] in the [[Riverlands]] to [[Lordsport]] on [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]]. Theon has a brief affair with the [[captain's daughter]] while onboard.<ref>"[[The Night Lands]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the ''Myraham'' is a fat-bellied trading cog from [[Oldtown]], carrying fruit, spices, wine from the [[Arbor]], cloth, seed, feathers from the [[Summer Isles]] and musical instruments to trade for iron ore. Her captain is fat-bellied southron merchant.

Once the captain concludes his business, he discovers that the ''Myraham'' and other merchant vessels are not allowed to depart at [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s order; Balon wants no word of the hosting of the warships to reach the mainland before he is ready to strike. Thus the ''Myraham'' is detained for more than six months at Lordsport.

In the third novel, during the chaos resulting from [[Assassination of Balon Greyjoy|Balon's death]] and [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]]'s return, the captain slips anchor and returns to Seagard. Later he tells the Starks about the aforementioned events.
