The '''Brimstone'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a river in southern [[Dorne]]. It runs through the desert and empties into the [[Summer Sea]]. The castle of [[Hellholt]] is located on its banks.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Brimstone appears to have its source directly in the desert of southern Dorne, which seems to be unlikely. The source of the river may originate in the [[Red Mountains]] further north.  Despite being the only major river in central Dorne it is of little comfort to those who must pass through the harsh desert:  the waters of the river are sulphurous.
