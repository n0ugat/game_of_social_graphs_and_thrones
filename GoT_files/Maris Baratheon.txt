'''Maris Baratheon'''{{Con|F&B}} is a noblewoman of [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]].

==Biography==
Maris is the second daughter of Lord [[Borros Baratheon]], and has three other sisters.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

==Family==
{{Baratheon tree (House of the Dragon)}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Maris was a daughter of Lord Borros Baratheon. She and her sisters were collectively known as the "Four Storms." Maris was the cleverest of the sisters, but less comely than the other three.

Maris was indirectly responsible for [[Lucerys Velaryon|Luke]]'s death: after he left Storm's End, Maris (who was upset Aemond did not choose her for a wife) taunted Aemond: "Was it one of your eyes he took, or one of your balls? I am so glad you chose my sister. I want a husband with all his parts." Hearing that, Aemond became so furious that he chased Luke and killed him. According to the royal fool Mushroom, known for his exaggerations, Aemond then returned to Maris and presented Luke's eyes to her on a bed of seaweed.
