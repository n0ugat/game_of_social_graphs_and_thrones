'''''Khaleesi'''''{{Ref|GOT101}} is a [[Dothraki]] title referring to the wife of the ''[[khal]]''.

==History==
A ''khaleesi''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s status varies greatly from ''[[khalasar]]'' to ''khalasar''. She could be very influential, riding beside her husband as he leads, or she could be worth practically less than the ''khal''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horse; the ''khal''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[bloodrider]]s will sometimes share the ''khaleesi'', but would never be allowed to ride the ''khal''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s horse.

It is Dothraki tradition that when a ''khal'' dies, his surviving ''khaleesi'' must retire to join the crones that rule [[Vaes Dothrak]], known as the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]''. [[Daenerys Targaryen]], however refused this and instead declared herself a Khaleesi in her own right, forming her own ''khalasar'' from what few of Drogo's people hadn't abandoned her.

As she continued on her journey, Daenerys more formally pressed her claim to the [[Iron Throne]] and thus emphasized the title she felt she had a birthright to, [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen of the Andals and the First Men]]. She nonetheless continued to claim her Dothraki title, and made sure that "''Khaleesi'' of the [[Dothraki Sea|Great Grass Sea]]" was included amongst her titles when she was formally announced. It's not clear where the territorial designation "of the Great Grass Sea" comes from; it may originate from Dothraki tradition, but could simply be Daenerys's own attempt to make the title seem more formal.

Daenerys's claim to the ''khaleesi'' title was challenged by Khal [[Moro]] upon her capture. Since the widow of a ''khal'' is by definition a ''khaleen'' and not a ''khaleesi'', Moro felt honor-bound to bring her back to Vaes Dothrak. Since she had not returned to immediately join their ranks, the ''Dosh Khaleen'' decided to have the ''khali'' decide what to do with her during the ''[[Khalar Vezhven]]''. Although Moro tried to convince the assembled horse lords to let her join the ''Dosh Khaleen'', Daenerys decried all the ''khali'' as weak and killed them in a great conflagration, declaring herself the sole leader of the Dothraki. It is not clear if she is now the only holder of the title, as she had previously indicated that she thought ''Dosh Khaleen'' such as [[Ornela]] should still hold the title of ''khaleesi''.<ref>"[[Book of the Stranger]]"</ref> [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is the first in known Dothraki history and lore to transform the role of ''khaleesi'' from consort to sovereign, regardless if any other woman currently hold the title.

==In the books==
According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "''khaleesi''" is pronounced "khal-EE-see". However, professional linguist [[David J. Peterson]], who developed the Dothraki language for the TV series, states that the word's proper pronunciation is "KHAH-lay-see".<ref>https://twitter.com/Dedalvs/status/1321876436454641665</ref> The <span class="plainlinks">[http://wiki.dothraki.org Dothraki Wiki]</span> supports the "KHAH-lay-see" pronunciation.<ref>http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonotactics#Stress</ref><ref>http://wiki.dothraki.org/Phonology</ref>
