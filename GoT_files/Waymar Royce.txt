Ser '''Waymar Royce''' was a sworn brother of the [[Night's Watch]] who was killed by a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Ser Waymar Royce was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Royce]], an ancient and proud noble family of the [[Vale of Arryn]], and the youngest son of Lord [[Yohn Royce]], [[Lord of Runestone|Lord]] of [[Runestone]] and the head of the family. He joined the [[Night's Watch]] and was placed amongst the [[Ranger]]s due to his noble birth and skill at arms.{{Cite}}

[[File:Waymar_Royce,_Gared_&_Will.jpg|thumb|left|Rangers Gared, Ser Waymar Royce and Will depart Castle Black on a ranging beyond the Wall.]]
Ser Waymar Royce commands a ranging beyond the [[Wall]], accompanied by [[Gared]] and [[Will]], to investigate reports of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] in the [[Haunted Forest]] which lies [[beyond the Wall]]. Will, the best scout in the group, goes on a different path to scout.{{Ref|GOT101}}

When Will rejoins Ser Waymar and Gared, he tells them about wildling corpses dismembered and arranged in a strange, ritualistic fashion on the ground. Gared insists on returning to [[Castle Black]] to report the situation to the Night's Watch but Ser Waymar is unfazed. Instead, he commands the group to go to the site to determine what killed the wildlings. When they reach the site, the bodies have disappeared. Gared sends Will to find the bodies. While Will scouts around for clues, Ser Waymar is brutally slain by a [[White Walker (Winter Is Coming)|White Walker]] in front of terrified Gared.{{Ref|GOT101}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Jamie_as_Waymar.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jamie Campbell Bower]] as Waymar Royce in the unscreened [[Pilot (Game of Thrones)|pilot]].]]
In the unscreened [[Pilot (Game of Thrones)|pilot]] he was played by [[Jamie Campbell Bower]], but was recast with [[Rob Ostlere]] when the opening scene was re-shot.

He is the first character in the series to be killed.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Royce of [[Runestone]] is distantly related to [[House Stark]]. As is the third and youngest son of "Bronze" Yohn Royce, and therefore having little chance of inheriting lands or wealth, he joined the Night's Watch. Waymar was fast-tracked to being an officer because of his noble blood. Eighteen-year-old Waymar is a skilled warrior, trained by his castle's master-at-arms, but is untested in battle. He is arrogant and has a tendency to underrate the experience of other men due to their lower birth, even though they have been serving on the Wall for longer than he has, but he is not stupid. He realizes that if the Wall was "weeping" recently (partially melting), it could not be cold enough for eight wildlings with warm clothes, shelter, and material for a fire to simply freeze to death.

The young Sansa (who was less than 11 years old at the time) developed a massive romantic crush on the handsome young man in the brief time he and his father stayed at Winterfell before he departed to the Wall. He is described as grey-eyed, graceful, and slender as a knife.

Despite his youthful arrogance, when the White Walkers appear Waymar bravely challenges one to single combat, telling it to "dance with me then". [[Will]], hiding in a nearby tree, thinks to himself that "he was a boy no longer, but a man of the Night's Watch". Waymar's sword shatters after only a few clashes with the White Walker's [[crystal sword]] due to its extreme cold. One of the metal shards pierces his left eye, and he is defeated and killed. After waiting for some time Will hopes the White Walkers had left and climbs down: after examining Waymar's corpse, he retrieves the shattered sword-hilt to take it to Castle Black as evidence of what happened. When Will turns to rise again Waymar stood over him, now revived as a [[wight]], his remaining right eye glowing blue. The wight-Waymar then wraps its hands around Will's throat and strangles him to death. The TV version changes this so that Will, not [[Gared]], is the survivor of Waymar's party who escapes but and is beheaded by Ned Stark for desertion: Waymar is never shown being revived as a wight, and instead Gared is beheaded by another White Walker.
