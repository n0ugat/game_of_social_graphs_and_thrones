'''Crofters Village'''<ref>https://entertainment.ha.com/itm/movie-tv-memorabilia/props/jon-snow-kit-harington-command-map-of-winterfell-from-game-of-thrones-hbo-r-ori/a/7366-89521.s</ref> is a village in the [[North]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the crofters' village is inhabited by crofters. During [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s march on [[Winterfell]], the village is the site of multiple ritual burnings; once of the already-dead Bryen Farring, and later as an [[execution]] of four [[House Peasebury|Peasebury]] soldiers caught eating human flesh.
