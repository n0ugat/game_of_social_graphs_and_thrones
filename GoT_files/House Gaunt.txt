'''House Gaunt'''{{Ref|GOT806}} is a vassal house from the [[Crownlands]]. It directly holds fealty to the elected monarchs of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]].

==Members==
* Lord [[Symon Gaunt]], the head of House Gaunt.
* Ser {[[Gwayne Gaunt]]}, a [[Knighthood|knight]] of the [[Kingsguard]] during the reign of [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. Killed by Ser {[[Symon Hollard]]} during the [[Defiance of Duskendale]]. Ser {[[Barristan Selmy]]} avenged his death.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, little is mentioned about House Gaunt other than their sigil and Ser Gwayne's death.

Incidentally, George R.R. Martin has said that the narrative of the novel series is ''loosely'' inspired by the real-life War of the Roses, a succession war in England during the late fifteenth century. Much of the war centered around who was the rightful heir to King Edward III: "John of Gaunt" was Edward III's third son, and his descendants were the House of Lancaster (which produced kings Henry IV, Henry V, and Henry VI). John of Gaunt was so-called because he was born in the city of Ghent in Flanders, and at the time "Ghent" was rendered into English spelling as "Gaunt."
