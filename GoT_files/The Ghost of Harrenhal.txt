==Synopsis==
=== In the Stormlands ===
[[File:RenlysDeathS2Ep5.png|thumb|King Renly is assassinated.]]
King [[Renly Baratheon]] is assassinated by the [[Shadow]] brought into the world by [[Melisandre]] and fathered by [[Stannis Baratheon]] just after agreeing to an alliance with King [[Robb Stark]]. His [[kingsguard]] [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] is mistakenly blamed for the death and she flees the camp with [[Catelyn Stark]]. Brienne later swears fealty to Catelyn. Renly's army disintegrates, with the forces of [[House Tyrell]] fleeing to [[Highgarden]] and the rest of his bannermen joining his brother King Stannis. Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] accompanies the Tyrell faction, sensing an opportunity to sway them to Joffrey's side. Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] challenges King Stannis on his use of Melisandre's [[magic]] and convinces him to leave Melisandre behind when they attack [[King's Landing]] to quash rumors of her influence on him. Stannis places Davos in command of his fleet. When he is alone in his tent, Stannis briefly fights against tears, showing he does in fact grieve for his younger brother.

=== In King's Landing ===
[[Hand of the King]] [[Tyrion Lannister]] brings news of Renly's death to his sister, Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]]. She is pleased, but Tyrion predicts Stannis's imminent attack. He tries to discuss plans for their defense, but she insists on keeping them secret. From his spy, his cousin Ser [[Lancel Lannister]], Tyrion learns that Cersei has been having extensive meetings with the [[Alchemists' Guild]]. 
[[File:Wildfire.png|thumb|Tyrion discovers the [[Wildfire]].]]
He visits Wisdom [[Hallyne]] of the guild and learns that they have stockpiled thousands of jars of [[Wildfire]], a dangerously flammable substance, to use as catapult ammunition. [[Bronn]] warns that this strategy could be disastrous, and result in panicking defenders accidentally burning down their own city. Tyrion orders Hallyne to answer to him instead of Cersei. Tyrion also passes a street protest that blames him for the ills of the city, as they believe Tyrion to be manipulating [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].

=== At Lordsport ===
[[File:Theon and Dagmer 205.jpg|thumb|270x270px|Theon and Dagmer prepare to invade the North.]]
[[Theon Greyjoy]] takes command of his new ship and finds his crew insubordinate. His first mate [[Dagmer]] tells him that he needs to prove himself to the men and Theon plans to raid [[Torrhen's Square]] to draw the remaining forces of [[House Stark]] from [[Winterfell]]. His plan is successful and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] leads a force of 200 men to relieve his siege of Torrhen's Square.

=== At Winterfell ===
[[Bran Stark]] provides well judged counsel to his subjects but continues to be troubled by his dreams. He discusses dreaming of a [[Brynden Rivers|Three-Eyed Raven]] with the wildling woman [[Osha]] but she declines to interpret the dream. He also confides dreaming of the sea flooding Winterfell and drowning his people, including Ser Rodrik.

=== At Harrenhal ===
[[Tywin Lannister]] hosts a protracted war council to determine a new strategy to deal with Robb. [[Arya Stark]] serves as his [[cupbearer]]. Though he does not know who she really is, Tywin realizes that she is of northern extraction and questions her about her origins and opinions regarding Robb. She manages to avoid revealing her true identity. She leaves to fetch water and encounters [[Jaqen H'ghar]], now a Lannister man-at-arms. Jaqen says that because she saved his life, and those of his two fellow prisoners, he owes her three deaths and offers to kill three people of her choosing. She targets the [[Tickler]], Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]'s torturer.

The Tickler is soon found dead in the courtyard, his neck twisted 180 degrees. Arya notices Jaqen on the walkway above and he holds a single finger to his face to signify his responsibility.

=== At the Fist of the First Men ===
[[File:Ghost on a hill.jpg|thumb|The Night's Watch and Ghost on the Fist of the First Men.]]
[[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] leads his ranging to the ancient [[Fist of the First Men]] to rendezvous with the experienced scout [[Qhorin]]. Qhorin arrives and warns Jeor that they must change their tactics to combat the wildling army under [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] [[Mance Rayder]]. He suggests sending a small party ahead to neutralize Mance's lookouts in the [[Skirling Pass]]. [[Jon Snow]] joins Qhorin's group, while [[Samwell Tarly]] takes his task as the steward of the Lord Commander.

=== In Qarth ===
[[File:Drogon_breathes_fire.jpg|thumb|Drogon, breathing fire for the first time.]]
[[Daenerys Targaryen]] has taught her [[dragon]]s to breathe fire on command and they are now capable of sharing and eating meat on their own. She is enjoying the hospitality of the wealthy noble [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] in the city of [[Qarth]]. He hosts a gathering in her honor in the gardens of his home. She is perturbed by the tricks of the warlock [[Pyat Pree]], who invites her to visit the [[House of the Undying]].

The masked woman [[Quaithe]] delivers an enigmatic warning to Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] about Daenerys's need for protection from those who lust after her dragons. Xaro offers to fund Daenerys's invasion of [[Westeros]] in exchange for her hand in marriage. Later, she seeks Jorah's advice about the proposal and he cautions against accepting financial aid. He suggests that she will be able to win her throne should she reach Westeros with just a single ship. He reveals his depth of feeling for her but she does not return his affections.

==Quotes==
'''[[Catelyn Stark]]''': "Our [[House Stark|two]] [[House Baratheon|houses]] have always been close, which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle. Negotiate a peace with your brother."<br />
'''[[Renly Baratheon]]''': "Negotiate with Stannis? You heard him out there. I'd have better luck debating the wind. Please bring my terms to your son. I believe we are natural allies. I hope he feels the same. Together we could end this war in a fortnight."<br />
''[These turn out to be Renly's last words as the Shadow creature creeps into his tent and kills him in front of Catelyn and Brienne of Tarth.]''<br />

'''[[Petyr Baelish]]''': "Tell me, Ser Loras, what do you desire most in this world?"<br />
'''[[Loras Tyrell]]''': "Revenge."<br />
'''Petyr''': "I have always found that to be the purest of motivations, but you won't have a chance to put your sword through Stannis, not today. You'll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground. If it is justice that you want, be smart about it."<br />

'''[[Margaery Tyrell]]''': "Calling yourself king doesn't make you one. And if Renly wasn't a king, I wasn't a queen."<br />
'''Petyr''': "Do you want to be a queen?"<br />
'''Margaery''': "No. I want to be <u>the</u> Queen."<br />

'''[[Tywin Lannister]]''': "We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help."

'''Tywin''': "And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?"<br />
'''[[Arya Stark]]''': "They call him the young wolf."<br />
'''Tywin''': "And?"<br />
'''Arya''': "They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed."<br />
'''Tywin''': "And do you believe them?"<br />
'''Arya''': "No, My Lord. Anyone can be killed."<br />

'''[[Protestor]]''': "Corruption! Yes, we are swollen, bloated, foul! [[Jaime Lannister|Brother]] fornicates with [[Cersei Lannister|sister]] in the bed of [[king]]s, and we're surprised when the [[Joffrey Baratheon|fruit]] of their [[incest]] is rotten?! Yes, a rotten king!"<br />
'''[[Tyrion Lannister]]''': "It's hard to argue with his assessment."<br />

==Behind the scenes==
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#Arya's theme|Arya's theme]]. It did not appear on the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2 (Music from the HBO Series)|official soundtrack release]].
*In the novel "''A Clash of Kings''", the series of murders at [[Harrenhal]] perpetrated by [[Jaqen H'ghar]] are attributed to a ghost. The episode features the murder of the [[Tickler]] by Jaqen at [[Arya Stark]]'s request.
**In the book, Arya self-encouragingly calls herself "the ghost in Harrenhal".
*This episode marks the death of King Renly Baratheon.
**The night this episode aired, actor [[Finn Jones]] (who plays Renly's lover, Ser Loras Tyrell) posted to his Twitter account, ''"When the sun has set, no candle can replace it."''<ref>[https://twitter.com/#!/FinnJones/status/196771591500201984 Finn Jones' Twitter account], April 29th, 2012.</ref> This is actually a famous quote that Loras uses later in the book series.
**Renly's death reduces the number of factions in the war to four: Joffrey Baratheon, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy, and Stannis Baratheon. Of course, due to geography if not ideology, Stannis isn't actively fighting Robb, because they're on opposite sides of the Lannisters' position in the middle of the continent.
**This only includes the factions that are currently fighting each other in open warfare. House Tyrell, House Martell, and House Arryn are still active players in the ongoing political machinations of Westeros, e.g. Margaery Tyrell in this episode.
*For the first time since she left [[Pentos]], Daenerys is brought up to speed on the current political situation in Westeros, including the death of [[Robert Baratheon]], and the fact that four rival kings now vie for the throne (word of Renly's death evidently not having reached across the Narrow Sea yet).
*Daenerys says "Dracarys" to [[Drogon]], the young [[dragon]], to encourage him to breathe fire. Dracarys (pronounced "drah-KAH-ris") is the [[High Valyrian]] word for dragonfire.
*When Renly is meeting with Catelyn Stark, he says that the oath of fealty he wants Robb to swear will be the same one that Eddard Stark swore to Robert Baratheon "eighteen years ago". In Season 1, the events of [[Robert's Rebellion]] were consistently said to have occurred seventeen years ago. This reflects the passage of time by Season 2.
*Bronn refers to what Joffrey did to the "birthday present" that Tyrion sent him (which occurred in the [[Garden of Bones (episode)|preceding episode]]). In the culture of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], people actually use the term "[[nameday]]", not "birthday", because babies are named on the day they are born. "Nameday" has been consistently used on-screen throughout Season 1 and Season 2. This may have just been a dialogue error by the actor.
*Wisdom [[Hallyne]], the head of the [[Alchemists' Guild]], is played by [[Roy Dotrice]], who narrated the audiobook versions of all five novels currently in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series (and thus in a sense is "reprising" his role as Hallyne). Roy Dotrice was originally supposed to play the role of Grand Maester Pycelle, but fell ill shortly before production on the TV series began and had to decline. His health later recovered, however, allowing him to join the cast as Hallyne.
*This is the only episode in which [[House Tallhart]] is mentioned (by Dagmer).
*This is the second and last time in the show (following "[[The Night Lands]]") that the ironborn are referred to as "iron islanders". This phrase is never used in the books.
*It is the first time that Daenerys is referred to as "First of Her Name".
**According to the novels and ''"Blood & Fire"'', there were two more Targaryen princesses called Daenerys: the first was the secondborn child of King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]] and Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]], who died in the age of seven as a result of a deadly plague known as "Shivers"; the second was the [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|daughter of King Aegon IV]]. Since both never ruled as queens, Daenerys Stormborn is not the "Third of Her Name" but the first.

==In the books==
{{Main|Differences in adaptation/Game of Thrones: Season 2#"The Ghost of Harrenhal"}}
