{{Quote|As for Ser Denys's foreign wife, who had urged his defiance, Aerys commanded that her tongue and womanly parts be torn out, and she be burned alive.|[[Varys]]|The Defiance of Duskendale}}
Lady '''Serala'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was the wife of Lord [[Denys Darklyn]].

==Biography==
After the six-months-long [[Defiance of Duskendale]], Serala was mutilated and burned alive on [[Aerys II Targaryen|King Aerys]]'s orders.{{Ref|H&L805}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the [[smallfolk]] of [[Duskendale]] blame Serala for the fall of [[House Darklyn]], claiming she put the seed of rebellion in her husband's ear with [[Myr]]ish [[poison]] - though the truth of the matter is unknown. She was known as "the Lace Serpent", as fine lace is a major export from Myr.

Half the population of Duskendale believe that the Mad King was too kind to her.

In ''A Feast for Crows'', [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] arrives at Duskendale, searching for [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. An unnamed maester tells her the history of House Darklyn, particularly about Serala.
