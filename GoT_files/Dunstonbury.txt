'''Dunstonbury'''{{Ref|THTDB201}} is a castle in the [[Reach]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Dunstonbury was the ancestral seat of [[House Manderly]]. When the Manderlys were [[exile]]d to the [[North]], the castle was given to their rivals, [[House Peake]]. The Peakes were stripped of Dunstonbury for siding with the [[Daemon Blackfyre|Black Dragon]] in the [[Blackfyre Rebellion|First Blackfyre Rebellion]]. Its current rulers are unknown.

The New Castle in [[White Harbor]] resembles Dunstonbury.
