==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Gerion's genealogy and relation to the other Lannisters are the same. 

Gerion has never been married. He has one bastard daughter, Joy Hill.

Of all his uncles, Tyrion liked Gerion the best, and used to call him "uncle Gery".

Gerion had a stormy relationship with his elder brother Tywin, who overshadowed all of his siblings, but he was kind to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], gifting him books and teaching him tricks. 

Gerion once gave Tyrion [[Lomas Longstrider]]'s books ''Wonders'' and ''[[Wonders Made by Man]]'' as gifts. Tyrion was so fascinated by the books that Gerion liked to set him on the table during feasts and make him recite the wonders.

When [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] married, Gerion gave him a gilded dagger with an ivory grip and a sapphire pommel as a wedding gift.

About seven years before the beginning point of the series, Gerion went on a quest to track down House Lannister's ancestral [[Valyrian steel]] sword [[Brightroar]]; Tyrion, who was eighteen years old then, wanted to join him, but Tywin dubbed the voyage a "fool's quest," and forbade him to take part. Gerion never returned; Tywin sent men to look for him and they traced him as far as Volantis, where half his crew had deserted him because of his intent to sail into the [[Smoking Sea]]. Gerion's fate is still unknown.
