{{Quote|Basilisk blood. It will give cooked meat a savory smell. But, if eaten, it produces violent madness... in beasts as well as men. A mouse will attack a lion after a taste of basilisk blood. But to a man who knows his heart, is not passion a form of madness?|[[Oberyn Martell]]|Poisons}}
'''Basilisk blood'''{{Ref|H&L404}} is a [[poison]]. It gives cooked meat a savory smell, and induces a savage insanity in humans and animals.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the poison is a paste spiced with [[basilisk]] blood to produce basilisk venom, which gives meat a savory scent but which causes a violent madness in any creature with warm blood, whether man or beast.

The [[Waif]] tells [[Arya Stark|Arya]] that a mouse will attack a lion after a taste of basilisk blood.
