'''Daniel Brett "Dan" Weiss''' is an American Emmy winning novelist and scriptwriter. His debut novel ''[[wikipedia:Lucky Wander Boy|Lucky Wander Boy]]'' attracted favorable reviews on its release in 2002. He has written a number of unproduced film screenplays, including adaptations of the ''[[wikipedia:Halo (computer game)|Halo]]'' computer game series and of the novel ''[[wikipedia:Ender's Game|Ender's Game]]''. He is also working on the ''[[wikipedia: I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' prequel movie. He is a long-time friend and occasional collaborator of [[David Benioff]].

Benioff asked Weiss to develop the ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' project with him for HBO. On 16 January 2007, [[HBO]] optioned the rights to the books and the two writers began developing the project as a pilot script. The two writers appeared with [[George R.R. Martin]] at an appearance on social networking site ''[[wikipedia:Second Life|Second Life]]'' on 31 May 2007 to discuss the project with fans. On 9 September 2008, HBO exercised their option to buy the rights and ordered a pilot on 11 November, with Benioff and Weiss appointed as executive producers and showrunners of the project.

On ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' Weiss works as executive producer, showrunner, and scriptwriter. Together with David Benioff he has written most of the episodes of the series to date. Starting with the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]], he has co-directed episodes with Benioff.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Season_3_Directors/ Westeros.org]</ref>

Benioff and Weiss won the Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series 2015 Emmy Award for the Season 5 finale, "[[Mother's Mercy]]".<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-of-thrones-breaks-the-record-for-most-emmy-wins-in-a-year/ ]</ref>

Speaking with ''Variety'' in April 2016, Weiss said that his favorite characters are [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Samwell Tarly]]. When asked which character is the most difficult for him to write, Weiss said it was also Tyrion - because he is supposed to be very witty and intelligent, his lines always require more work, because Benioff and Weiss admit they aren't as extremely witty in real life as Tyrion is supposed to be all the time within the story.<ref>[http://variety.com/video/game-of-thrones-who-is-winning-killed-off/ ]</ref>
