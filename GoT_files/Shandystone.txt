'''Shandystone'''{{Ref|THTDB201}} is a holdfast in southeastern [[Dorne]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Shandystone is a modest ruin with fluted pillars, triple arches, and a dry well. The mosaics and statues inside the holdfast have been overtaken and scoured away by the sands. It was abandoned when its well went dry, around 200 AC.

Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] once brought his daughters [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]] and [[Sarella Sand]] and his niece Arianne Martell to Shandystone. Arianne later returns there to gather her co-conspirators to crown Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]] as queen of the [[Seven Kingdoms]].
