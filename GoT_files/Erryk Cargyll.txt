{{Quote|Something must be done. Aegon is unfit to rule.|Erryk to Arryk|The Green Council}}
Ser '''Erryk Cargyll''' was a renowned [[Knighthood|knight]], and member of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Queensguard]] of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen]] [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], as well as the twin of Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]], a member of the opposing Kingsguard of King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]. He formerly served in the Kingsguard of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]], as the sworn shield of Aegon II before his accession to the throne.

==Biography==
===Background===
At the age of 18,{{Ref|HOTD201}} Erryk and his twin brother Arryk were both appointed members of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] to King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]. After the birth of Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], he was named the prince's sworn protector, allowing him a full view of Aegon's perverse hedonism.

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Erryk and his brother Arryk attend the funeral of [[Aemma Arryn]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Erryk approaches Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] after a meeting of the [[Small Council]] to inform her of an incident with the servant girl [[Dyana]] in Prince Aegon's chambers. She briefly mistakes him for his brother, to which he duly corrects her. He and Arryk practice their swordsmanship against one another in the courtyard of the Red Keep as the Princes [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon]] recall their memories of training in the Keep from years past. He is present in the throne room as [[Vaemond Velaryon]] petitions to have himself named the heir to Driftmark, announcing the arrival of King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] and later standing against [[Daemon Targaryen]] after he executes Vaemond for his words of outrage.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[File:TGC Arryk and Erryk Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Erryk searches Flea Bottom with Arryk.]]
During the [[Greens]]' [[coup in King's Landing]], Erryk is given the task of finding the disappeared Prince Aegon by [[Otto Hightower]], and travels to [[Flea Bottom]] alongside Arryk. The pair search the streets, eventually reaching an underground child fighting ring that Aegon frequents. He and Arryk argue about whether Aegon is fit to rule, and Erryk points out one of the prince's silver-haired bastards to concede his dissatisfaction. They are approached by an agent of the [[Mysaria|White Worm]], who offers the prince's location in exchange for a meeting with Otto.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Erryk accompanies Otto to the meeting and sits at his side while he comes to an agreement with Mysaria. She informs them of Aegon's hiding place within the [[Grand Sept]]. Unbeknownst to any in the meeting, they are observed by Ser [[Criston Cole]] and Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]], who are independently searching for Aegon on the order of Queen Alicent. Erryk and Arryk travel to the Grand Sept, and find Aegon beneath an altar. They depart to bring Aegon to Otto outside the walls of the city but are intercepted by Cole and Aemond. A fight breaks out, Arryk dueling against Criston as Aemond pursues the fleeing Aegon. During the fight, Erryk stands aside at the top of the steps of the Sept, fully disillusioned by the Greens from this display of infighting. He takes his leave as Cole disarms Arryk and Aemond subdues Aegon.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Erryk and Rhaenys Still 2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Erryk frees the captive Princess Rhaenys.]]
Erryk steals the crown of King Viserys I and breaks into the chambers of the imprisoned Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]], with the intent to spirit her out of the city and take her to [[Dragonstone]]. He attempts to bring her to his prepared horses, but she insists on retrieving her dragon [[Meleys]]. As they flee, crowds of smallfolk being corralled by the City Watch toward the [[Dragonpit]] for the coronation of Aegon block their way and separate them. Erryk loses sight of Rhaenys in the hordes of people, fleeing the city as she retrieves her dragon and escapes independently.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TBQ Erryk Cargyll Still.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Erryk bequeaths Viserys's crown to Rhaenyra.]]
Erryk travels alone to Dragonstone, where the [[Blacks]] have congregated. He approaches [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] in the courtyard as she mourns the loss of her stillborn daughter [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]], and offers the crown of her father to her husband [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] to place upon her head. He recites the oath of the Kingsguard in the name of Rhaenyra and is accepted into the ranks of her Queensguard.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

During a war meeting of the [[Black Council]], he enters to announce the arrival of a ship bearing the royal standard of Aegon II. He, along with fellow Queensguard members [[Steffon Darklyn]] and [[Lorent Marbrand]], accompany Daemon during a confrontation with Otto to discuss a potential compromise between the factions. Tensions grow and blades are drawn as the Blacks reject the terms of the Greens, and in the ensuing stand-off Erryk and Arryk meet each other's gaze. An angered Daemon demands that Erryk bring Otto forth to be castrated for his treachery against the named succession, but Rhaenyra's intervention stays any bloodshed. Upon the resummation of the meeting, he stands vigil at the Painted Table as Rhaenyra discusses ensuring the loyalty of the [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|Starks]], [[House Arryn/House of the Dragon|Arryns]], and [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|Baratheons]] to her cause. During the meeting Prince Jacaerys offers himself and Lucerys to be envoys to the Starks and Baratheons, respectively, so the Queen has Erryk retrieve and present ''[[The Seven-Pointed Star]]'' for the brothers to swear upon to not act in violence as guests.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Erryk sails aboard a ship of the [[Velaryon fleet]] blockading the Gullet. When his ship intercepts a vessel trying to cross [[Blackwater Bay]], Erryk leads a boarding party and finds [[Mysaria]] hiding in the cargo hold as a stowaway. He takes her back to [[Dragonstone]] as a prisoner and is a witness to her subsequent interrogation by Prince Daemon. Erryk tries to speak up in Mysaria's defense, corroborating the truth of her claims to Daemon, who furiously asks why Erryk cares. When Erryk calls it a matter of honor, Daemon rounds on him, asking if honor led him and his "[[Arryk Cargyll|traitorous twin]]" to stand aside and let the Greens [[Coup in King's Landing|usurp the throne]]. Erryk argues that honor compelled him to abandon the Greens and side with Rhaenyra, but an unappeased Daemon notes that Erryk had [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] in his grasp so many times (both as the prince's sworn shield and when he and Arryk recovered Aegon from Mysaria's hiding place in the [[Grand Sept]]) and demands to know why Erryk didn't kill Aegon when he had the chance. Erryk replies that the vows of the Kingsguard didn't include what to do when the royal family turned on each other. Before Daemon can say more, a roar from [[Syrax]] outside the castle alerts both men to [[Rhaenyra]]'s return from [[Shipbreaker Bay]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Erryk attends a subsequent meeting of the Black Council and witnesses his queen's command that [[Aemond Targaryen]] die in retaliation for his murder of her son, [[Lucerys]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}
[[File:2x2 Erryk and Arryk Still 1.jpg|thumb|Brothers face off against each other.]]
Erryk accompanies his Queen to Mysaria's cell, and witnesses Rhaenyra agree to honor her husband's promise to free Mysaria in return for information. Rhaenyra instructs Erryk to let Mysaria collect her things then have a guard escort her to the ''[[Corwyn]]'', a ship docked at Dragonstone that will take Mysaria to [[Myr]] by way of [[Pentos]]. Some time afterwards, Erryk is alerted to the fact his brother Arryk has infiltrated Dragonstone, disguised as him, to assassinate Rhaenyra; he races to the royal apartments to find Arryk threatening Rhaenyra with a drawn sword. Erryk begs Arryk not to go throw with his orders, but when Arryk tries to attack Rhaenyra, Erryk intervenes, and a savage duel between the pair ensues. The pair inflict brutal wounds on each other, the noise bringing Erryk's Sworn Brother, Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]] running, who gets Rhaenyra to safety but is unable to tell Erryk apart from Arryk to aid him. Ultimately, Erryk triumphs, running Arryk through with his sword. Broken with grief for what he just did and unable to live with the guilt of being a [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]], he begs Rhaenyra for forgiveness before falling on his sword, committing suicide.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

[[File:DeadArryandErryk-203.png|thumb|right|250px|The Cargyll brothers are laid to rest on Dragonstone.]]Erryk and Arryk are buried together on Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

==Personality==
Ser Erryk maintains a strong code of personal morals. He believes the ruler of Westeros should be of strong character and integrity, and is so disgusted that King Aegon is an irresponsible, depraved hedonist that he forsakes the sworn life oath of the Kingsguard to follow his personal code of honor. Erryk's personal honor led him to defend Mysara against Daemon and Rhaenyra against his brother Arryk.

He also shows animosity to more neutral positions, as he leaves his brother to fend for himself in a potentially deadly duel against Ser Criston after he insisted they were to follow orders and perform their duty, even if they know it isn't right to crown Aegon. 

He also shows a side of cunning when he both steals the crown of Viserys and frees Rhaenys under the cover of darkness, going unregarded by the rest of the Red Keep's various servants.

Despite ending up on opposite sides during the Dance of the Dragons, Erryk deeply loved his twin Arryk, so much so that the pain of killing him to defend Rhaenyra led him to take his own life.

==Behind the scenes==
During a [[Black Council]] scene in "[[The Black Queen]]," Erryk was briefly played by [[Luke Tittensor]], Elliott's brother who plays Arryk, as Elliott had contracted COVID-19 and was thus unavailable.<ref>[https://ew.com/tv/house-of-the-dragon-finale-twin-cargyll-actor-switch/ ''House of the Dragon'' had to swap twin Cargyll actors for finale after COVID scare | EW.com]</ref>

His character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"A former member of Viserys’ Kingsguard who left King’s Landing – and his twin brother – to swear fealty to Queen Rhaenyra and join her Queensguard."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Erryk Cargyll was also the twin brother of Ser Arryk, and both were knights of Viserys I's Kingsguard. [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] relate to their tragic death.{{Bookref|AGOT|8}}{{Bookref|ACOK|41}}

In 120 AC, King Viserys made Erryk the sworn shield of Rhaenyra, replacing Ser [[Harwin Strong]].

In 129 AC, following Viserys's death, Erryk followed Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]] and Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]] in siding with the [[blacks]] and joined the Queensguard of Rhaenyra. His twin, however, supported Aegon II.

It was not Erryk but Steffon Darklyn who stole the golden crown and delivered it to Rhaenyra.

[[Olenna Tyrell]]'s personal guards (whom Olenna humorously call Left and Right, since she cannot tell them apart) are named Erryk and Arryk, perhaps named after the legendary twin Kingsguards.{{Bookref|ASOS|6}}

According to [[George R.R. Martin]], the Cargyll twins have been inspired by the twin knights of Arthurian myth, {{WPS|Sir Balin}} and Sir Balan.<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/15619/ So Spake Martin, January 28, 1999]</ref>
