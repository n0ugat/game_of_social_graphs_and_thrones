{{Dialogue a-b|Brienne of Tarth|The kidney pie is wonderful.|Hot Pie|Thanks.  I do my best.  A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients.  Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk - easy enough.  But the meat?  Peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy.  I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys.  Got no right to cook anything, them.  Oh, and the ''gravy''!  Don't get me started on the gravy.  Very difficult to get right.  See, a lot of people give up on the gravy.  You ''cannot'' give up on the gravy.  No gravy, no pie - Simple as that.|[[Hot Pie]] extols on how to make a proper kidney pie|Mockingbird}}
