{{Quote|Illyrio and I grew so rich that Illyrio wed a princess of Pentos.|[[Varys]]|The Little Birds}}
'''Illyrio Mopatis's wife''' was a princess of [[Pentos]].

==Biography==
The princess married [[Illyrio Mopatis]] due to the wealth he had gained through robberies he had committed with his friend [[Varys]].{{Ref|H&L614}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Illyrio Mopatis's first wife was a cousin of the [[Prince of Pentos]] and the daughter of a [[Magister]]. She was willing to marry him after he gained a respectable position with the help of Varys. The marriage eventually ended (it is not specified whether she died or left Illyrio); Illyrio then married a former bedslave named Serra, for which the prince banished him from the palace.
