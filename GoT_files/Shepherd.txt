The '''Shepherd''' is a [[Smallfolk|common]] man who lived in [[King's Landing]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|TDOD}}

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' and ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the Shepherd was a follower of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. He was said to be a beggar and may have been one of the Poor Fellows, a group of outlawed and disbanded fanatics who continued to stubbornly haunt the realm.
