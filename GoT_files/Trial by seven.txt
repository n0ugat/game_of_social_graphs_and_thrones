{{Quote|Once in a long while, you may get two real highborn shits having a go at each other and one of them might be fool enough to demand a trial by seven. Exactly how it sounds: seven men against seven men.|[[Bronn]]|Justice of the Seven Kingdoms}}
A '''trial by seven'''{{Ref|H&L416}} is a variation of a [[trial by combat]]. Very rarely, after the accused has demanded a trial by combat, he may also demand a "trial by seven": instead of one man versus one man, two teams of seven men each will fight.

==Rules==
As with a normal trial by combat, the accused and accuser each have to pick six other champions - though each also has the option to not fight in person but to name a seventh man as their personal champion. A trial by seven ends only when all seven men on one side have been defeated (either by yielding or dying).

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the trial of seven is a form of trial by combat an offended party can demand during trial. It is linked to the [[Faith of the Seven]] and [[Andals|Andal]] tradition.

The Andals believed that if seven champions fought on each side, the gods thus honored would be more likely to see justice done. If a man cannot find six others to stand with him, then he is obviously guilty. There has not been a trial by seven in almost a hundred years.
