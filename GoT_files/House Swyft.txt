'''House Swyft'''{{Guideref|Viewer's Guide}} of [[Cornfield]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. Their seat is Cornfield, located north-east of [[Crakehall]] and south of [[Clegane's Keep]]. They are landed knights rather than a full noble house.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/cornfield/]</ref>

Their sigil is a blue bantam rooster on yellow. Their [[house words]] are "Awake! Awake!"

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Swyft is counted as a strong vassal and ally of House Lannister. However, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] considers Ser Harys to be a chinless craven and lickspittle of little worth; the other Lannisters also have a negative opinion about him. Dorna is described as "equally chinless" as her father.

House Swyft joined their Lannister lieges in siding with King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] during the Dance of the Dragons. At this time they were a full [[noble house]], but by the time the series begins they are a [[Noble house|knightly house]]. How the Swyfts lost their lordship is unknown.

** His eldest daughter, [[Dorna Lannister]]. Married to Ser [[Kevan Lannister]].
