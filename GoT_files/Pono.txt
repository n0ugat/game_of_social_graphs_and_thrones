'''Pono''' is a [[Dothraki]] ''[[khal]]''.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
After discovering the severed head of [[Rakharo]] inside a bag carried by Rakharo's horse, Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] considers either ''Khal'' Pono or [[Jhaqo]] as the culprits and that Rakharo was killed as a demonstration of contempt for the notion of a [[Daenerys Targaryen|woman]] leading a ''[[khalasar]]''.{{Ref|GOT202}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
All known great ''khal''s are burned alive by Daenerys at the ''[[Khalar Vezhven]]''. Pono's fate is unknown, since he is not mentioned to be among them.{{Ref|GOT604}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Pono is a ''ko'' in Khal [[Drogo]]'s khalasar. After Drogo's fall from his horse and subsequent incapacitation, Pono is one the first of several kos that declares himself khal, taking ten thousand of the khalasar as his own.

In ''A Dance With Dragons'', it is reported that Pono is near the headwaters of the Selhoru with a khalasar of thirty thousand, and that other khals fear of him.
