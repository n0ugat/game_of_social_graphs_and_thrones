'''Dragonstone''',{{Ref|H&L503}} or '''Valyrian stone''',{{Ref|GOT205}} is a construction material used in [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] architecture. It was made by turning stone to liquid with [[dragon]]flame and reshaping it. The castle of [[Dragonstone]] and the [[Black Walls]] of [[Volantis]] are made of dragonstone. Some [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] believe that the [[black stone]] fortress at the base of the [[Hightower]] is also made of dragonstone, but it is curiously plain and unadorned and predates the Valyrians by many thousands of years.{{Ref|H&L612}}
