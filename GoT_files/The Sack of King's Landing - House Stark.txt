==Narration==
'''Luwin''': ''[[Robert Baratheon]]'s [[Battle of the Trident|victory]] at the [[Trident]] was a turning point in the [[Robert's Rebellion|war]] for the [[Iron Throne]]. While it was clear the gods were smiling on the rebel forces, [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]] still held the [[Red Keep]] at [[King's Landing]]. As Robert was wounded and unable to ride, it was up to [[Eddard Stark]] to make for the capital and force the Mad King to give up the [[Iron Throne|throne]].''

''Lord Stark reached the city gates to find that [[Tywin Lannister]], [[Lord of Casterly Rock]], had already [[Sack of King's Landing|sacked]] the city in Robert's name. [[House Lannister]] had remained neutral up to this point, ignoring requests for help from both the crown and the rebels. Now that Robert's eventual victory was assured, it seemed Lord Tywin had finally chosen a side.''

''Lord Eddard was horrified by what he saw when he entered the city - homes looted and burned, women raped, scores of innocent citizens killed. Disgusted, he led his force up [[King's Landing|Visenya's Hill]] to the Red Keep. Upon entering the [[throne room]], he found King Aerys lying in a pool of blood... dead, by the hand of his own sworn [[Kingsguard]], [[Jaime Lannister]] - who sat brazenly upon the throne.''

''Demanding to know the whereabouts of Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]], Lord Eddard was informed the queen and her son [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] had been spirited away to [[Dragonstone]] before the Lannisters arrived. But other members of the royal family were not as fortunate. [[Elia Martell]] of [[Dorne]], who was the wife of Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], had been raped and murdered by Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] on Lord Tywin's orders. Ser Gregor and his men had also butchered Rhaegar's young children.''

''When Robert was well enough to reach the capital, Lord Eddard demanded the Lannisters answer for their heinous crimes. Robert refused, and sent himself to relieve the [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] stronghold of [[Storm's End]], which was still under [[Siege of Storm's End|siege]] by [[House Tyrell|forces loyal to the crown]]. Whatever words passed between the two old friends are known only to them, but Lord Eddard is said to have left King's Landing in anger.''

''Later, when Robert was crowned, he appointed [[Jon Arryn]] as [[Hand of the King]]. Lord Arryn's first order of business was to broker a truce with the [[House Martell|Martells]] of Dorne, who were outraged by the brutal murder of Princess Elia and her children.''

''Following the death of [[Lyanna Stark]], who had been betrothed to Robert, Houses Baratheon and Lannister were joined in marriage when the new king took Tywin Lannister's eldest daughter, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], as his queen.''

''As for Eddard Stark, he returned to his stronghold of [[Winterfell]], forever haunted by his sister's death, and the shameful way that Robert had secured his throne.''
