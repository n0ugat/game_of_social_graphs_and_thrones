{{Quote|It's my father's sword, and his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. It was meant for my son, Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House... but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros.|Lord Commander Jeor Mormont|Baelor}}
'''Longclaw'''{{Ref|GOT109}} is a [[Valyrian steel]] bastard sword that was the ancestral weapon of [[House Mormont]] for five centuries. When [[Lord of Bear Island|Lord]] [[Jeor Mormont]] retired from his [[lordship]] to take the black and [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|command]] the [[Night's Watch]], he passed it to his son and heir, [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Jorah Mormont]]. When Jorah went into [[exile]] after trying to sell some poachers into [[slavery]], he left the sword and Jeor's sister [[Maege Mormont|Maege]] returned it to him at the [[Wall]].

Years later, Jeor gave Longclaw to [[Jon Snow]] as a reward for saving his life from a [[wight]]. Before giving it to Jon he had the pommel remade, replacing the [[bear]] with a [[direwolf]], the [[Heraldry|sigil]] of [[House Stark]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Longclaw BearPommel.png|thumb|Longclaw with its original bear pommel.]]
Jeor gives the sword to Jon as a reward for saving his life from a [[Othor|wight]] (and also as a symbol of his growing fatherly affection for him). Before passing it on to Jon, he remarks that the name "Longclaw" is just as suitable for a wolf as a bear. Mormont has had the pommel remade, replacing the bear with a direwolf, the sigil of [[House Stark]]. He mentions that the sword previously belonged to his son, Jorah, who out of shame left Longclaw behind when he fled [[Westeros]]. Jon politely tries to refuse, but Mormont insists he keep it.

Jon takes the sword to the dining hall to get the Lord Commander's dinner. He is confronted by the other recruits. [[Pypar|Pyp]] and [[Grenn]] are especially vocal in demanding to see the sword.<ref>"[[Baelor]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Craster]] briefly takes Longclaw from Jon after the latter follows him into the woods to see what the man [[White Walkers|does with his infant sons]]. Jon is admonished harshly by Mormont for this, who returns the sword to him and instructs him not to lose it again.

Jon later takes Longclaw with him when he takes part in the [[great ranging]] [[beyond the Wall]] led by Mormont. Jon is sent with a scouting party led by [[Qhorin|Qhorin Halfhand]] which ambushes a group of [[Free Folk|wildlings]], during which Jon takes [[Ygritte]] captive. Qhorin leaves Jon to kill Ygritte with Longclaw, but Jon cannot bring himself to do that.<ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref>

Ygritte later lures Jon into a trap. He is captured by a group of wildlings led by the [[Lord of Bones]], who take Longclaw from him. Ygritte carries Longclaw as they head back to the main camp of [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] [[Mance Rayder]].<ref>"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"</ref>
[[File:Jon kills Qhorin.jpg|thumb|Qhorin's death.]]
As they are about to reach the camp, Ygritte playfully keeps lightly whacking Jon in the head with the flat side of the sword. He eventually dodges and slips behind her, noting that she doesn't know how to wield a sword very well. Qhorin, having also been captured, stages a fight with Jon to convince the wildlings that he is betraying his vows to [[Desertion|desert]] to them, so he can infiltrate Mance Rayder's camp. Qhorin steals a sword from a guard, so Ygritte tosses Longclaw back to Jon so he can defend himself. As Qhorin intended, Jon ends up killing him, impaling him on Longclaw. This marks the first time Jon has ever killed anyone. The wildlings are thus convinced that he wants to defect, and lead Jon into the camp.<ref>"[[Valar Morghulis]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The [[Lord of Bones]] continues to hold onto Longclaw as they lead Jon into the main wildling camp, and he waits outside with it as Jon enters Mance Rayder's tent.<ref>"[[Valar Dohaeris]]"</ref>

Jon uses Longclaw during the [[battle for the Wall]], killing several wildlings with the sword. In a duel with [[Styr]], the [[Thenns|Thenn]] manages to knock Longclaw out of Jon's hands, but Jon smashes a hammer into his skull and kills Styr. After the battle, Jon intends to find [[Mance Rayder]]. Remembering that Jeor told him never to lose the sword again, Jon gives Longclaw to [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] for safekeeping.<ref>"[[The Watchers on the Wall]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===

When the [[White Walkers]] [[Massacre at Hardhome|attack]] [[Hardhome]], Jon is able to defeat [[White Walker (Hardhome)|one]] in a duel using Longclaw. To the surprise of both Jon and White Walker, the Valyrian steel sword does not break after coming into contact with the White Walker's [[crystal sword]]. Pressing his advantage, Jon slashes the Walker with Longclaw; the creature shatters on contact, revealing that [[dragonglass]] is not the only thing that can kill a White Walker.<ref>"[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===

He is prevented from doing so by the timely arrival of wildling reinforcements.<ref>"[[Home]]"</ref> 

Longclaw is then used by Jon Snow to cut the rope which drops Thorne and the mutineers to their death by hanging.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref> A day later, [[Eddison Tollett|Dolorous Edd]] is seen giving the sword to Jon as he starts to pack up to leave [[Castle Black]].<ref>"[[Book of the Stranger]]"</ref>

When [[Ramsay Bolton]] makes one last defiant challenge for a one on one duel while choosing a bow and arrow for his weapon, Jon is forced to drop Longclaw in order to pick up a Mormont shield from the ground and block three arrows shot by Ramsay, until he reaches and beats Ramsay bloody with his bare hands.

However, Jorah refuses, stating that he lost the right to wield the sword and any claim to it when he brought shame onto his house and gives his blessing for Jon to keep it.

Later, Jon kills a [[White Walker 1 (Beyond the Wall)|White Walker]] with Longclaw, which allows him to discover that once a White Walker is destroyed, all the wights turned by this Walker are immediately destroyed as well. Jon continues to use Longclaw, destroying many wights during the ensuing battle against the army of the [[Night King]].<ref>"[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"</ref> After the battle ends, Jon uses the sword to haul himself out of the water, digging the hilt into the ice covering the lake he'd fallen into.
