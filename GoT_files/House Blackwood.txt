'''House Blackwood'''{{Guideref|Viewer's Guide}} of [[Raventree Hall]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. Their lands are in the heart of the [[Riverlands]], located along the banks of the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]]. House Blackwood's sigil is a flock of ravens on scarlet surrounding a dead weirwood tree.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Brakens-and-Blackwoods.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Houses Bracken and Blackwood share a long-standing and mutual animosity.]]
House Blackwood were once lesser kings during the [[Age of Heroes]]. The Blackwoods hold an ancient grudge against their neighbors, [[House Bracken]] of [[Stone Hedge]]. The two houses, which hold the blood of the [[First Men]] in their veins and merged with the invading [[Andals]] rather than being annihilated by them, competed for the throne of the Riverlands when it was an independent kingdom. The enmity was increased when House Bracken converted to the [[Faith of the Seven]]. House Blackwood, however, is one of the few major noble Houses outside of the North which continues to worship the [[Old Gods]], and never converted to the Faith of The Seven.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/raventree-hall/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Raventree Hall entry]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Blackwood is a loyal vassal of the Tullys. The enmity and competition between [[House Bracken]] and House Blackwood was radically enhanced when Ser Otho Bracken slew Lord Quentyn Blackwood in a tourney accident roughly a century ago, and it still exists at present - even when the two houses were temporarily on the same side during the [[War of the Five Kings]].

Following the Red Wedding, the Blackwoods - alongside the Mallisters and the Tullys at Riverrun - are the few Riverlords who refuse to yield to the Iron Throne- the Brackens were among the first.{{Bookref|ASOS|53}} After Lord [[Jason Mallister]] and the Tullys surrender, Raventree Hall is the last stronghold in the Riverlands which is still unconquered.

In the fifth novel, after resolving the [[Second siege of Riverrun|siege of Riverrun]], Jaime travels to Raventree Hall and persuades Lord Tytos Blackwood, non-violently, to yield. Lord Bracken spitefully suggests that Jaime be punitive in his dealing with the Blackwoods, but the latter develops a moderate liking for Lord Blackwood- and deals kindly with him, while also subtly punishing Lord Bracken (as a former rebellious lord).{{Bookref|ADWD|48}}

The Blackwoods were originally from the [[North]], and ruled most of the [[wolfswood]] before being driven out by the [[House Stark|Stark]] [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]]. 500-1000 years before the [[coming of the Andals]], the feud between the Blackwoods and Brackens began. Nonetheless, the two houses allied against the [[Andals]] and were defeated in the Battle of the Bitter River. The feud was then made even more bitter when the Brackens converted to the Andal [[Faith of the Seven|new gods]] while the Blackwoods kept to the [[Old Gods|old gods]].

The sigil of House Blackwood is slightly different in the books, in which the white weirwood tree is set against a black escutcheon (shield), which is itself surrounded by a red background containing black ravens. The TV series version removed the black shield, so the white weirwood tree is directly against the red background.
