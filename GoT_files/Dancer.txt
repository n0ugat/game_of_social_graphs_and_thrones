'''Dancer'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the horse of [[Bran Stark]]. She is specially trained to allow Bran to ride despite being unable to move his legs.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
With the mechanism proposed by [[Tyrion Lannister]], Bran is able to ride through the woods on Dancer. However, they are soon ambushed by [[Osha]], [[Stiv]] and [[Wallen]] before being rescued by [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Dancer is a two year old filly with a chestnut coat. She is trained by Joseth, the horsemaster of [[Winterfell]] especially for Bran. She presumably perishes during the [[Sack of Winterfell]].
