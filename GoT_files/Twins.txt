{{Quote|The Freys have held the Crossing for six hundred years, and for six hundred years they've never failed to exact their toll.|[[Catelyn Stark]]|Baelor}}
The '''Twins''',{{Ref|GOT108}} sometimes known as the '''Crossing''',{{Ref|GOT109}} is a castle and the seat of [[House Frey]], the former Great House of the Riverlands. It consists of two near-identical towers and a fortified bridge over the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]].

The Twins represents the only crossing point over the Green Fork for hundreds of miles in either direction. It is a major barrier to travelers and merchants traveling from the [[North]] to the western [[Riverlands]]. It lies directly on the main route from [[Winterfell]] to [[Riverrun]]. Moving from one castle to the other while avoiding the Twins requires a lengthy detour hundreds of miles to the south or hazardously traversing the bogs and swamps of the [[Neck]] to the north. Travelers heading south who cannot pass southwest over the Twins must pass southeast along the [[Kingsroad]].<ref name=":0">"[[Baelor]]"</ref>

The Freys' rise began six hundred years before the events of the series with the building of a stone bridge over the Green Fork. It took three generations to build the Twins, but afterwards they quickly grew wealthy by charging passing travelers for the use of the Crossing. The bridge is a massive arch of smooth grey stone, wide enough for two wagons to pass abreast.<ref>"[[House Frey (short)|House Frey]]"</ref>

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Prince [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] travels to the Twins atop his dragon [[Vermax]] to negotiate with Lord [[Forrest Frey|Forrest]] and Lady [[Serena Frey]] for House Frey's allegiance to the [[Blacks]] and for the northern troops despatched by [[Cregan Stark]] to use the Crossing. Forrest and Serena agree to support Rhaenyra in return for assurances Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Caraxes]] will defend the Twins against any Green counterattack, and that [[Harrenhal]] be granted to the Freys at war's end.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Soldiers under the banner of [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|House Stark]] use the Twins to cross into the Riverlands to support the Black war effort.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:The-bridge-twins-1.9.PNG|thumb|The Stark army at the Twins.]]
[[Robb Stark]] needs to cross the river at the Twins to face [[Tywin Lannister]]'s forces in battle, but [[Catelyn Stark|his mother]] warns him that Lord Walder Frey is proud, prickly and unreliable. She negotiates on Robb's behalf and wins an alliance: in return for allowing Robb's forces to cross and for the allegiance of House Frey, Robb and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] must marry some of House Frey's offspring. Robb must also take [[Olyvar Frey]] as his squire, a knighthood being expected in due course. Robb accepts the deal. His army crosses the river and splits into two forces, a diversionary force to face Tywin and a larger force to ride hard and attack [[Jaime Lannister]]'s forces north of [[Riverrun]].<ref name=":0" />

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The Twins are referenced in conversation between Robb Stark and his eventual bride [[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]] on the topic of Robb's promised betrothal to any Frey girl of his choosing - upon asked why, Robb declares that The Twins is "a very important bridge".<ref name=":0" />

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[File:Red wedding s3 ep9.png|thumb|House Frey at the Twins during the Red Wedding.]]
After the funeral of [[Hoster Tully|his grandfather]], [[Robb Stark]] comes to conclusion that drastic action must be taken to force the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] to surrender, by taking [[Casterly Rock]]. This plan is hindered by the murder of two Lannister children, [[Martyn Lannister|Martyn]] and [[Willem Lannister|Willem]], who were Robb's prisoners, by his bannerman [[Rickard Karstark]] - causing Robb to take Rickard's head as justice for defying his orders.

This action leaves Robb without the support of [[House Karstark]] and a large portion of his army, so he seeks to redeem his favor with [[House Frey]] and [[Walder Frey]] by marrying his [[Edmure Tully|uncle]] to a Frey girl. As Robb had defied the oath he had took to marry a Frey girl himself, he was on bad terms with the Twins, but all seems to be forgiven.
The events that follow became known as the [[Red Wedding]], and reveal the treacherous intentions of [[House Bolton]] and [[Roose Bolton]], as well as the wrath of Lord Walder Frey as he orders an ambush attack after the bedding ceremony, resulting in the demise of Robb Stark, his wife [[Talisa Stark]] and his mother Catelyn Stark, the imprisonment of Edmure Tully and the massacre of some of Robb's bannermen and a large amount of Northern soldiers in the camps outside the Twins.<ref name=":0" />

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
After [[Jaime Lannister]] takes back [[Riverrun]] from the [[Brynden Tully|Blackfish]], he arrives at the Twins, where [[Walder Frey|Lord Walder]] congratulates him on his victory and goes so far as to compare himself to Jaime, stating that they are both Kingslayers. This irritates Jaime, who informs Walder that the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] would not help him if he failed to keep order in the [[Riverlands]]. Later, as Walder is eating, he is assassinated by [[Arya Stark]], who kills him in revenge for her [[Robb Stark|brother]]'s and [[Catelyn Stark|mother]]'s deaths at the [[Red Wedding]] .

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Disguised as Walder, Arya assassinates the remaining male members of House Frey, avenging all the Stark forces slaughtered at the Red Wedding, by poisoning wine given to them. She gives a message to Walder's wife [[Kitty Frey]] that "Winter came for House Frey", before leaving the Twins.

==Behind the scenes==
Production Designer [[Gemma Jackson]] explained the visual aesthetic of the Twins, and the underlying reasoning behind it:

:"In Season 1, we built a grubby little space. It was really old and painted and water was coming down - it was rather sinister. We wanted to get an aspect of that again. Because Lord Walder is mean, we did this beaten up, old leather [for the furniture]. We used his sigil on the arches - you can see very old bits of paint just coming through. The idea is the place is getting incredibly shabby, and he doesn't want to spend any money on it."<ref>"[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]", HBO-Go Inside-the-Episode feature</ref>

The Freys actually are a wealthy family - but they gained their wealth relatively recently, starting six hundred years ago when they built the first bridge across the river and began exacting river tolls. The older noble Houses of the Riverlands look down on them as upstarts. Lord Walder became rich by being miserly, however. He has no sense of shame, so he'd rather have a leaky roof in need of repair and worn down furniture, than spend any money on replacing them, regardless of the public appearance this to the other noble families. He's too cheap to buy nice things.

Also, Jackson noted that the twin turret sigil of House Frey was worked into the furniture: the corner posts of the back of Lord Walder's chair look like the two castle turrets of the Twins.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Frey was a minor house of the Riverlands until six hundred years ago. The Lord of the house at that time raised a wooden bridge over the narrowest part of the Green Fork. This Crossing was initially defended by a single tower that overlooked both banks of the river. Now, however, thanks to the wealth they generated through the toll they charged on those who used the bridge, the wooden tower has been replaced by two strong stone ones, from whence they get their name, complete with portcullises, moats and barbicans. The bridge itself is covered and wide enough for two wagons to travel abreast. The Crossing has its own tower, named the Water Tower. House Frey's rise gained them vassal houses of their own: Houses Charlton, Erenford and Haigh.
