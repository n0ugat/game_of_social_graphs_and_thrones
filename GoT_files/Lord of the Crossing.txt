'''Lord of the Crossing'''{{Ref|H&L617}} is a title held by the ruler of the castle complex known as the [[Twins]] and its surrounding lands in the [[Riverlands]]. It is traditionally held by the head of [[House Frey]], a vassal family to [[House Tully]] of the Riverlands. The title stretches back several hundred years, to when the founder of House Frey began charging a toll to cross the wooden bridge over the river.
