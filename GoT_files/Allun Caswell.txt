{{Dialogue a-b|Allun|If I may be of any service?|Rhaenyra|The day may yet come, my lord.|Allun and Rhaenyra Targaryen|The Princess and the Queen}}
Lord '''Allun Caswell''' was the head of [[House Caswell]] during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Allun is one of the [[Blacks]], supporters of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s claim as heir to the [[Iron Throne]].{{Guideref|Allun Caswell}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Allun encounters Rhaenyra when she is summoned to [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s chambers. He congratulates her and [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]] on their newborn son, [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Allun greets Rhaenyra and [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] as they arrive at the Red Keep.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Allun is among the lords who bend the knee and swear fealty to [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] in the [[throne room]], though he hesitates until witnessing the arrests of [[Lord Merryweather]] and [[Lady Fell]]. Shortly after, however, he attempts to leave the Red Keep in a hurry, but is apprehended and interrogated by [[Larys Strong]] and [[Otto Hightower]]. Realizing he is a supporter of Rhaenyra, they respond to his escape attempt by having him hanged in the courtyard of [[Maegor's Holdfast]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', his name is only given as "Lord Caswell." He had at least two sons and one daughter.

Lord Caswell was arrested and later beheaded (not hanged) for refusing to renounce Rhaenyra and swear allegiance to Aegon II. His head was mounted on a spike above the gates of King's Landing, along with those of [[Lord Merryweather]] and [[Lady Fell]].
