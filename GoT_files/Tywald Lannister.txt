In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tywald Lannister was the son of Lord Gerold Lannister, "the Golden", and his second wife Lady Rohanne Webber. He fought on the side of King [[Maekar Targaryen]] during the Peake Uprising in 233 AC and was fatally wounded by a spear at Starpike. He was [[Knighthood|knighted]] by Prince [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon Targaryen]] as he lay dying in his brother [[Tion Lannister|Tion]]'s arms. He asked his brother to "take care of Lady Ellyn" with his dying words, which later led Lord Gerold to agree to a betrothal between Tion and Ellyn.
