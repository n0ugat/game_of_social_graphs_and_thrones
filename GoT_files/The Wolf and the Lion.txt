==Synopsis==
=== In the Vale of Arryn ===
[[Image:In the hills.jpg|thumb|Tyrion Lannister and his escorts in the hills of the Vale.]]
Tyrion Lannister has his blindfold removed and finds that their party, augmented by several knights and the [[Mercenary|sellsword]] [[Bronn]] from the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], is on the [[Eastern Road]] en route to the [[Vale of Arryn]]. Catelyn had been saying that they were riding for [[Winterfell]] often and very loudly. Tyrion congratulates her on her cunning, while pointing out that his father will give out a handsome reward for his safe return, a point that clearly piques Bronn's interest. Tyrion says that Lady Lysa Arryn has gone mad since her husband's death and will try to kill him in the Eyrie. He demands his innocence be known in the attempt on [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s life and points out he'd have to be an idiot to give the assassin his own blade. Before Catelyn can answer, the party comes under attack from one of the [[hill tribes]]. Despite taking several losses, the party is able to drive off the attackers. Though having the opportunity to escape, Tyrion fights, killing his first man in the skirmish, and in doing so, saves Catelyn's life. Afterwards, they resume their trek to the Eyrie.

In the High Hall of the Eyrie, Lady Lysa Arryn holds court on behalf of her young son, [[Robin Arryn|Robin]]. Lysa is furious that Cat has endangered them all by bringing Tyrion to the Vale. Tyrion points out that if he is harmed, there will be war with [[House Lannister]], but Lysa is unconcerned about his threats, as the Vale is strongly-defended and the Eyrie is impregnable. She orders him sent to the sky cells: three-sided cells with the fourth open to a sheer drop down the mountainside. This forces Tyrion to huddle in a corner and try not to roll out to his death in his sleep.

=== At Winterfell ===
[[Image:Bran and Luwin.jpg|thumb|Bran and Maester Luwin discuss geography.]]
In Winterfell, Bran is angry about his mother's absence. [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] tries to set his mind at rest about the matter, to no avail. However, when Bran gets frustrated at not being able to practice his archery, Luwin suggests that he could learn to use a shortbow, of the kind used in mounted combat by the [[Dothraki]], a notion which pleases Bran. Elsewhere in the castle, [[Theon Greyjoy]] enjoys the attentions of his favorite [[Prostitution|whore]], [[Ros]], but becomes annoyed when she compares his prowess unfavorably to that of Tyrion Lannister. 

=== In King's Landing ===
Lord Eddard Stark arrives at the tourney ground to speak to Lord Commander [[Barristan Selmy]] about the death of Ser [[Hugh of the Vale]]. Barristan notes that he had no family or friends so he stood the [[Knighthood|knight]]'s vigil himself for Ser Hugh. Eddard is suspicious of Ser Hugh's death, wanting to know how he could afford a new set of armor so soon after being made a knight. Barristan reflects on the irony of them being on opposite sides of the war during [[Robert's Rebellion]] and now they are working together. 
[[Image:Barristan and Eddard.jpg|thumb|Ser Barristan Selmy and Lord Eddard Stark discuss the death of Ser Hugh.]]
He also tells Eddard that King Robert is planning to joust during the day's activities. Ned finds King Robert tormenting his squire, [[Lancel Lannister]], finally sending him off on a snipe hunt in amused disgust. Robert is adamant about fighting in the joust but Ned tells him that he is too fat for his armor and the other knights would let him win. This frustrates Robert but he is forced to admit that Ned is right but at least they can watch the joust from the stands.

The first tilt of the day is between the fearsome Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], the Mountain, and the popular 'Knight of the Flowers', Ser [[Loras Tyrell]]. Loras gives a beautiful flower to [[Sansa Stark]], while [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] and Lord [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] make a wager on who will win with Renly betting on Loras. Loras is riding a mare that is in heat, which agitates and excites the Mountain's stallion, causing him to throw his rider. 
[[Image:Robert and Lancel.jpg|thumb|King Robert Baratheon is dismayed to find he no longer fits his armor.]]
Enraged at having lost, Gregor first decapitates his horse and then attacks Ser Loras. [[Sandor Clegane]] comes to Loras's defense, preventing his brother from killing him. They exchange several blows, until King Robert orders them to cease. Sandor immediately bows to the king, while Gregor storms off the field. Ser Loras declares Sandor the victor of the match to the Hound's discomfort.

In the [[Red Keep]], Lord [[Varys]] meets with Eddard. Varys tells him that the king is a fool and will soon be dead unless Ned can save him. Ned wants to know why Varys is telling him this now. Varys tells him he had to be sure Ned could be trusted. He calls Ned an honorable and true man, maybe the only one in the city. He also confirms that [[Jon Arryn]] was assassinated with a poison called the [[Tears of Lys]] because he "started asking questions".

Later, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is chasing cats in accordance with her sword training. She chases one into the dungeons under the castle, where she finds the great [[dragon]] skulls of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] in storage. She hears two men talking: Varys and Magister [[Illyrio Mopatis]] of [[Pentos]]. Varys says that events have been set in motion and the [[House Lannister|lion]] and the [[House Stark|wolf]] will soon be at each other's throats. War is almost upon the [[Seven Kingdoms]], as they planned, but it has come too soon. [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] will not invade Westeros until his son is born and pronounced healthy, which is still many months away. Illyrio suggests assassinating Eddard to forestall the war, but Varys refuses.[[Image:Sandor, Gregor & Loras 1x05.jpg|thumb|Sandor, Ser Gregor and Ser Loras at the tournament.]]
Afterwards, Varys finds Littlefinger in the Great Hall staring at the Iron Throne. Varys reveals that he knows about Littlefinger's assistance in Eddard's investigation of Jon Arryn's death and reminds Littlefinger of the consequences that may befall him should the Lannisters discover his involvement. In response, Littlefinger reveals that he already knows about Varys having met with both Eddard and Illyrio just earlier that day, implying he knows of Varys's allegiances across the [[Narrow Sea]]. Their conversation is interrupted by Renly, who informs them that Robert will be joining them at their [[Small Council]] meeting.

Arya escapes from the dungeon and tries to warn her father about what she overheard but she gets the words muddled up. They are interrupted by [[Yoren]], who has ridden non-stop from the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] to bring Eddard forewarning of Catelyn's arrest of Tyrion Lannister. Ned keeps the information to himself, while Arya asks [[Jory Cassel]] about the state of her father's household guard. Jory tells her she does not have to worry about her father's safety.

At the meeting of the Small Council, King Robert tells Eddard that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is pregnant and her son will have a claim to the [[Iron Throne]]. He wants Daenerys, the unborn child, and [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] dead as soon as possible. 
[[Image:Varys and Illyrio.jpg|thumb|Varys secretly meets Illyrio under the Red Keep.]]
Eddard states that this act would be dishonorable, cowardly, and beneath their dignity. The other members of the council: [[Pycelle]], Renly, Littlefinger and Varys, all concur that Daenerys must die for the good of the realm. King Robert orders Ned to enact the order. He refuses and resigns as the [[Hand of the King]], to Robert's utter disbelief and fury.

Eddard orders his household to begin packing. As Ned is packing, Littlefinger arrives and offers to take Ned to the last place Jon Arryn went before he "fell ill". Ned agrees.

Ser Loras and Lord Renly, who are lovers, meet in a bedchamber where Renly complains as Robert is organizing a hunt in the Kingswood, which will no doubt involve traipsing around the forest for a couple of weeks in the cold and rain waiting to kill some animal. Loras urges Renly to claim the crown himself, offering him the allegiance of his [[House Tyrell|rich and powerful family]]. Renly dismisses the notion, since he is fourth in line to the Iron Throne. Loras points out that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] is a monster, that [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] is only eight and laughs at the notion of Robert and Renly's other brother, Lord [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], ever becoming king, as he has the charisma and personality of a lobster. He also asserts that the people love Renly and want to serve him because he is kind and doesn't revel in violence as his brothers do.

Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and Robert share a rare drink and discuss the Targaryen threat. Surprisingly, Cersei takes Eddard's side, pointing out that the [[Dothraki]] cannot cross the [[Narrow Sea]] as they have no ships. 
[[Image:Loras and Renly.jpg|thumb|Ser Loras urges Renly to consider his place in the line of succession.]]
Robert agrees, but if they land and the knights of Westeros take shelter behind their castle walls, the Dothraki could simply burn and pillage their way up and down the continent until the [[smallfolk]] accept Viserys as their king regardless. Cersei suggests that the unified armies of the Seven Kingdoms could defeat them but Robert says she underestimates the skill and ability of one army with one leader and one purpose as compared to that of the scattered and patchwork armies of Westeros. Their discussion moves to [[Lyanna Stark]], which surprises Robert, as in seventeen years Cersei has never asked about her. He tells her that Lyanna's death left in him a void that seven kingdoms could not fill. He also tells her that their marriage never had a chance of success because of the hold Lyanna's memory has on him, and bitterly adds he can barely remember what she looked like. Cersei says that she felt something for Robert once, even after they lost [[Robert Baratheon's son|their first boy]], for quite a while. She asks Robert if there was ever any chance for their marriage and he answers "no".

[[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] brings Eddard Stark to the last place Jon Arryn went before falling ill, which is one of [[Littlefinger's brothel|Littefinger's brothels]]. There Ned meets another one of Robert's bastards, this time a baby [[Barra|girl]] and her mother, a blond whore named [[Mhaegen]]. Mhaegen remarks that her child has Robert's nose and "black" hair. Eddard asks Littlefinger why Jon Arryn was searching for Robert's bastards but he says he doesn't know, offering the half-hearted guess that maybe Robert suddenly took paternal interest in them. Eddard looks skeptical of that reason.

Leaving the brothel, Eddard, [[Jory Cassel]], and the two guards that accompanied them are confronted by a large group of [[House Lannister|Lannister]] guardsmen led by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]. Jaime has heard of Tyrion's arrest and demands an explanation. Ned says that Tyrion was arrested on his orders. 
[[Image:Eddard injured.jpg|right|thumb|Eddard is stabbed through the leg by a Lannister guardsman.]]
Jaime threatens to kill him but Ned points out that if he does, Tyrion will die as well. Jaime acknowledges that this is true, so he says he will settle for killing Eddard's men instead. Ned's two guards, [[Heward]] and [[Wyl (guard)|Wyl]], are killed by Lannister spearmen in the opening seconds of the fight. In response, Ned and Jory fight and kill six of the Lannister soldiers. Jory engages Jaime but is quickly killed when Jaime stabs him through the eye with a dagger. Furious, Ned crosses swords with Jaime. Jaime is shocked and then exhilarated when the older Ned is not as easily defeated as he expected. However, Jaime gradually starts to grow worried as Ned's high level of skill becomes apparent. Just as they are ready to clash again, a Lannister guardsman steps in and stabs Eddard through the leg with a spear, disabling him. Jaime is annoyed at the dishonorable interruption and knocks out the guardsman. He departs, telling Ned he wants his [[Tyrion Lannister|brother]] back.

==Behind the scenes==
* The title is drawn from the dialogue between Varys and Illyrio Mopatis. It refers to the sigils of the House Stark and House Lannister respectively.
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of the [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#Conspiary theme|conspiracy theme]]. It had no official release.
* The first mention of [[Stannis Baratheon]], King Robert's younger brother and Renly's elder, who will not appear until the [[The North Remembers|first episode]] of [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]].
* The first mention of [[House Martell]], the rulers of [[Dorne]], southernmost of the Seven Kingdoms.
[[Image:Eyrie Title Sequence Close.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Eyrie]], as shown in the [[Opening credits (Game of Thrones)|opening credits]].]]
* The [[Opening credits (Game of Thrones)|opening credits]] change again this episode to incorporate the location of the Eyrie.
* The cast members in the stands during the tournament were not informed about the stunt work surrounding Ser [[Hugh of the Vale]]'s death, from the horse falling over to the large amount of prop-blood rigged up to spurt from his neck, so that the reactions of the crowd would be genuine (including Maisie Williams as Arya and Sophie Turner as Sansa).<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays DenOfGeek]</ref>
* A real horse could not, of course, be used for when Gregor Clegane decapitates his mount. A complex puppet and mixture of CGI was used to achieve the effect.
* The episode is dedicated to the memory of production member Caroline Lois Benoist, who had spent some months working on the production as an animal trainer. She passed away on 29 December 2010 from swine flu.
* The scene between Robert and Cersei was written at the last minute because the rough-cut of the episode was running short, and filmed in post-production reshoots, but turned out to be one of the writers' favorite scenes. Note that, as a simple interior shot in Robert's chambers, it didn't need to be filmed on-location.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.</ref>
*Renly states to Loras that he is fourth in line to the throne, behind Robert's sons Joffrey and Tommen, and Renly's older brother Stannis. This excludes Robert's daughter Myrcella, and Stannis's daughter [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]], who in a normal lordship would inherit ahead of their fathers' younger brothers such as Renly. The [[Lordship#Royal Primogeniture|Royal succession laws]] for the Iron Throne are, however, slightly different from those of normal lordships. After a civil war almost two hundred years ago between [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and her younger brother [[Aegon II Targaryen]], the royal succession laws were revised to put female heirs behind all possible male ones. These laws apply to most of the regions of Westeros, except [[Dorne]] and the [[Iron Islands]].
*The second and last time in the show Cersei mentions the boy she and Robert had, following "[[The Kingsroad]]". That confirms she was not lying to Catelyn in order to appear sympathetic and thus remove suspicion from her.
*Bran failed to remember the words of [[House Lannister]] "''Hear me roar!''", perhaps because they are so rarely mentioned, in contrast to its unofficial motto "A Lannister always pays his debts". So far, those words have been mentioned only once in the novels{{Bookref|AGOT|56}} in addition to the appendices, and only once in the show ("[[The Winds of Winter]]"); they have been confirmed in "[[House Lannister (short)|House Lannister]]".
*[[Kate Dickie]] (Lysa Arryn) later said she hoped viewers were aware that she wasn't actually having [[Lino Facioli]] (Sweetrobin Arryn) suckle on her breasts as Lysa disturbingly never weaned her son: she wore prosthetic breasts over her undergarments.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/the-fall-of-lysa-arryn-an-interview-with-kate-dickie/]</ref>
*Varys tells Littlefinger "Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young". The current lord of House Redwyne is [[Paxter Redwyne]], but there is no mentioning in the novels that he is homosexual or pedophile. It is unclear whether Varys was referring to Paxter or other member of his house.
*Ser Barristan Selmy is not present at the meeting of the Small Council (in the parallel book scene he is). In [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]] episode "[[Kissed by Fire]]" it is explained that traditionally, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard has a seat at the council, but Selmy was excluded because Robert did not want advice on how to govern from a Targaryen loyalist (let alone one who killed a dozen of his friends); Selmy did not mind, since he hated politics anyway. 
*Ned tells Robert "I followed you into war - twice", referring to [[Robert's Rebellion]] and the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
*Theon states that the ironborn are famed for their skills at navigation, archery and lovemaking. This is an empty bragging and very far from the truth:
**The ironborn mostly sail from the Iron Islands to the near coasts of the mainland (for raiding), and that hardly requires any special navigation skills. Only a few of them have ever sailed further.
**The ironborn prefer to engage in hand-to-hand combat, using swords and axes, rather than shoot arrows from a safe distance. In fact, Theon is the only ironborn who is ever seen shooting arrows in the show.
***In the books, the ironborn shoot arrows at their opponents only on rare occasions (the harrying of the [[Stony Shore]]).
**The ironborn have a negative reputation as reavers and rapists ("[[The Night Lands]]"); they are definitely not famed as lovers.
*As things [[Battle of King's Landing|turned to be]], Varys and Pycelle - who pointed out that either Daenerys died, or many innocent people would - were right; Ned, who objected to kill her and did not care at all about the consequences, was really acting like a "honorable fool", as Robert called him.
*Ned's act of removing his Hand of the King's badge is similar to what two Hands did many years before ([[Qarlton Chelsted]] and [[Otto Hightower]]) and to the act Tyrion will perform several years later ("[[The Iron Throne]]"). By that act, each of them expressed his disgust and disdain of his respective king's conduct.
