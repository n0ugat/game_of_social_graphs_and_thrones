Prince '''Joffrey Velaryon''' is a [[prince]] of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]] and the third son of Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and Ser [[Laenor Velaryon]]. He is bonded to the dragon [[Tyraxes]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Joffrey is the youngest son of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and [[Laenor Velaryon]]. He has two older brothers, Prince [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] and Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon]] and is presently second-in-line to succeed to the [[Iron Throne]]. Additionally, Joffrey becomes the heir to [[Driftmark]] after Lucerys is murdered at the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

Although presented as legitimate, Joffrey and his brothers are actually [[bastard]]s fathered by Ser [[Harwin Strong]]. He was named in honor of his putative father's deceased lover, Ser [[Joffrey Lonmouth]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Shortly after his birth, Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] summons Rhaenyra so she can see the baby. When she notices that Joffrey has brown hair like his brothers, and unlike his supposed father, Alicent quietly insults Laenor, telling him to "keep trying." He is relocated to Dragonstone, along with the rest of Rhaenyra's court.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

In [[132 AC]],{{Dateref|The Lord of the Tides}} Joffrey is present when his [[Jacaerys Velaryon|older brother]] recites [[High Valyrian]] under the tutelage of Maester [[Gerardys]], he is entertained with a book by his mother's handmaid [[Elinda Massey]]. After [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] arrives, he leaves the chamber with Elinda.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Joffrey witnesses the coronation of his mother at the funeral of his [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|half-sister]], he kneels alongside his brothers, after Rhaenyra is declared Queen.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
During the funeral of his brother [[Lucerys Velaryon]], he is held by his brother [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] and throws a toy horse, formerly in possession of his brother Lucerys, into the funeral pyre.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Rhaenyra sends Joffrey to the [[Eyrie]] following the attempted [[Duel on Dragonstone|assassination]] on her.{{Ref|HOTD203}}
