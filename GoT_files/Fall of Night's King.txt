{{Quote|Lucky for you southerners, the Free Folk rallied to a King-Beyond-the-Wall, as we will when need be, and marched on the ancient castle he'd taken for his own: the Nightfort. With the help of the Starks, we killed the demon and cleansed your precious watch. Then they thanked us, and kicked us back across the Wall, as you always have.|[[Ygritte]]|The Night's Watch}}
The '''fall of Night's King''' was a battle that took place in the [[Age of Heroes]].

==History==
===Prelude===
[[File:NightsKingQueen.jpg|thumb|Night's King and his corpse queen enslaved the black brothers and performed human sacrifices.]]
The thirteenth [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]] found in the [[Haunted Forest]] a [[Corpse queen|cold woman]] with bright blue eyes, seemingly a female [[White Walkers|White Walker]]. He brought her back through the [[Wall]] and declared himself "Night's King" and her his Queen. For thirteen years they ruled over his brothers in the Night's Watch, making human sacrifices.

===Battle===
[[File:Night's_Queen_death.png|thumb|The death of the corpse queen at the hands of Brandon the Breaker.]]
The [[Free Folk]] rallied behind [[Joramun]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] and marched against the [[Nightfort]], which Night's King had taken as his seat, defeating him with the aid of King [[Brandon Stark (Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]] and [[House Stark]].

===Aftermath===
The Free Folk were unceremoniously forced back [[Beyond the Wall]] and the Night's King and Queen were most likely killed for the crimes they committed, releasing the Night's Watch from their dominion.<ref>"[[The Night's Watch]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the [[Brandon Stark (Breaker)|Brandon the Breaker]] (said to be [[Night's King]]'s brother, according to some alternate versions of the tale) and Joramun, the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] formed an alliance to defeat Night's King and free the [[Night's Watch]] from his rule. After his fall, when it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the [[White Walkers|Others]] (possibly in a similar way to [[Craster]]), all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden.

After the defeat of Night's King, the rule was enforced that the castles of the Night's Watch along the [[Wall]] should never be fortified against approach from the south, so that they cannot oppose the lands south of the Wall which they are meant to defend. The downfall of Night's King also resulted in the strict enforcement of the rule that the Night's Watch is meant to be politically neutral, as guardians who do not "rule" the Wall but who serve the realms of men.
