Lord [[Gunthor Darklyn]] refuses to yield to [[Aegon II Targaryen]], and is thus [[Execution|beheaded]] by Ser [[Criston Cole]] after the [[sack of Duskendale]]. Soon after, Criston Cole utilizes levies gathered from House Darklyn in the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]], where many are killed by arrows from the [[House Staunton|castle's defenders]] and dragonfire from [[Meleys]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}

===The Defiance of Duskendale===
Lord [[Denys Darklyn]] petitioned [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aerys II Targaryen]] for a charter that would allow him to levy his own port fees and taxes. The [[Hand of the King]], [[Tywin Lannister]], refused, but Denys knew about the bad relationship between the king and his Hand and invited the king himself to Duskendale. King Aerys traveled to Duskendale with only [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Gwayne Gaunt]] of the [[Kingsguard]] and a small retinue. The moment the king's party arrived at the gates, Denys ambushed them, killing Ser Gwayne and seizing Aerys. He had the king thrown in the dungeons and tortured with petty cruelties such as having his beard pulled. Tywin immediately raised the [[House Lannister|Lannister]], the king's own forces, and the [[royal fleet]] and laid siege to Duskendale. At the advantage of a hostage, Lord Denys threatened to [[Execution|execute]] the king at the first signs of an assault.<ref name="Defiance"/>

After six months of siege, Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] of the Kingsguard infiltrated the town disguised as a beggar and rescued the king from the dungeons, taking an arrow to the chest while narrowly escaping. Lord Darklyn surrendered and begged mercy from the king, but Denys, his wife [[Serala]], and every other member of House Darklyn were executed on King Aerys's orders. Their cousins and bannermen, [[House Hollard]], were reduced to a single member, Ser [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos the Red]].<ref name="Defiance"/>

==In the books==
[[File:House Darklyn ASOIAF.svg|thumb|200px|right|The Darklyn coat of arms in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels: fusily black and gold, seven white escutcheons upon a red tierce.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Darklyn were petty [[First Men]] [[king]]s in the [[Age of Heroes]]. Their most loyal servants of House Hollard gave them three queens during this time. During the age of the Hundred Kingdoms, the Darklyn kingdom of Duskendale ruled the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush]], what would later become [[King's Landing]]. Their kingship ended when the [[Storm King]] Monfryd "the Mighty" Durrandon conquered the Blackwater and Duskendale.

During the [[coming of the Andals]], the Darklyns forced King Togarion Bar Emmon to flee from the northern shore of the Blackwater to Massey's Hook. Even when the [[Andals]] reigned supreme in [[Westeros]], the Darklyns remained powerful, ruling as far as [[Crackclaw Point]].

During [[Aegon's Conquest]], [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and [[Orys Baratheon]] defeated the Darklyns and [[House Mooton|Mootons]] in Aegon's first test. The Darklyns [[Bending the knee|bent the knee]] to [[House Targaryen]] and served them loyally as direct vassals to the crown.

Ser Robin Darklyn was one of the first seven knights of the [[Kingsguard]].  Seven Darklyns eventually joined the Kingsguard, more than any other House, a fact which is referred to in the Darklyns' coat of arms

In ''A Feast for Crows'', [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] arrives at Duskendale, searching for [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. An unnamed maester tells her the history of House Darklyn. She asks an inn servant whether there are still descendants of House Darklyn living in Duskendale; the woman answers there are Dargoods, Darkes, and Darkwoods (these are Houses with a distant kinship to House Darklyn), but the lordly Darklyns are all gone.
