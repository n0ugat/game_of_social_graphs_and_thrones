'''Alyrie Florent'''{{Ref|HOTD201}} was the wife of [[Otto Hightower]] and mother of [[Gwayne Hightower|Gwayne]] and [[Alicent Hightower]].

==Biography==
===Background===

==Behind the scenes==
According to [[Emily Carey]], who portrays young [[Alicent Hightower]], Alyrie was deeply devout to the [[Faith of the Seven]], beliefs that Alicent shares to connect with her late mother.{{Ref|TOGOTPHOTD105}}

In the book ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Alicent's mother was simply never identified, not even which House she was from. She was only mentioned once and in passing: when [[Otto Hightower]] was first named [[Hand of the King]] in the last years of the reign of old King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], he brought "his wife and children" with him to court. Afterward no mention of her is made at all, tacitly implying that she died early in Viserys's reign but not specifying when or how. According to ''[[Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon: Inside the Creation of a Targaryen Dynasty]]'', Alicent's mother died "after a long illness" (as opposed to a death in childbirth like [[Aemma Arryn]]). 

In the main ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the wife of [[Mace Tyrell]], and mother to [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] and [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]], is named [[Alerie Tyrell|Alerie Hightower]] (who is still alive in the books but was cut from the TV series). The TV writers chose a similar name apparently with the logic that "Alerie/Alyrie" is a common name for noblewomen in the southern [[Reach]].

[[House Florent]] is one of the other major noble families in the southern half of the Reach, whose lands are northwest of the Hightowers' at Oldtown. It is common for the major houses in the Reach to intermarry for political alliances: [[Samwell Tarly]]'s mother is [[Melessa Tarly|Melessa Florent]], who is the first cousin to Stannis Baratheon's wife [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse Florent]]. House Florent feels that they were passed over when [[House Targaryen]] awarded rule of the Reach to [[House Tyrell]] instead of them after  [[Aegon's Conquest]], as the Florents were closely related to [[House Gardener]] while the Tyrells were only "upjumped stewards." Otto's own wife being a Florent would line up with how during this time period, only one century after the Conquest, the Hightowers functionally behave as if they are the rulers of the Reach and expect all the other vassals to fall in line behind them - even though the Tyrells are their legal overlords. In response, several of the other bannermen in the north of the Reach - such as [[House Caswell]] - are annoyed that Otto and [[House Hightower]] are overextending their authority.
