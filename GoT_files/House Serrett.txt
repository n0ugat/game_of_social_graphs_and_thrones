'''House Serrett'''{{Ref|GOT206}}{{Note|Lord Serrett's surname is Serrett.}} of [[Silverhill]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. Their lands are located in the woodlands southeast of [[Casterly Rock]] and south of [[Deep Den]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Lord Serrett]] is mentioned in a letter on [[Tywin Lannister]]'s table at [[Harrenhal]] on troop movements.{{Ref|GOT206}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the House Serrett is the Lords of Silverhill. Their sigil is a peacock in his pride on a field of cream. Their words are ''I Have No Rival''.

A very few members of the house appear in the novels, and their role is very minor.

When the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] host assembles for the [[battle on the Green Fork]], Lord Serrett (whose first name is not mentioned) and his retainers are among the bannermen who ride alongside [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]]. After the battle, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] mentions Lord Serrett as one of the people who could be a better choice than himself for the office of [[Hand of the King]].

In ''A Feast for Crows'', when [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] arrives at [[Maidenpool]], she notices that the serjeant at the gates wears the peacock sigil of House Serrett.
