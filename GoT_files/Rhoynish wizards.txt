The '''Rhoynish wizards'''{{Ref|H&L511}} were powerful worshippers of [[Mother Rhoyne]].

==History==
During the [[Rhoynish Wars]], [[Mother Rhoyne]] was said to whisper the secrets of the [[Rhoynar]]'s enemies to them, allowing the Rhoynish wizards to raise walls of water with which to drown their foes. The Rhoynish wizards used the same magic to raise enormous water spouts to defeat the [[dragon]]s of [[Old Valyria|Valyria]].<ref>"[[The River Rhoyne]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the water wizards were said to have defeated the [[Valyrians]] by flooding [[Volon Therys]], washing away half the city.

Despite not being a witch, Queen [[Nymeria]] was called a "witch queen," as it is said that when she brought her people to [[Dorne]] she had Rhoynish water witches whose secret spells made dry streams flow again and deserts bloom.

It is believed that the [[Hammer of waters|hammer of the waters]] summoned by the [[greenseer]]s of the [[Children of the Forest]] may have been a form of water magic.
