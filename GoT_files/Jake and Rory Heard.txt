'''Jake and Rory Heard''' are twin child actors, who are playing 4 year old [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon Targaryen]]<ref>https://www.starnow.co.uk/jakeandroryheard</ref> in [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]. 

Due to child labor laws that restrict the number of hours that a small child actor can work, as is common practice, a set of twins were cast to play one role (dividing up scenes between them).<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/HouseOfTheDragon/comments/t6nhri/baby_targs/</ref>
