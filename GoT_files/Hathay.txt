A '''hathay'''{{Ref|H&L503}} is a cart commonly used in the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Volantis]]. It is pulled by a [[dwarf elephant]]s and driven by [[Slavery|slaves]] whose faces are marked with tattoos of wheels.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, hathays are similar to a [[Westeros]]i oxcart, though they are far more ornate. They are frequently used by persons of quality, as travelling by foot is known to taint visitors in the eyes of the Volantenes and foreign born captains alike.

Each hathay has two huge iron-rimmed wooden wheels and a cushioned bench for passengers. The slaves that drive them tend to be naked except for a breechclout and a pair of sandals.
