{{Quote|Too old.|Ser [[Meryn Trant]]'s opinion on Brea.|The Dance of Dragons (episode)}}
'''Brea''' is a prostitute working at a brothel in [[Braavos]]. 

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Brea is brought to Ser [[Meryn Trant]] by the brothel's [[Braavosi madam|madam]] after he dismisses another whore for being too old. Meryn, however, also finds Brea too old and dismisses her as well.{{Ref|GOT509}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Brea is not a prostitute but the eldest daughter of [[Brusco]], who is not a brothel bouncer but a fishmonger that briefly takes [[Arya Stark|Arya]] in.
