'''Robert's Rebellion''',{{Ref|GOT707}} also known as '''Robert Baratheon's Rebellion''',{{Ref|GOT401}} or the '''War of the Usurper'''{{Ref|H&L115}} to [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] loyalists, was one of the last great civil wars among the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]] that took place approximately seventeen years before the [[War of the Five Kings]] begins, and lasted about one year.<ref name="E2">"[[The Kingsroad]]"</ref> It was sparked by the [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark]] by the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]].

==History==
===Prelude===
[[Aerys II Targaryen]] was [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]] and the last member of [[House Targaryen]] to sit on the [[Iron Throne]]. The [[King]] is nicknamed the Mad King because his reign became increasingly erratic and murderous. Consequently, tensions between House Targaryen and several other [[Great House]]s began to rise. The brutal fallout from [[Prince of Dragonstone|Prince]] [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]'s alleged [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abduction]] of [[Lyanna Stark]] saw many noble houses in the realm rebel against his rule.<ref name="Rebellion viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/roberts-rebellion/ HBO viewers guide, appendices, Robert's Rebellion entry]</ref><ref name="Rhaegar viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/rhaegar-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Rhaegar Targaryen entry]</ref> In truth, however, Lyanna had not been kidnapped; she had eloped with Rhaegar, who had the [[High Septon (Robert's Rebellion)|High Septon]] issue an annulment to his marriage with [[Elia Martell]].

Lyanna was the daughter of [[Rickard Stark]], [[Warden of the North]], and betrothed to [[Robert Baratheon]], the [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]]. [[House Stark]] and [[House Baratheon]] were the first to protest Rhaegar's actions.<ref name="E1">"[[Winter Is Coming]]"</ref><ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/jbaratheon/robert-baratheon/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of King's Landing - Robert Baratheon entry]</ref> [[Brandon Stark]] demanded justice from Aerys in person. Aerys had him arrested for treason and then offered to ransom him to his father Rickard. Aerys summoned Rickard to court and, when he arrived, publicly and very brutally [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|executed]] both father and son.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/aerys-ii-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Aerys II Targaryen entry]</ref><ref>"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref> The brutal murder of Brandon and Rickard engendered much sympathy for the rebels and many houses joined their cause.<ref name="Rebellion viewers guide" />

=== The rebellion ===
[[Jon Arryn]] was the [[Defender of the Vale]], the [[Warden of the East]] and a respected nobleman. Both Rickard's second son [[Eddard Stark]] and Robert were fostered with him as children and became close friends.<ref name="Jon Arryn viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/arryn/jon-arryn/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Arryn - Jon Arryn entry]</ref> When Aerys demanded that Eddard and Robert be turned over to the [[King's Justice]], Lord Jon refused and raised his banners in revolt. The rebels forged an alliance with [[House Tully]] through marriage, with Eddard married to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn Tully]], who previously was to marry Brandon, and the then-middle-aged Jon to the young [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa Tully]].<ref name="E1" /><ref name="Jon Arryn viewers guide" />
[[File:TLD Robert kills Rhaegar.jpg|thumb|Rhaegar is killed by Robert Baratheon.]]
[[Stannis Baratheon]] fought for his elder brother Robert during the war. Aerys used his allies in [[House Tyrell]] to besiege Stannis at [[Storm's End]] for much of the war. Stannis's force was rescued from starvation by the smuggler [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]], who brought a ship full of onions and fish into the castle.<ref>"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref><ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/sbaratheon/davos-seaworth/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of Dragonstone - Davos Seaworth entry]</ref> Rhaegar was killed during the fighting at the [[Battle of the Trident]], slain by Robert himself.<ref name="E1" /> The site of his death is now called the [[Ruby Ford]] because it is believed to be scattered with rubies from the fallen prince's armor.<ref name="E2" />

=== [[Sack of King's Landing]] ===
[[File:HH TLD Sack of King's Landing.jpg|thumb|Tywin Lannister sacks King's Landing.]]
It was in this final hour that [[Tywin Lannister]] decided to join the conflict. He marched with a large force to [[King's Landing]] and asked that he and his bannermen be allowed into the city to aid in its defense. Aerys made the mistake of trusting his old friend and ordered the gates opened. The moment the Lannister host had entered, the Sack of King's Landing ensued.<ref name="Rebellion viewers guide" />[[File:Jamie_Stabs_Aerys.jpg|thumb|Mad Aerys is slain by a member of his own Kingsguard, Ser Jaime Lannister, earning the latter the nickname "Kingslayer."]]

Seeing that he was doomed, Aerys decided to ignite several caches of wildfire placed throughout the city and burn King's Landing to the ground, but was slain by Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]. His final words were "Burn them all."<ref name="E3">"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref><ref>"[[Kissed by Fire]]"</ref><ref>"[[Blood of My Blood]]"</ref>

Aerys had kept Rhaegar's wife Elia of [[House Martell]] and her children in King's Landing to ensure the Martells' loyalty during the conflict, regarded by most to be royal hostages.<ref name="Elia viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-ofthrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/targaryen/elia-targaryen/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Targaryen - Elia Targaryen entry]</ref> During the sacking, Elia was raped and murdered by [[Gregor Clegane]] on the orders of Tywin. Both of her children were also killed.<ref name="Elia viewers guide" />

=== Robert's ascension ===
[[File:Robert Cersei wedding.jpg|thumb|Robert marries Cersei in a Baratheon-Lannister alliance.]]
Robert laid claim to the [[Iron Throne]] because he had been the first to take up arms and had killed Prince Rhaegar personally.<ref name="Rhaegar viewers guide" /> Robert was also the only rebel leader to have a blood link to the Targaryens, as his [[Cassana Baratheon|mother]] had Targaryen blood. The other leaders of the rebellion agreed to bend the knee. Robert was devastated by Lyanna's death, but married [[Cersei Lannister]] as a show of gratitude to her father joining his cause late in the conflict and delivering the capital of King's Landing to him.<ref name="E3" /> Tywin remained the [[Warden of the West]]. Robert named Jon Arryn as his [[Hand of the King|Hand]] while Eddard took his father's role as [[Warden of the North]].<ref name="E1" /> House Tyrell, House Martell and [[House Greyjoy]] swore fealty to Robert to retain their pre-war positions, maintaining the Seven Kingdoms under their new royal House.

=== Aftermath ===
[[File:Daenerys birth.jpg|thumb|Rhaella dies giving birth to Daenerys.]]
The pregnant Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]] fled to the Targaryen's ancestral seat on the island of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. She was accompanied by her youngest son, [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]]. During a famous and violent storm, Rhaella gave birth to a girl, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], and died soon after. The children were taken into exile in the [[Free Cities]] by loyal retainers. Stannis went on to conquer [[Dragonstone]].

[[File:S06E10 - Jon, Ned and Lyanna.png|thumb|The heir to the Targaryen dynasty is given to Ned Stark. ]]
Unknown to most, after the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy]], Eddard found out that Rhaegar had another child, who was also named Aegon Targaryen, by his sister Lyanna. Eddard raised the child as his bastard son, renaming him [[Jon Snow]], to keep him safe from Robert since he would have surely killed Jon if he found out about his true parentage.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

==In the books==
[[File:Robert's_Rebellion_Title_Sequence.png|thumb||The title sequence artistically depicts the Targaryen dragon falling to the Baratheon stag, Stark direwolf, and Lannister lion.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, this civil war took place between sixteen and fourteen years before the beginning of the novels. In the books, the conflict is also called the War of the Usurper by Targaryen loyalists.

The war was sparked when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen kidnapped Lyanna Stark. When Lyanna's father and eldest brother protested this act to King Aerys, he had them both killed in front of the entire Royal Court. Aerys then called for the heads of Lyanna's betrothed, Robert Baratheon, and her second brother Eddard Stark, who were under the care of Jon Arryn. Lord Arryn raised his banners in rebellion against these unjust acts, and sent Robert and Eddard back to their lands to rally their men.

House Tully joined Robert's side after Eddard and Jon married Catelyn and Lysa Tully, respectively, while House Tyrell and House Martell supported the Targaryens. While House Tully did support Robert, the always fractious lords of the Riverlands were heavily divided in the war, and many stayed loyal to the Targaryens. House Lannister sat out most of the war, only entering - on Robert's side - after Robert killed Rhaegar at the Battle of the Trident and his victory was a foregone conclusion.

The rebellion climaxed with the Battle of the Trident, when the rebel armies destroyed the royalist host and killed Prince Rhaegar. Lannister forces, apparently having decided to support the king, arrived at King's Landing to help defend the capital, but then turned on the Targaryens, brutally sacking the city and killing Rhaegar's children. Aerys's other heirs, Viserys and Daenerys, were spirited to safety across the sea by Targaryen loyalists before the garrison of Dragonstone (where the two children were being kept for their safety) could hand them over to Robert. House Tyrell, whose main force had been held up in a lengthy siege at Storm's End, proclaimed loyalty to Robert soon after the sacking of King's Landing, when Eddard arrived with an army to relieve the siege.

In the aftermath of the war, it was discovered that Lyanna Stark had died, so Robert married Cersei in thanks for her father delivering him victory and to secure an alliance between the two Houses.

Elia Martell's brutal murder by the Lannisters during the Sack of King's Landing earned them the lasting enmity of the Martells. As a result of Elia's unnecessary and easily avoidable murder, Dorne became a hotbed of pro-Targaryen sentiment, and it took lengthy negotiations on the part of Jon Arryn for them to grudgingly swear fealty to Robert.
[[File:Baratheon Victory Title Sequence.jpg|thumb|House Baratheon ascends to the Iron Throne in the title sequence.]]
Similarly to the Lannisters, House Greyjoy remained neutral throughout most of the war, under the rule of [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s father Lord Quellon. He had been a strong ruler, though by the rebellion his health was failing. Quellon was not particularly loyal to either side, so he simply wanted the ironborn to wait out the war on the mainland. After Rhaegar died, however, his sons convinced him that they should side with the rebels while they still could, both to get a share of the plunder and to placate Robert, soon to be the new king. They were not yet sure if Tywin Lannister would side with the Targaryens, so most of the [[Iron Fleet]] stayed home to defend against possible attack from the Westerlands. Quellon himself led a raiding fleet of 50 ships to attack the west coast of the Reach. They raided some soft targets, weakly defended villages and towns, but the Reach's main army was focused to the east at Storm's End. At the mouth of the Mander, however, the ironborn were attacked by a dozen Reach ships from the [[Shield Islands]]. They defeated them but lost a dozen of their own ships in the exchange, and Quellon died in the fighting. Balon then returned the fleet home. Overall it was a minimal, token gesture meant to please Robert, with absolutely no significant impact on the war. Characters in the main narrative of the novels have never even ''mentioned'' the Greyjoys' minimal activities in the war (Quellon's raiding is only known of through ''The World of Ice & Fire'' sourcebook). The Greyjoys had no deep allegiance to Robert, however; a few years later Balon attempted (unsuccessfully) to declare independence from the mainland in the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
