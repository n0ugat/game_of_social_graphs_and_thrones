{{Quote|My sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric...|Queen [[Selyse Baratheon]]|Kissed by Fire}}
'''Tommard Baratheon''' was the second son of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Selyse Baratheon]], who died during childbirth along with his other stillborn brothers, [[Petyr Baratheon|Petyr]] and [[Edric Baratheon|Edric]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Selyse had given birth to three stillborn sons, one of whom was Tommard. She sealed their bodies in glass jars.{{Ref|GOT305}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===

==Behind the scenes==
Staff writer [[Bryan Cogman]] came up with the idea of the stillborn fetuses being preserved in jars. Cogman said in an interview, "''It was a proud day for me as a writer when I walked on set and saw those magnificently nasty prop dead babies floating in those jars.''"<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/episodes/3/25-kissed-by-fire/interview/bryan-cogman.html HBO: Game of Thrones: Interview With Bryan Cogman]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention Selyse Baratheon having any sons, live or stillborn.
