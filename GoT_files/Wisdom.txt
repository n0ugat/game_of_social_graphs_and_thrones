{{Quote|Overseeing its purity are the Wisdoms, such as myself, who are adept in the alchemical mysteries.|Wisdom Hallyne|The Alchemist Guild}}
'''Wisdom'''{{Ref|GOT205}} is a title held by fully-trained members of the [[Alchemists' Guild]], commonly known as "pyromancers".

Wisdoms themselves do not prepare [[wildfire]], which members of the order call 'the Substance'. Such risky task is reserved for [[Acolyte]]s, while transportation and storage is reserved for [[apprentice]]s. Wisdoms inspect the result of the Acolytes work to ensure the Substance's purity.
