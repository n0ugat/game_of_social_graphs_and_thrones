==Narration==
'''Robert Baratheon''': ''"Ours is the Fury."''

''These are the words of the black stag of [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]]. A battle cry echoed throughout the [[Westeros|land]] in rebellion, when I, [[Robert Baratheon]], the First of His Name, seized the [[Iron Throne]] from the Mad King, [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]], ending a [[House Targaryen|dynasty]] nearly three hundred years old.''

''House Baratheon was born in the [[Aegon's Conquest|Wars of Conquest]] when [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Dragon]] invaded Westeros. Aegon sent his commander, [[Orys Baratheon]], to take [[Storm's End]].''

''[[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]], the last of the [[Storm King]]s, foolishly left the safety of his stronghold and met the Baratheon warlord in [[Last Storm|open battle]]. Argilac was soundly defeated, and Orys took his lands, his holdings, and his [[Argella Baratheon|daughter]].''

''Orys was said to be a half-brother to Aegon Targaryen. If this were true, a little blood of the dragon mingled with that of the [[House Durrandon|stag]] in those days.''

''The seat of House Baratheon is Storm's End, a legendary keep raised in the [[Age of Heroes]].''

''It overlooks [[Shipbreaker Bay]], where legend has it that [[Durran Godsgrief|Durran]], the first Storm King, raised the keep with the aid of [[Brandon the Builder|Bran the Builder]] of [[House Stark]], forging a centuries-long connection with the [[Stormlands]] and the [[North]].''

''After Aegon's conquest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], the Baratheons remained loyal enough to the crown while Targaryen kings came and went. But loyalty has its limits. When [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar Targaryen,]] Aerys' vile son and heir, [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] [[Lyanna Stark]], my betrothed, my beloved, it was time to act.''

''We raised our banners. Baratheon, [[Eddard Stark|Stark]], [[Jon Arryn]], and the [[House Tully|Tullys]], united in rebellion against Rhaegar and his father, the Mad King. We were victorious and took the [[Iron Throne]].''

''That bit of dragon blood in my veins came in well as it made me a distant relation to the Targaryen dynasty blood of my long-lost ancestor, Orys. The truth of it is I took it.''

''I sit on the Iron Throne. I rule the [[Seven Kingdoms]] from the [[Red Keep]].''
