===King Viserys, First of His Name===
''King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys Targaryen]], First of His Name, reaped the rewards of the [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Old King]]'s labors. [[Westeros]] was at peace, and [[House Targaryen]]'s rule over it was largely uncontested, with the obvious exception of [[Dorne]]. It must be noted that Viserys did not squander his predecessor's legacy. Although the [[Dance of the Dragons|Dance of Dragons]] scarred the [[Seven Kingdoms]] for generations, it would be difficult to lay the blame for it at the feet of the king. It was his love for his children, and his desire to keep the peace that allowed the tensions to fester as they did.''

===Alicent Hightower===
''[[Alicent Hightower|Queen Alicent]] ... not to ... [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Princess <nowiki>[Rhaenyra]</nowiki>]] ... removal as ... [[Dragonstone]]. For [much] ... together at court. [Rhaenyra] ... powerful and popular ... Rhaenyra could ... support of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] ... was an [[House Arryn|Arryn]]. ... marriage with ... granted her access [to the most powerful] single fleet ... may have been ... that would give ... Her uncle, [Daemon,] was considered [to be the most dangerous] man in [[Westeros]] ... Kings and ... learned ... Alicent ...''

===Blood and Cheese===
''[[Blood]] and [[Cheese]], as the histories now remember them, were only the tools of a much more dangerous mind. When Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] heard of [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]]'s death, it is said he sent a raven to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] vowing vengeance - "An eye for an eye. A son for a a son. Lucerys shall be avenged." Even a cursory review of Daemon's history would lead any scholar to assert that he did not make threats lightly or without the fullest intention to follow through. While Daemon Targaryen is largely remember{{Sic|remembered}} for his enemies, he was not a man without friends. Daemon had personally transformed the [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]] from an unruly band of thugs into a well-trained and well-financed militia. For his efforts, he had many favors owed to him by men who knew the lowliest parts of [[King's Landing]]. Still, nothing much more is known about the men who carried out the vengeance. [One was] a former Gold Cloak, while the other [was a ratcatcher] who had done work within the [[Red Keep]] [and therefore] knew its cisterns and tunnels ...hoods prior to the [[Dance of the Dragons|Dance]], their ... Civil War will forever be remembered ... return for both [[Greens|Green]] and [[Blacks|Black]]... [[Orwyle]]'s account, the sun was setting ... when the deed was done.''

===The Rogue Prince and Harrenhal===
''When [[Storm's End]] had been the end of [[Lucerys Velaryon]], the efforts of his older brother [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] had been just. The Lords of [[Winterfell]] and the [[Eyrie]] had remembered their pledges to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], and swore to support her claim to the [[Iron Throne|throne]]. With the [[North]] and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] finally with the [[Blacks]], Rhaenyra and [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] turned their eyes toward the [[Riverlands]].''

''It has been said that Rhaenyra's greatest weapon was not her [[dragon]]s, but her husband, Daemon. An expert on the battlefield, as well as an accomplished strategist. "The Rogue Prince" as he had been called, was one of the most feared men of his day. His legend was such that when Daemon landed his dragon, [[Caraxes]], upon Kingspyre Tower, [[Harrenhal]] immediately surrendered, rather than face a fate similar to the [[Harren Hoare|much hated king]] who was the namesake for the castle.''

''Daemon's control over Harrenhal, and the loss of the Riverlords were causing [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s calculations to fall apart. His grandfather and [[Hand of the King]], Ser [[Otto Hightower]], had made diplomacy the focus of the [[Greens]] efforts. While they had not been unsuccessful, Aegon, like many young and powerful men, had no patience for a strategy. The Crown, the Throne, and the [[King's Landing|Capital]] were his, and all men who opposed him were traitors to the realm. Ser Otto's final gambit was to enlist the help of the [[Kingdom of the Three Daughters|Triarchy]] across the [[Narrow Sea]] - old enemies of Prince Daemon. King Aegon, however, had tired of waiting for others to fight his war for him.''

''King Aegon ... that had served ... well. Blood by ... the king wait ... houses to pledge ... Aegon's first ... Otto as Hand ... place. King [Aegon] ... [[Criston Cole|Cole]] - forever ... Kingmaker ... the Owl Cou... King Viserys ...''

==In the books ==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, ''The Dance of the Dragons, A True Telling'' is noted by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] that Munkun's history contains some inaccuracies, such as indicating that the dragon that killed Ser [[Byron Swann]] was [[Vhagar]], when in fact it was [[Syrax]]. Vhagar was ridden by Prince Aemond Targaryen, a brother and supporter of [[Aegon II Targaryen]], and [[House Swann]] was among the supporters of Aegon II; therefore, it is unlikely Ser Byron attempted to kill Prince Aemond's mount. Meanwhile, Syrax was ridden by Aegon II's rival, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] herself.{{Bookref|ADWD|8}}

Munkun's work was said to be biased in favor of Rhaenyra, in contrast to the history written by Septon Eustace, which was biased in favor of Aegon II.

''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' reveals that Munkun was a member of the council of seven [[Regent]]s that ruled the [[Seven Kingdoms]] after the death of Aegon II, as his successor, his nephew [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon III Targaryen]], was still a child. Munkun was the only member of the council that held office from 131 AC to 136 AC, when the council was dissolved. Munkun would also hold the office of [[Hand of the King]].
