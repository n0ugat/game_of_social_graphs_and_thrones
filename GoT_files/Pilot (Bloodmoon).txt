==Behind the scenes==
*The pilot cost $30 million to $35 million to shoot.<ref name="THR" />
*According to [[George R.R. Martin]], the pilot "revolved around a wedding of a Southern [[Noble house|house]] to a [[North]]ern house and it got into the whole history of the [[White Walkers]]."<ref name="THR" />
**Based on leaked set photos<ref name="Watchers" /> and the words of Martin himself,<ref name="Watchers2" /> it is probable that the houses in question were [[House Casterly|Houses Casterly]] and [[House Stark|Stark]].
*[[Naomi Watts]]'s [[Morven Casterly|Morven]] and [[Amy McPherson]]'s [[Aurelia Casterly|Aurelia]] were mother and daughter, respectively.<ref name="Redanian" />
*[[Leaf]], a [[Children of the Forest|Child of the Forest]] who appeared in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', (previously portrayed by [[Octavia Alexandru]] and [[Kae Alexander]] in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth]] and [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|sixth seasons]], respectively) had a role in the pilot. Taking place during the [[Age of Heroes]], [[4700 BC|almost 5,000 years before]]<ref name="HOTD Book" /> the original series, the character was recast and portrayed by series regular [[Doyin Ajiboye]].<ref name="Redanian" />
*The pilot was not well received, and on October 29, 2019, ''Deadline'' reported that ''Bloodmoon'' would not be moving forward as a series.<ref name="Deadline 1">[https://deadline.com/2019/10/game-of-thrones-prequel-pilot-dead-hbo-jane-goldman-naomi-watts-1202771609/ ‘Game Of Thrones’ Prequel With Naomi Watts Dead At HBO – Deadline]</ref>
**Less than five hours later, ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' received a 10-episode straight-to-series order.<ref name="Deadline 2">[https://deadline.com/2019/10/game-of-thrones-new-series-house-of-the-dragons-targaryen-hbo-max-greenlight-1202771886/ ‘Game Of Thrones’ Prequel ‘House Of The Dragon’ Gets HBO series Order – Deadline]</ref>
*George R.R. Martin has not seen the pilot as it has been locked away.<ref name="THR" />

==In the books==
At the time of the pilot's production, George R.R. Martin had only published about eight lines of text regarding the time period of the proposed series, leaving much of the worldbuilding to [[Jane Goldman]].<ref name="THR" />

In the books, [[Leaf]] did not live during the Age of Heroes, being only roughly 200 years old at the time of ''A Dance with Dragons''. Furthermore the naming convention used for Children of the Forest (Leaf, [[Cloud]], [[Lake]]) is not accurate to the books, as these are nicknames made up by [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Meera Reed|Meera]], not their actual names, which are described as "too long for human tongues."

In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', the Long Night is said to have taken place between 6,000 and 8,000 years prior to the main series. In ''Bloodmoon'', these events transpire less than 5,000 years before ''Game of Thrones''.<ref name="HOTD Book" /> A [[sept]] is depicted in storyboard art from the pilot's production,<ref name="Storyboard" /> which would be in direct contradiction to established lore, as the [[Faith of the Seven]] was introduced to [[Westeros]] during the [[coming of the Andals]], two thousand years after the [[Long Night]].{{Ref|H&L103}} It would appear that the timeline between the Long Night and the coming of the Andals was shortened to an extent where the events occurred in the same time period, which would explain why the Casterlys - living south of the [[Neck]] - would worship the Seven. Both in the books and in current show canon, the Casterlys had died out long before the Andals came to Westeros, and so would not have even been aware the Faith of the Seven existed.{{Ref|H&L123}}
