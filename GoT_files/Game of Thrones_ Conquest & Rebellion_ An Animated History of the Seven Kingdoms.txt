It was released on December 12, 2017 in ''[[Game of Thrones: The Complete Seventh Season]]''.

==Premise==
{{Premise|C&R}}

==Overview==
''Game of Thrones: Conquest & Rebellion'' tells the story of [[Aegon's Conquest]] which first unified the [[Seven Kingdoms]], nearly 300 years before the [[War of the Five Kings]], including the founding of [[King's Landing]] and creation of the [[Iron Throne]].

The second-to-last chapter goes on to describe the [[First Dornish War]] which followed the main phase of the conquest - during which [[House Martell]] alone managed to rebel against Targaryen rule.

The final (super-sized) chapter then briefly glosses over the major wars and crises the Targaryen dynasty faced during the next three centuries, to connect them to the present day. It then gives a more detailed recap of the downfall of the Targaryen dynasty in [[Robert's Rebellion]], ending with that state of events as they were at the beginning of the main live-action narrative in [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' ([[Robert Baratheon]] on the throne, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and her brother [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] living in exile in the [[Free Cities]]).
