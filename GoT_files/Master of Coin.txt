==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Petyr Baelish was appointed Master of Coin by Hand of the King [[Jon Arryn]], around seven years before the beginning of the narrative. Originally, Jon's wife [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]] had convinced her husband to make Baelish the chief customs officer at the port of [[Gulltown]] in the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. Baelish excelled at the position, increasing revenue tenfold, so ten years ago Lord Arryn brought him to King's Landing and gave him a minor position in the royal customs office. Baelish increased gross revenues tenfold, and demonstrated such great skill that Arryn rapidly advanced him through a series of promotions, so that within three years he was named Master of Coin for the entire realm. Robert's reign lasted fifteen years in the books (expanded to seventeen in the TV series), and Littlefinger was only Master of Coin for the last seven years, but it is unstated which person (or persons) may have held the position in the early years of King Robert's reign. Thus Baelish is not a holdover from the previous Targaryen Small Council, in contrast to [[Pycelle]] and [[Varys]], who formerly served under the Mad King.

In "''A Feast for Crows''", Queen Regent Cersei renames the office lord treasurer. She first appoints Lord [[Gyles Rosby]] to take the seat, and after he dies - he is replaced by Ser [[Harys Swyft]], who still has this office by the point the novels reached.
