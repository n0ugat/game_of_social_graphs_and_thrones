'''House Towers'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} of [[Harrenhal]] is an extinct noble house of the [[Riverlands]]. Their sigil was five black towers on white, surrounded by a double tressure red and black.

Their seat was the castle of [[Harrenhal]], which was granted to them after the extinction of [[House Harroway]]. However, the Towers also died out, and the castle was passed on to [[House Strong]].
