==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Cassel is a lesser house in service of the Starks of Winterfell. Their sigil is ten white wolf heads, 4-3-2-1, on grey with a black border. Rodrik's older brother had four sons including Jory, but the other three did not live to adulthood. Rodrik himself was married three times but they gave him only daughters, and his last wife is also dead. Following Rodrik's death, the only surviving member of House Cassel is his daughter Beth, who was taken to the [[Dreadfort]] by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] following the [[Sack of Winterfell]], and her fate is unknown (his other daughters having previously died due to unrevealed circumstances).

It is implied by their coat-of-arms that House Cassel was founded by Lonnel Snow, a [[bastard]] son of Lord Brandon Stark, who was in turn the tenth child of Lord [[Cregan Stark]], hence the reversed Stark colors and the ten wolf heads.
