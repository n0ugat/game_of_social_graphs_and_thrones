'''Wendish Town'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a town in the [[Riverlands]], the region controlled by [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. It is located north of Riverrun, near the [[Blue Fork]] of the [[Trident]] and south of [[Seagard]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Wendish Town is sacked at the outset of the [[War of the Five Kings]]. [[House Lannister|Lannister]] raiders, led by [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]], slip across the border and attack the town. The inhabitants retreat to the holdfast, but the raiders burn it. As the townsfolk flee, they are shot down with arrows.

Ser Raymun Darry tells of the attack to [[Eddard Stark]]; Eddard sends Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] to bring the Mountain to justice.

The town is noted as the home of the popular song ''On a Misty Morn'', one of the songs in the repertoire of the bard [[Marillion]].
