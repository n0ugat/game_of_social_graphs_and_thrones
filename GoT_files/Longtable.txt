'''Longtable'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a castle in the [[Reach]]. The castle is located at the meeting of the [[Mander]] and the [[Blueburn]] rivers. It is the seat of [[House Merryweather]].

==Behind the scenes==
The name is misspelled as "Long Table" on some maps.

==In the books==
In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', Longtable is the seat of House Merryweather. House Merryweather are notable for providing one of the [[Hand of the King|Hands of the King]] under the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], after [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s resignation. Lord Owen Merryweather was the Hand until the early stages of [[Robert's Rebellion]], which he did not take seriously. For his laxity, Aerys stripped him of his lands and sent him into exile, replacing him with Lord Jon Connington of [[Griffin's Roost]]. 

After taking the [[Iron Throne]], [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] restored some of the lands to Owen's heirs, including Longtable. 

The current lord of the house, Orton, is married to the Lady Taena of [[Myr]].
