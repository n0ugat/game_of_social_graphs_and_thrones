'''Bianca''' is a mummer who was a member of [[Izembaro]]'s [[Braavos]]i theater [[Mummers|troupe]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Bianca is a mummer who portrays [[Sansa Stark]] in ''[[The Bloody Hand]]'', a comedic reenactment of the prelude of the [[Westeros]]i [[War of the Five Kings]], performed by [[Izembaro]]'s theater troupe in [[Braavos]]. She is jealous of [[Lady Crane]], who portrays the much larger role of [[Cersei Lannister]] (Sansa only has two lines). As a result of this obvious jealousy, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] suspects Bianca is the one who hired the [[Faceless Men]] to kill Lady Crane, but [[Jaqen H'ghar|Jaqen]] refuses to indulge a girl's speculation.{{Ref|GOT605}}

The next day, as the play finishes, Arya notices Bianca secretly mouthing Lady Crane's lines from backstage, confirming her suspicions. Though Arya poisons Lady Crane's rum, she stops her from drinking it and tells her to watch out for Bianca.{{Ref|GOT606}}

Days later, Arya asks Lady Crane what happened to Bianca. Lady Crane's reply implies that she disfigured Bianca's face enough to make it impossible for Bianca to find more work as an actress, but that she left Bianca alive.{{Ref|GOT608}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Bianca and it is unknown which mummer portrays Sansa. It is Arya, under her guise of "Mercedene" (a.k.a. "Mercy"), who plays the role of a young, sweet maiden who gets raped and murdered by the [[Tyrion Lannister|dwarf]], performed by [[Bobono]], in ''The Bloody Hand''.
