'''Prince of Winterfell'''{{Ref|GOT208}} was the title that [[Theon Greyjoy]] fashioned for himself after [[Capture of Winterfell|taking over]] the castle of [[Winterfell]], the ancestral seat of [[House Stark]], during the [[War of the Five Kings]].<ref>"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Prince of Winterfell is a [[House Stark|Stark]] title held by the heirs to the [[North|Kingdom of the North]]. 

While [[Robb Stark]] is away, [[Bran Stark|Bran]] holds the title, until the castle [[Capture of Winterfell|is seized]] by Theon.

Similarly to [[Balon Greyjoy]], who styles himself King of the Isles and the North (although the ironborn have conquered only a small part of the whole North), Theon declares himself Prince of Winterfell. As a mockery, his sister calls him "Prince of Fools."
