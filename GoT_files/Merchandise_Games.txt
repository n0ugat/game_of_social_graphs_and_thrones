*''[[Game of Thrones: A Telltale Games Series]]'' (2014-2015). An episodic graphic adventure series featuring large amounts of original storyline. The story is set in the background of [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]], following how the War of the Five Kings is playing out at the local level among several minor Houses such as House Forrester. Many main cast members from the live-action series provide the voices for their characters in the game. Plans for a sequel were abruptly canceled when Telltale shut down.
*''[[Game of Thrones (game)|Game of Thrones]]'' (2012) -a role-playing game, for Playstation 3, Xbox 360, and PC. Critical reviews were mixed to negative, and despite a few cast cameos, it contradicts enough information that it wasn't really "connected" to the HBO TV series as such.

==Browser and mobile games==
*''[[Game of Thrones: Ascent]]'' - A Facebook App-based game first released in 2013. No original narrative, with gameplay involving managing a player-created House and building up alliances (it is therefore not strictly part of the "TV continuity"). The game was a 2013 Facebook Game of the Year in the Staff Picks category. Currently has its own separate standalone wiki for keeping track of quests, items, etc.
*''[[Battle for the Iron Throne]]'' (2011) - an online Facebook App game. No original story content. No longer available as of 2015.
*''[[Game of Thrones: Seven Kingdoms]]'' (''Vaporware, Canceled'') - an online browser-based MMORPG. Announced as development in 2012, but repeatedly delayed from release. As of 2024 it seems to have been abandoned entirely.
