'''Michael Eaton''' is a Graphic Artist for ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Eaton began work on the TV series in [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]], working with lead Graphic Designer [[Jim Stanes]], and he has continued to work on the TV series through [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]]. Along with Stanes, he produces the [[Heraldry]], written letters, and other designs that appear on-screen in the TV series.

In Season 1, Eaton worked on some of the tournament heraldry and [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army tent design details.  

In [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]], Eaton continued to work on heraldry designs, as well as the interior design of [[Dragonstone]] castle (including the design for the large carved table map of [[Westeros]]), extensive set dressing of written notes for the [[Guildhall]] set. and the new metal spike motif that [[Joffrey Baratheon]] redecorates the [[Iron Throne]] set with to make it appear more intimidating. He also drew the maps of [[King's Landing]] that [[Tyrion Lannister]]] reads over preparing for the siege of the city.

In [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]], Eaton wrote and illustrated all of the books that [[Shireen Baratheon]] is seen reading. He also developed the design for the [[Harpy]] flag of [[Astapor]] in [[Slaver's Bay]], the embroidered heraldry rose that a [[Tyrell lady]] is seen presenting to [[Olenna Tyrell]], and other maps of Westeros. Eaton also specifically wrote various assorted letters, including the letter that [[Samwell Tarly]] writes for [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] to send to all the lords of Westeros, the letter from [[Walder Frey]] sent to [[Tywin Lannister]]'s [[Small Council]] informing them of the [[Red Wedding]], and the letter that [[Talisa Stark|Talisa]] is seen writing in Valyrian.  

In [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]], Eaton personally designed and handwrote the prop book for the ''[[Book of Brothers]]'', the White Book containing the histories of all the great [[Kingsguard]] that [[Jaime Lannister]] and Joffrey are seen prominently examining in the Season 4 premiere. Eaton also designed the chandelier in the [[White Sword Tower]] during this scene. Also in Season 4, Eaton designed the carved image decorations on the doors of the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] chamber, established the mosaic design in the arena that [[Oberyn Martell]] duels [[Gregor Clegane]], and other maps.
