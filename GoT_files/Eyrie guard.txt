{{Quote|That's far enough.|The Eyrie guard to [[Brienne of Tarth]]|The House of Black and White}}
An '''Eyrie guard''' is a guard at the [[Eyrie]] in service to [[House Arryn]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
He accompanies [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] from [[Runestone]]. During their stay at an inn, he stands guard as [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] approaches them and tries to convince Sansa to allow her to be her protector. He attempts to stop her when she turns to leave, and she promptly knocks him out.{{Ref|GOT502}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are several knights, hedge knights, and men-at-arms in Littlefinger's service once he becomes [[Lord Protector]] of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]. Among them are Ser [[Lothor Brune]], Oswell "Kettleblack" and Ser Shadrich of the Shady Glen "the Mad Mouse", though it is unclear if this man is supposed to be any of them.
