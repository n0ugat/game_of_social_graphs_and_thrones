''They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end.''

''The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies;''

''The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned;''

''Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes.''

''A fly upon the wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned;''

''The city of a thousand years, and all that men had learned;''

''The Doom consumed it all alike, and neither of them turned.''
