'''Septons'''{{Ref|GOT109}} are the male clergy of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. They preside over religious ceremonies such as weddings. They have taken vows of celibacy, and often take important positions in a noble's household, attending the local septs at castles and keeps. In contrast, female clergy are known as [[septa]]s. The leader of the Faith of the Seven is known as the [[High Septon]], chosen among the [[Most Devout]].
