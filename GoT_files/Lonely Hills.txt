The '''Lonely Hills'''{{Ref|GOT505}} are a series of hills in the [[North]], within the lands of [[House Umber]].

They are located east of [[Long Lake]], just northwest of the [[Dreadfort]], and some distance south from [[Last Hearth]] and the [[Last River]].

The [[White Knife]] river flows south out of Long Lake to the west: a tributary of the White Knife originates in the Lonely Hills, merging with the main river further south.
