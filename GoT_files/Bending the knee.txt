'''Bending the knee'''{{Ref|GOT707}} is a formal act of submission to a [[king]], queen or lord, a recognition of authority and a demonstration of fealty. It is common for surrendering parties to bend the knee after being defeated in a war or rebellion; in return, the ruling king or lord will usually treat those that bend the knee with leniency, as was the case when [[Torrhen Stark]], the King in the North, bent the knee to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] to spare the lives of the people of the North, and was named [[Warden of the North]] by Aegon in return.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, bending the knee is mostly considered shameful and disgraceful, but there are exceptions: for instance, Balon Greyjoy believes there is no shame in yielding. He taught [[Yara Greyjoy|his daughter]] "No man has ever died from bending his knee. He who kneels may rise again, blade in hand. He who will not kneel stays dead, stiff legs and all". Balon has proved the truth of his own words when [[Greyjoy Rebellion|his first rebellion]] failed; he bent the knee to the Baratheons and Starks, only to rise again when Robert Baratheon and Eddard Stark were dead.

Asha follows her father's advice after she is [[Fight by Deepwood Motte#In the books|defeated]] and captured by Stannis. She tells him "I yield, Your Grace. Do as you wish with me. I ask only that you spare my men". Stannis agrees to spare her and the very few survivors of her troops.
