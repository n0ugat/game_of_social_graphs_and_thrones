Glynn-Carney first spoke about playing the role the Spring 2022 issue of ''Wonderland'':

:''"It's definitely one of the darker roles I've played. It's a very, very complex character. One minute we love him, then the next we hate him, but I'm really enjoying that sort of back and forth aspect of the role. It's a tricky thing to play, but it's rewarding in so many ways."''<ref>[https://winteriscoming.net/2022/04/04/house-of-the-dragon-aegon-ii-targaryen-darker-roles-played-tom-glynn-carney/ ]</ref>
