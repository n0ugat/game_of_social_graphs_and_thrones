'''Hull'''{{Ref|HOTD202}} is a port town on the coast of [[Driftmark]].

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Hull is located beneath the walls of [[Castle Driftmark]], the former seat of [[House Velaryon]]. It was formed from three separate fishing villages that grew in size thanks to the wealth brought by [[Corlys Velaryon]] on his voyages.{{Bookref|F&B|12}}
