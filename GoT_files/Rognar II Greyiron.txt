King '''Rognar II Greyiron'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the [[King of the Iron Islands]] during the [[coming of the Andals]].

==Biography==
When the [[Andals]] attacked the [[Iron Islands]] in an attempt to convert the [[Ironborn]] to the [[Faith of the Seven]], they were able to bring down and kill King Rognar, but they eventually turned to the [[Drowned God]] themselves.{{Ref|H&L217}}

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Rognar's story is told in a wider context. While the ''[[Histories & Lore]]'' video "[[The Drowned God]]" presents his death as a defeat for the ironborn and part of an Andal conquest, Rognar was in fact brought down by an alliance of Andal pirates, sellswords and warlords, along with the Orkwoods, [[House Drumm|Drumms]], [[House Hoare|Hoares]], and [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]]. House Greyiron had ruled the Iron Islands as hereditary kings and abolished the [[kingsmoot]], but with the death of their last king, Harras Hoare become king, winning the crown in a contest of the finger dance according to the tales.
