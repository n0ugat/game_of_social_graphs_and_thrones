'''Moon tea'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a medicinal herbal tea used in [[Westeros]] and beyond to prevent and abort pregnancies. 

It can be made by [[Order of Maesters|maesters]], though if it is not brewed carefully it can lead to negative side-effects.{{Ref|HOTD104}} Even well-prepared moon tea prepared by a Grand Maester can often cause temporary discomfort in the gut.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] takes moon tea prepared for her by [[Mellos]] on [[Viserys I Targaryen|her father]]'s orders.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

Over fifteen years later, [[Talya]] gives [[Dyana]] moon tea on [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s orders, after the serving girl was raped by [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Pregnant with [[Criston Cole]]'s baby, Alicent drinks moon tea prepared by [[Orwyle]] to rid herself of it.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, moon tea, also called tansy tea, is commonly used in Westeros. According to [[Lysa Arryn]], it is made with tansy, mint, wormwood, a spoon of honey, and a drop of pennyroyal.{{Bookref|ASOS|80}} It can be produced upon request by castle maesters, as well as [[woods witch]]es or other local apothecaries. According to [[George R.R. Martin]], tansy and pennyroyal are powerful and dangerous natural abortifacients, so he was purposely vague and added a few fantasy touches to moon tea, to make sure no one tried them in real life.<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/A_Myriad_of_Questions/ So Spake Martin, March 27, 2002]</ref>

In ''House of the Dragon'' Season 1, Mellos mentions that if moon tea is not carefully prepared it can cause negative side-effects. In the books, it is implied that forcing Lysa to take it to give her an abortion damaged her reproductive organs, leading to a string to miscarriages that had a severe effect on her mental health before she finally produced her son Sweetrobin. In ''House of the Dragon'' Season 2, Orwyle says it's been known to cause some temporary discomfort to the gut (which hasn't been explicitly mentioned in the books).

It is unclear what the attitudes are towards abortion by the major religions in Westeros: if they do not oppose abortion due to moral objections, or if they officially oppose abortion, but the rule is very commonly ignored and difficult to enforce in a decentralized medieval society. Devout members of the [[Faith of the Seven]] apparently consider the use of moon tea to be murder, as the [[High Sparrow]] reacted to the information that Margaery Tyrell had taken moon tea by saying "She has drunk of moon tea, to murder the fruit of her fornications in her womb."{{Bookref|AFFC|43}}

While moon tea was never mentioned in the ''Game of Thrones'' TV series, it was first referred to by name starting in the third novel. Several characters have used or considered using moon tea in the books:

*Shortly before her death, Lysa reveals that [[Hoster Tully|her father]] forced her to drink moon tea to abort [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]'s child.{{Bookref|ASOS|80}}
*After losing her maidenhead to a [[Lys]]ene sailor, [[Yara Greyjoy|Asha Greyjoy]] learned from a woods witch how to make moon tea.{{Bookref|AFFC|11}}
*After sleeping with Ser [[Arys Oakheart]], Arianne Martell drinks a cup of moon tea.{{Bookref|AFFC|13}}
*Under pressure, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] learns from [[Pycelle]] that [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] asked him for moon tea. She takes it as evidence that Margaery has been unfaithful to [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]].{{Bookref|AFFC|39}}
*The [[Free Folk]] beyond the Wall also know how to make moon tea. After [[Jon Snow]] has sex with [[Ygritte]] he reiterates that he is terrified of leaving her with an unwanted bastard child, to which [[Tormund]] casually remarks that if Ygritte gets pregnant but doesn't want to have his child, she'll just decide to obtain moon tea from a local woods witch.{{Bookref|ASOS|15}}

''[[Fire & Blood]]'' does not specifically mention that [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] or [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] ever took moon tea or was ever presented with it. This is an invention of the TV series, though due to the "unreliable narrator" nature of the text as an in-universe history book with conflicting sources, it is possible: affairs conducted in private or in secret wouldn't have left a record in the historical sources.
