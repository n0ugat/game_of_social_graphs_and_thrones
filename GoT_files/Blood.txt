{{Quote|Fuck the Hightowers.|Blood|A Son for a Son}}
'''Blood''' was a member of the [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|City Watch of King's Landing]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Blood was a gold cloak from King's Landing who has served in the City Watch since [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] was the commander. He has a great dislike for [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|House Hightower]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:S2 Blood 2.png|thumb|Blood and Daemon meet at the gates.]]
One night Blood is patrolling near one of the city gates, when a hooded figure places a sack of coins between the bars of the gate, proclaiming it to be a tribute. As Blood approaches, he recognizes his former commander, Daemon. When the latter whispers that he has heard of the gold cloak's hatred for the Hightowers, Blood curses the Hightowers and lets Daemon in. The pair search the streets of the city until they find [[Cheese]], a ratcatcher who is eating dinner with his dog. Daemon tells them to kill Aemond; when he is asked what to do should they not find him, Daemon gives a grin.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

The two use the catacombs to enter the Red Keep and find their way to the throne room, overhearing Aegon and his friends drinking and talking, and walk across the back of the room to avoid notice. Later in another secret passageway, Cheese says they cannot walk around the royal chambers as he is only cleared for the main floors, but Blood angrily points out that they're being paid to kill a royal, so they need to go to the royal chambers to find one. Cheese relents and says he does know of a staircase that leads up to them but he won't know his way around once they get there, so they'll have to slowly figure out where Aemond is while avoiding detection.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

The two manage to reach a room where Aemond had previously been, but find it empty. The two split up to search, and Blood says to set some rat traps for appearances. Blood then rounded a corner and is seen by a handmaid, and though he points out his rat traps, when he turns around she has fled, apparently not believing him. Realizing they don't have much time until the guards may be roused, he rushes to find Cheese.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Blood finds his partner in Queen [[Helaena Targaryen]]'s chamber, holding a knife to her throat. Blood says Daemon told them not to leave empty-handed, and (if they couldn't find Aemond) to at least claim "a son for a son"—but Aegon's wife isn't a son. Cheese points across the darkened room and Blood sees that Aegon's twin son and daughter, [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]], are asleep in their beds.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Unable to tell the twins apart, and rushing before the handmaid can alert the guards (so they don't have time to check), Blood insists that Helaena quickly point out which one is the boy. Cheese says they'll just kill all three of them if she doesn't answer right away. Terrified, she tries to bribe them with her necklace but they ignore it. Realizing the most she can do is save her daughter, Helaena points to her son Jaehaerys. Blood initially assumes Helaena is lying, insisting she wouldn't sacrifice the King's heir so readily, but Cheese concludes she's telling the truth.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

They shove her aside and quickly rush to Jaehaerys. Aghast, while they were distracted she quickly scoopsed up her daughter and turns to flee the room. Behind her, the assassins covered the boy's mouth as young Jaehaerys wakes up screaming, and stabbed him to death. The two hack the boy's head off as his mother flees to find help.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Blood is caught later that night, attempting to flee the city at the Gate of the Gods with Jaehaerys's head in a sack. He is taken to a cell in the Red Keep and kept chained under watch. He is visited by Lord Larys Strong, and upon seeing the array of torture instruments laid out, immediately confesses to having been hired by Daemon, having been paid half before, and half for when the job was done, and gives up Cheese while admitting he didn't catch his partner's real name. Blood asks if Larys was going to hurt him, to which the Master of Whisperers says he will not, but cannot speak for the king. Aegon arrives in the cell with a mace. After a brief, tense moment of staring, Aegon beats the scared guard to death.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

==Behind the scenes==
Blood is codenamed "Boris" in casting calls, in which he is described as large, tough, very tall, a man willing to do violence without question, and as someone who has comedic chops.{{Webref|name=Casting |author=Gravemaster |date=February 3, 2023 |url=https://redanianintelligence.com/2023/02/03/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-casting-two-more-roles-including-blood/ |title=House of the Dragon Season 2 Casting Two More Roles, including Blood |website=Redanian Intelligence |access-date=December 6, 2023 }} This last detail was dropped during filming.{{Webref|name=EW |author=Nick Romano |date=June 16, 2024 |url=https://ew.com/blood-cheese-house-of-the-dragon-season-2-book-changes-explained-exclusive-8663564 |title=Blood and Cheese speak!

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Blood was a big, brutal hulking swordsman. His true name is unknown. He was a serjeant of the City Watch of King's Landing, but he lost his cloak when he beat a [[Prostitution|whore]] to death in a drunken rage. Following his dismissal, he spent time in [[Flea Bottom]].

Daemon did not personally hire Blood and his accomplice but via a [[Mysaria|middleperson]], thus it is doubtful Blood knew who ordered the assassination.

Blood was seized two days after the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen]] at the Gate of the Gods, while attempting to bring his victim's head to Daemon and collect his reward. Under torture, he admitted that he had been hired by a woman whose description matched Mysaria, but did not mention his accomplice or Daemon. He died on the thirteenth day of torture. The enraged Alicent ordered Larys to find out his true name so she could settle the score with his wife and children, but the book sources do not say if this occurred (or whether he had a family).
