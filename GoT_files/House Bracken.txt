'''House Bracken'''{{Guideref|Viewer's Guide}} of [[Stone Hedge]] is a noble house of the [[Riverlands]]. Their lands are in the heart of the Riverlands, located along the banks of the [[Red Fork]] of the [[Trident]]. Their current lord is [[Jonos Bracken]]. House Bracken's sigil is a red stallion on a gold field.

==History==
===Background===
The Brackens hold an ancient grudge against their neighbors, [[House Blackwood]] of [[Raventree Hall]]. The two houses, both of which have the blood of the [[First Men]] in their veins, competed for the throne of the Riverlands when it was an independent kingdom. The enmity and competition continue to this day and was increased when House Bracken converted to the [[Faith of the Seven]].<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season1/#!/locations/stone-hedge/ HBO viewers guide, season 1 map, Stone Hedge entry]</ref>

During [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s tour of the realm, she stops at [[Storm's End]], where [[Jerrel Bracken]] is slain in a duel by [[Willem Blackwood]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

House Bracken illegally annexes land owned by House Blackwood, causing Lord [[Samwell Blackwood]] to send a complaint to the [[Small Council]].{{Ref|HOTD106}} The dispute is ultimately handled by [[House Tully/House of the Dragon|House Tully]] with an assize and the establishment of boundary stones to demarcate the border.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Lord [[Amos Bracken]] swears allegiance to King [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] at the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
While near the border with House Blackwood, Ser [[Aeron Bracken]], a knight of House Bracken and nephew of Lord Amos Bracken, and his group are accosted by [[Davos Blackwood]] and a group of his own. The two quickly get into a heated argument, with both men denouncing each other, their respective houses, and the side their house supported in the wider conflict of the Dance, culminating in Aeron drawing his sword on Davos. Sometime later, House Bracken launches an [[Battle at the Burning Mill|attack]] against House Blackwood in an area that would come to be known as the [[Burning Mill]]. During the battle, both sides sustained heavy losses, Aeron among them.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Sometime after [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] [[Taking of Harrenhal|claims]] [[Harrenhal]] for the [[Blacks]], Amos meets with Daemon atop [[Caraxes]] and Willem Blackwood. Daemon gives simple terms to Amos and his Bracken retinue: House Bracken renounce Aegon and bend to him or refuse and their House burns. Amos promptly refuses, declaring him and his house would rather burn then stand alongside the Blackwoods. Daemon ultimately allows Amos and his retinue to depart without incident.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

House Blackwood launches a raid on Bracken land, kidnapping Bracken women and children. Following this, Lord Amos Bracken agrees to swear fealty to the Blacks.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Bracken is a loyal vassal of the Tullys. The enmity between Brackens and Blackwoods was radically exacerbated when Ser Otho Bracken slew Lord Quentyn Blackwood in a tourney accident roughly a century ago, and it still exists at present - even when the two houses were temporarily on the same side at the [[War of the Five Kings]].

The sigil of House Bracken is slightly different in the books: like the TV series, it consists of a red stallion on gold, however, in the books the outside edge of the gold field also has a brown border - though it was ''briefly'' shown surmounting a brown escutcheon at the tournament in Season 1.

House Bracken suffers a lot during the war: [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] steals its harvest, burns everything he cannot carry off, puts Lord Jonos's castle to the torch and rapes one of his daughters.{{Bookref|ADWD|48}} Yet, following the [[Red Wedding]], House Bracken yields to the Iron Throne, since Lord Jonos (similarly to many of the Riverlords) figures there is no point to keep fighting for a lost cause.

After receiving a pardon,{{Bookref|ASOS|72}} Lord Jonos besieges [[Raventree Hall]], the castle of his nemesis Lord Tytos Blackwood, on behalf of the Iron Throne.{{Bookref|ASOS|74}} Since the rivalry between the Blackwoods and Brackens goes back thousands of years, neither side asks for a parley. Eventually, Jaime arrives and persuades Lord Tytos, non-violently, to surrender.{{Bookref|ADWD|48}}

With unspecified familiar relationship to the main branch of the house there is also:

*Lord Bracken's daughter. One of the possible matches for [[Brynden Tully]] in his youth. Possibly a sister of Lord Jonos.
