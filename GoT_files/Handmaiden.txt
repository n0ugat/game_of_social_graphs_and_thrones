A '''handmaiden''',{{Ref|GOT203}} also known as a '''lady-in-waiting''',{{Ref|HOTD109}} is a woman in the service of a noblewoman of higher status. Women of vassal Houses sometimes also serve as handmaidens and companions to noble ladies in the household of their overlords or at the royal court.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the tasks of handmaidens or "lady attendants" vary depending on their origin. [[Noble house|Highborn]] women aid and accompany higher-status ladies and even share their beds but do not perform tasks such as preparing baths or emptying chamber pots, which are reserved for [[smallfolk|lowborn]] women.
