==Premise==
{{Premise|H&L123}}

==Narration==
'''Tywin Lannister''': ''On the far [[Westerlands|western coast]] of the [[Westeros|continent]], high atop a rocky promontory overlooking the [[Sunset Sea]], sits [[Casterly Rock]], ancestral seat of [[House Lannister]].''

''Below it lies [[Lannisport]], one of the great cities of Westeros. A center of trade, culture, and the great Lannister fleet.''

''There are a number of gold and silver mines in the [[Westerlands]], making it the richest region in all of Westeros.''

''One of our most productive gold mines lies beneath Casterly Rock itself, making House Lannister the wealthiest of all the noble houses. This allows House Lannister to fund many endeavors of other noble houses. Even the king himself has sought credit from Casterly Rock from time to time.''

''We Lannisters claim our descent from the [[Andals|Andal]] [[Coming of the Andals|invaders]] and, through the female bloodline, [[Lann the Clever]].''

''According to the legend, Lann, using only his wits, won Casterly Rock from the noble house of [[House Casterly|Casterly]] during the [[Age of Heroes]].''

''The Lannisters reigned as [[King of the Rock|Kings of the Rock]] for thousands of years and worked to make it the envy of the rest of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Our time as kings ended, however, when [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]], otherwise known as Aegon the Conqueror, [[Aegon's Conquest|arrived]] in Westeros with his army.''

''The last King of the Rock, King [[Loren I Lannister|Loren Lannister]], joined forces with King [[Mern IX Gardener|Mern Gardener]], the [[King of the Reach]]. Together, with sixty thousand men, they met the Targaryen host in open battle.''

''History tells us that Aegon unleashed all [[Meraxes|three]] of [[Balerion|his]] [[Vhagar|dragons]], slaughtering four thousand men at what came to be known as "the [[Field of Fire]]."''

''King Mern himself was burned alive that day, and [[House Gardener]] turned to ash with him.''

''Seeing both the threat and ''opportunity'' the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] represented, Loren wisely surrendered and aided Aegon in his further conquest of Westeros. The Lannisters were thus appointed Lords Paramount of the Westerlands and [[Warden of the West|Wardens of the West]], titles we hold to this day.''

''Let us be clear. It is neither luck nor royal favor that makes our House prosperous. There have been times in our history when some have considered thought us weak, lazy, or opulent.''

''My father, [[Tytos Lannister]], nearly bankrupted our House with his poor investments and allowed himself to be mocked openly at court.''

''When our vassal, the [[House Reyne|Reynes]] of [[Castamere]], dared to [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt|rise]] against the Lannisters, they learned how dangerous it can be to taunt a lion.''

''I, [[Tywin Lannister]], personally led the assault on Castamere to put down this rebellion. I made an example of them, to anyone who doubts our might.''

''They even made a [[The Rains of Castamere|quaint song]] about the fate of the Reynes of Castamere. But sadly, there are no Reynes left to hear it.''

''Today the golden Lion of Lannister is rightly admired and feared throughout the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Our words are "Hear me Roar," but there are of other words that should be remembered when crossing a lion of Casterly Rock. "A Lannister always pays his debts."''

==Behind the scenes==
*The official motto of House Lannister ''Hear me Roar!'' is confirmed in this feature. It has been mentioned only once in the show ("[[The Winds of Winter]]"), and only once in the novels{{Bookref|AGOT|56}} (in addition to the appendices). The Lannisters' unofficial motto "A Lannister always pays his debts" is mentioned far more often, both in the show and the novels.
*According to the novels, [[House Tarbeck]] participated in the [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt]]; Tywin does not mention that house, neither in this short nor in "[[The Westerlands]]", as if the Reynes alone rebelled against the Lannisters; Cersei does not mention the Tarbecks either when she speaks about the rebellion in the show ("[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"). Only in "[[The Rains of Castamere (Histories & Lore)|The Rains of Castamere]]" it is explicitly said that the Tarbecks participated in the rebellion.

==In the books==
* The short is adapted from the following chapters of ''A Storm of Swords'':
**Chapter 19, Tyrion III: [[Tyrion Lannister|A Lannister]] relates to the story about the [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt]], and to [[The Rains of Castamere|the song]] about it.
**Chapter 66, Tyrion IX: [[Kevan Lannister|A Lannister]] tells how the Lannisters' bannermen used to openly mock Lord [[Tytos Lannister]].
