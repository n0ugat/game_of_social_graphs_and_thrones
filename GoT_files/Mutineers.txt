The '''Mutineers​''' are a group of sworn brothers of the [[Night's Watch]] who, after surviving the [[fight at the Fist]] and taking shelter at [[Craster's Keep]], break their vows and carry out a [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|mutiny]] against the Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]].

The group was formed due to being infuriated with the way their host [[Craster]] had been treating them and Mormont's refusal to stand up to him. Following the death of murders of Craster and Mormont, 11 mutineers remain at the keep with [[Karl Tanner]] assuming leadership of the Mutineers. However, back at [[Castle Black]], [[Jon Snow]] insists that they be brought to justice, lest they divulge any information about the castle's defenses to [[Mance Rayder]] and his approaching horde of [[Free Folk|Wildlings]]. All of the mutineers are slain during a [[Raid on Craster's Keep|raid]] by a loyal group of Night's Watch men led by Jon. 

==Known Mutineers==
*{[[Karl Tanner]]}, who kills [[Craster]], committing a grave violation against the sacred [[guest right]] and the laws of hospitality. Considered the leader of the Mutineers. Killed by Jon Snow in the [[Raid on Craster's Keep]].
*{[[Rast]]}, who murders Lord Commander Mormont. Killed by [[Ghost]] shortly after the Raid on Craster's Keep.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the "Betrayers" - as they are called in the Appendix to ''A Dance with Dragons'' - are led by Dirk and Ollo Lophand, who kill [[Craster]] and Lord Commander Mormont, respectively. [[Rast]] isn't present because he had remained at [[Castle Black]]. Grenn and about dozen more remain loyal to Mormont, and they are outnumbered 1:2 by the Betrayers, hence the Betrayers are at least twenty. 

The Betrayers who are specifically mentioned in the books are:
{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}
*Dirk
*Ollo Lophand
*Grubbs
*Garth of Greenaway
*Alan of [[Rosby]]
{{Col-2}}
*{Rolley of [[Sisterton]]}. Fell from the loft at Craster's Keep and broke his neck
*Mawney
*Clubfoot [[Karl Tanner|Karl]]
*"Orphan" Oss
*"Muttering" Bill
{{Col-end}}

Some of these mutinous black brothers had been involved in a conspiracy to kill Lord Commander Mormont and several other members of the Night's Watch to ensure the end of the [[great ranging]] and facilitate their desertion. However, the sudden snowfall and the [[fight at the Fist]] made the conspiracy pointless. A few men who had been discussing betrayal before the massacre at the Fist ultimately stay loyal during the mutiny, while some other men who weren't part of the earlier plot spontaneously join the betrayal when it breaks out.

No punitive action by the Watch is ever taken against the Betrayers. Ollo Lophand and four others are killed by a mysterious person known as "Coldhands", who accompanies [[Bran Stark]] and his escorts. Bran wargs into [[Summer]] and finds their bodies. It is unknown what has become of the remaining Betrayers.

Those who remain loyal to Mormont and the Watch are:
{{Col-begin}}{{Col-2}}
*[[Grenn]]
*[[Samwell Tarly]]
*[[Eddison Tollett]]
*Dywen
*Bedwyck aka "Giant"
*[[Donnel Hill|"Sweet" Donnel Hill]]
*Ulmer
{{Col-2}}
*Left-Hand Lew
*Garth Greyfeather
*Kedge Whiteye
*Black Bernarr
*Tim Stone
*Goady
{{Col-end}}

All the above Loyalists, except Sam, do not engage in fight with the Betrayers but escape. They arrive at [[Castle Black]] long before [[Jon Snow]]. Sam eventually escapes with [[Gilly]] after being urged to do so by some of Craster's wives, and they arrive to Castle Black much later.
