'''Haggo'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[bloodrider]] to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Haggo is a [[Dothraki]] [[bloodrider]] in the service of Khal Drogo. He is one of Drogo's closest allies and a stalwart warrior who favors the ''[[arakh]]''. Unlike [[Cohollo]] and [[Qotho]], Haggo wears a leather vest as protection.{{Ref|GOT101}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Haggo, alongside [[Qotho]] and [[Cohollo]], accompanies Khal [[Drogo]] to view his bride, [[Daenerys Targaryen]].{{Ref|GOT101}}

Haggo is present at the feast in which a drunken [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] threatens Daenerys and her [[Rhaego|unborn child]]. He doesn't take part when Drogo orders Qotho and Cohollo to restrain him while Drogo pours molten gold over his head, killing him.{{Ref|GOT106}}

Following the [[Raiding|raid]] of a [[Lhazareen]] village in [[Lhazar]], [[Mago]] defies Drogo. Haggo, along with his fellow [[bloodrider]]s, steps forward to defend Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters in his own hands.{{Ref|GOT108}}

Drogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from [[Drogo's stallion|his stallion]] in front of the khalasar, a sign of great weakness. While Daenerys and then Cohollo kneel to the sides of the khal to check on him, Haggo remains mounted alongside [[Qotho]].{{Ref|GOT109}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Haggo is another of Drogo's bloodriders. During the wedding of Daenerys and Drogo, Haggo gives them a large leather whip with a silver handle. When the three bloodriders attempt to stop the [[Mirri Maz Duur]]'s [[bloodmagic]] ritual to heal Drogo, Haggo is killed by [[Rakharo]] and Jhogo.
