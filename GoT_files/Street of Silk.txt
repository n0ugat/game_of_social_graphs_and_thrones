The '''Street of Silk'''{{Ref|HOTD101}} is a street in [[King's Landing]] known for its [[Prostitution|brothels]].{{Ref|H&L801}}

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
While searching for [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] tells Ser [[Criston Cole]] that when he was 13 years old, Aegon brought him to the Street of Silk for "education."{{Ref|HOTD109}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Street of Silk is located on the Hill of Rhaenys leading up to the [[Dragonpit]] by the west.

In ''A Feast for Crows'', [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] commands the [[Lord Commander]] of the [[City Watch of King's Landing]], Ser [[Addam Marbrand]], to search the Street of Silk for [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], after he [[Assassinations in the Tower of the Hand|killed their father]].

Ser [[Boros Blount]] of the [[Kingsguard]] often visits the brothels at the Street of Silk, despite his vows of chastity. [[Septon]] Raynard of the [[Most Devout]] is rumored to frequent the brothels. Some time after his ascension to the position of [[High Septon]], the [[High Sparrow]] ignores a royal summons from [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] to instead preach against sinfulness along the Street of Silk, much to Cersei's fury (both at the High Sparrow's disrespect for her authority and because she has to now deal with the brothel keepers complaining about his preaching disrupting their business).{{Bookref|AFFC|36}}
