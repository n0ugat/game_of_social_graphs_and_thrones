'''Eddie'''<ref>[http://time.com/5570839/game-of-thrones-ed-sheeran-cameo/ Now We Know What Actually Happened to Ed Sheeran's Character on Game of Thrones]</ref> is a [[man-at-arms]] in service to [[House Lannister]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Eddie was sent to [[King's Landing]], but found it to be a very unpleasant place.{{Ref|GOT701}} He was known to frequent the city's brothels.{{Ref|GOT801}} He was later sent to the Riverlands along with his comrades to keep the peace, following the [[Assassinations at the Twins]].{{Ref|GOT701}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[File:Dragonstone 14.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Eddie with Arya Stark.]]
He is sitting by a campfire with his comrades leading them in a [[For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm|song]] when [[Arya Stark|Arya]] approaches their camp. She compliments the song, which she has never heard before, and he informs her that it is a new song. The soldiers offer to share their food and wine with her and she accepts their invitation; as they share stories of their unpleasant experiences within King's Landing, Eddie comments that it was the worst place in the world. He laughs along with the others when she tells them that she is going to the city with the intention of killing [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], mistaking it for a joke.{{Ref|GOT701}}

Later, Eddie participates in the [[Battle of the Goldroad]].{{Ref|GOT801}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Eddie's fate is discussed by the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] [[Craya]] and [[Dirah]] when they and [[Marei]] are hired by [[Bronn]]. Craya says that although Eddie survived the Battle of the Goldroad, his face was burned off by [[Drogon]], leaving him without eyelids.{{Ref|GOT801}}

==Behind the scenes==
Showrunner David Benioff explained that they gave Sheeran the cameo because Arya's actress, [[Maisie Williams]], is one of his fans. Benioff said, "We knew that Maisie was a big fan of Ed Sheeran and for years we've been trying to get him on the show so we can surprise Maisie. This year we finally did it."<ref>[https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/ed-sheeran-was-cast-in-game-of-thrones-as-a-surprise-for-fan-maisie-williams-a3589541.html]</ref>

Sheeran's presence brings up a production issue: most actors aren't also trained musicians and singers, so the TV show has actually cut out several major songs that appear in the novels. For example, the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] have an important song in the books called ''The Last of the Giants'', which sums up a lot of their mental state about how their world is ending. The TV production team originally intended to have [[Ygritte]] sing it at some point, but actress [[Rose Leslie]] was so terrified of singing on-camera that she politely refused. Similarly, in Season 2, [[Sophie Turner]] said that what she was most afraid of filming that year wasn't any of Joffrey's torments, battles, or the riot scene, but the ''brief'' moment when she had to sing the [[Mother's hymn]], because she isn't a professional singer. A few actors on the show were also professional singers, specifically [[Jerome Flynn]] ([[Bronn]]) and [[Kerry Ingram]] ([[Shireen Baratheon]]), so at various points the TV show had them perform songs that other characters do in the novels. Given how reluctant actors with no singing experience are to sing on-camera, in several respects the only guaranteed way to incorporate these book-songs into the TV show is to have professional singers make cameo appearances to sing them. Indeed, in similar fashion, in Season 3, the lead Bolton soldier singing "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]" was a cameo by professional musician [[Gary Lightbody]].

Ed Sheeran deleted his Twitter account a day after this episode aired, as he was being harassed by viewers who felt it was a needless celebrity cameo. Many professional reviews argued against this, citing that it was only a minor cameo, and a cameo by a professional musician was a way to get much-missed songs from the books into the TV show. Moreover, many admonished that irate fans should take up such criticisms with the showrunners and director, not by launching personal attacks against a musician who simply responded to a request for a cameo by the producers.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/dragonstone-director-defends-ed-sheeran-casting-offers-insight-episode/ ]</ref>

The song that Ed Sheeran's character sings is from the books. A minstrel called Symon Silver Tongue came up with it to mockingly hint that he knew [[Tyrion Lannister]] was continuing his affair with the whore [[Shae]] even though his father told him to break it off, apparently hoping to blackmail him. Instead, Tyrion ordered Bronn to kill Symon, and Bronn disposed of the corpse by selling it to a pot-shop that makes [[Bowl of brown|bowls of brown]] out of "all kinds of meat." The song has added irony, as ultimately, Tyrion murdered Shae by strangling her to death with his chain of office as Hand of the King: a necklace made of stylized interlocking golden hands.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character by this name.
