'''Theo''' is a [[man-at-arms]] in service to [[House Lannister]].

==Biography==
===Background===
The soldier has a wife with whom he conceived a child before he departed for [[King's Landing]]. When he finally reached the city, he found it to be a foul and dangerous place full of treacherous people. He was sent to the [[Riverlands]] along with his comrades to keep the peace following the [[Assassinations at the Twins]].{{Ref|GOT701}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
He is sitting by a campfire with his comrades, singing a [[For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm|song]] when [[Arya Stark|Arya]] approaches their camp. They offer to share their food and wine with her and she accepts their invitation. When she tells them that she is heading to King's Landing, he warns her that the city's streets were covered in shit and pig's blood, and that the people there would skin her alive if they could make two coppers off of her hide. He tells her that his wife had just had their first baby; Arya asks if it is a boy or a girl, and he admits that he does not know, as soldiers do not receive [[raven]]s with news from home. He expresses hope that it is a girl who will look after him when he grows old, rather than a boy who would go off to fight in someone else's war. He then asks Arya why she is going to King's Landing, and laughs along with the others when she tells them that she is going with the intention of killing [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], mistaking it for a joke.{{Ref|GOT701}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are several characters whose first name is Theo, but none of them serve House Lannister.
