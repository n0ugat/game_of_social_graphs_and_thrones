'''Mikken''' was the blacksmith at [[Winterfell]]. At [[Jon Snow|Jon]]'s request, he forged the sword [[Needle]] for [[Arya Stark|Arya]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Mikken is seen in the background when [[Bran Stark|Bran]] is practicing archery while his brothers watch (particularly in the close-up shot of [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]]'s laugh). Later, Mikken assembles with the Winterfell household to receive King [[Robert Baratheon]]. He stands behind Maester [[Luwin]].{{Ref|GOT101}} Mikken forges the sword, [[Needle]], for Arya.{{Ref|GOT102}} [[Eddard Stark]] finds Arya with the sword and recognizes Mikken's maker's mark on it.{{Ref|GOT103}}

==Behind the scenes==
Mikken was played by [[Boyd Rankin]], who was an armorer and weapon smith for the series.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mikken is the blacksmith at [[Winterfell]].

Mikken is one of three people (alongside Alebelly the guard and Septon Chayle) whose deaths are foreseen by [[Jojen Reed]].

Following the [[capture of Winterfell]], it is not [[Farlen]] but Mikken who talks defiantly to [[Theon Greyjoy]], although Bran tries to hush him. [[Stygg|One of the ironborn]] beats and kills Mikken for his defiance.
