'''Ghost grass'''{{Ref|GOT102}} is a type of vegetation that exists on the continent of [[Essos]]. It is found in the [[Shadow Lands]] beyond [[Asshai]]. Ghost grass is pale in color and glows in the moonlight. It kills other types of grass.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] tells [[Daenerys Targaryen]] that ghost grass is native to the Shadow Lands. The [[Dothraki]] believe that one day ghost grass will fill the entire world, killing all other types of vegetation, and that is how the world will end.{{Ref|GOT102}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, ghost grass is described similarly as in the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]]. The map collection ''Lands of Ice and Fire'' shows ghost grass growing in vast quantities all around the mountains of the Shadow Lands, extending down to Asshai and east along the shores of the Saffron Strait, as well as northwest towards the borders of [[Yi Ti]]. The sourcebook ''World of Ice and Fire'' establishes that ghost grass is inedible, although that's all it has to say on the subject.

The books thus far have not elaborated on the nature of ghost grass, although it is suggested that it grows taller than a man on horseback. [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] tells Daenerys ghost grass has apparently started growing at a location in or near Qarth, but this is apparently used to illustrate the [[Warlocks]]' rising power rather than the culmination of Dothraki prophecy.
