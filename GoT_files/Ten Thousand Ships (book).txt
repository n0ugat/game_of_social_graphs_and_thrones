'''''Ten Thousand Ships'''''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a book about [[Nymeria]], the [[Rhoynish Wars]], and the [[Rhoynar migration]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[Septa]] [[Marlow]] assigns the book to [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] and [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] for study. They read it in the [[Red Keep]]'s [[godswood]], and Alicent quizzes Rhaenyra on key information about the [[Rhoynar]] migration. Rhaenyra later tears a page from the book and hands it to Alicent.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Rhaenyra reads the book again three years later.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

When [[Otto Hightower|Otto]] treats with Rhaenyra at the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], he presents her with the torn page, sent by Alicent to remind Rhaenyra of their happy shared childhood.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==Contents==
''Lashed together with ropes and cables, Nymeria's fleet dispersed at the coming of the first storms, sweeping them across the sea, east, west, and south into corsair infested pockets of the [[Basilisk Isles]]. Hot, humid, and [...] the true dangers of the islands [...] the pirates who ruled them and [...] demanded their toll. In the fear of [...] took her fleet reluctantly to s[...] and settled upon the peaceful [...] only to be driven back.''

''It was on the [[Summer Isles|Summer Islands]] where Nymeria next landed, on the isle of [[Abulu]]. Dour in soil, division split the refugees in two: those who chose to stay and those who dared to continue. Their voyage had been long and terrible, it must be remembered. More than a hundred ships, since its flight, had foundered and sank. Others had drifted away, never to be seen again.

==In the books==
