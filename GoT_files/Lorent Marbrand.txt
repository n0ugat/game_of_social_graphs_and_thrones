Lorent is assigned to Rhaenyra at Dragonstone when King Viserys dies. He informs Rhaenyra and Daemon of the arrival of Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]]. During Rhaenyra's labor, after she screamed Daemon's name, Lorent asks Daemon if he wants to speak with the maester, probably to know about Rhaenyra's health. Lorent and [[Steffon Darklyn]] both swear allegiance to Rhaenyra as queen when [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] threatens to have [[Caraxes]] burn them as turncloaks if they choose otherwise. They later attend the funeral of Rhaenyra's stillborn daughter [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]] and move to protect Rhaenyra when [[Erryk Cargyll]] arrives.
