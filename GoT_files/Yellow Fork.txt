The '''Yellow Fork'''{{Ref|GOT207}} is a river in the [[Westerlands]], north of [[Ashemark]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The river is the site of a [[Battle at the Yellow Fork|battle]] between [[House Stark]] and [[House Lannister]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]], resulting in the Starks' victory.{{Ref|GOT207}}

==Behind the scenes==
The location of the river is not specified. Robb's army fights there after the [[Battle of Oxcross]] and before the [[Surrender of the Crag]]. It is therefore likely to be in the northern part of the Westerlands between these two locations. Lannister scouts report that Robb's army remains north of Ashemark shortly after the battle takes place so it is likely in the northern part of the region. The three forks of the [[Trident]] are similarly named but only the [[Red Fork]] lies near the Westerlands.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no river named the Yellow Fork.
