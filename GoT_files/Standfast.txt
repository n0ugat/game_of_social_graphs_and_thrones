'''Standfast'''{{Ref|THTDB201}} is a stronghold in the [[Reach]].

==In the books==
In the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Standfast and its three villages are the last remaining dominions of [[House Osgrey]], once the rulers of the Northmarch. It is called a castle by courtesy, but is in truth closer to a towerhouse.
