{{Quote|[[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor]] himself appointed a simple-minded stonemason, believing him the [[Smith]] reborn, and when he died Baelor replaced him with an eight-year-old boy whom Baelor had seen speaking with doves that answered with the voices of the [[Seven]].|[[High Sparrow]]|Great Sept of Baelor (short)}}
This '''[[High Septon]]''' was appointed the [[High Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]] by [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Baelor I Targaryen]] following the death of the [[High Septon (stonemason)|stonemason]], as Baelor had seen him talking to doves that he believed answered with the voices of the [[Seven]].

==Biography==
===Background===
The boy was appointed the [[High Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]] by [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Baelor I Targaryen]] following the death of the [[High Septon (stonemason)|stonemason]], as Baelor had seen him talking to doves that he believed answered with the voices of the [[Seven]].{{Ref|H&L618}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] tells [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] that Baelor named a six year-old boy High Septon, because he thought the boy could work miracles.{{Ref|GOT403}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the boy was the youngest [[High Septon]] in the history of [[Westeros]]. He was said to be a street urchin or the son of a draper, and Baelor appointed him as he believed he had seen the boy perform miracles such as communicating with the gods through doves. The [[Most Devout]] had misgivings about the king's decision, but agreed to it as Baelor had done so much for the [[Faith of the Seven]]. Despite Baelor's claims that the boy was a miracle worker, he was unable to save the king's life when he fasted himself to death.
