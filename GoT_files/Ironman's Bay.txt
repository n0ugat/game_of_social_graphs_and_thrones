'''Ironman's Bay'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a large area of water off the west coast of [[Westeros]]. The bay is formed by the Flint Cliffs and [[Cape Kraken]] in the north, the [[Cape of Eagles]] to the east and the north coast of the [[Westerlands]] to the south. The coastlands of the [[North]], the [[Riverlands]] and the Westerlands all border the bay.

Most famously, the bay contains the [[Iron Islands]], and its waters are controlled by the [[Iron Fleet]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the largest ports on Ironman's Bay are [[Lordsport]] on the island of [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]] and [[Seagard]] in the Riverlands.
