The '''Qhoyne'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a river in [[Essos]]. It flows out of the [[Forest of Qohor]] south and west before it joins the massive [[Rhoyne]] at [[Dagger Lake]] (which is formed by the confluence of the two rivers). The [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Qohor]] lies on the river, near where it emerges from the Forest of Qohor.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Qhoyne is a notable river. [[Ships]] carrying minerals and trade pass south from Qohor along the river to distant [[Volantis]], although the river route is hazardous due to the presence of pirates on Dagger Lake. Qohor maintains a fleet of ships which control the river as far south as the lake.
