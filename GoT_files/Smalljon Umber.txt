Lord '''Jon Umber''', commonly called '''Smalljon Umber''', was the son of [[Greatjon Umber]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Smalljon Umber is the eldest son and heir of [[Greatjon Umber]]. Smalljon became a father to [[Ned Umber]], supposedly named after Lord [[Eddard Stark]], his former liege lord. After his father's death, he becomes the new Lord of Last Hearth and head of [[House Umber]]. During the [[War of the Five Kings]], Smalljon took in and ultimately imprisoned [[Rickon Stark]] and his guardian [[Osha]] when they arrived at Last Hearth.{{Ref|GOT603}}

Although he dislikes [[House Bolton]], he sides with [[Ramsay Bolton]] to drive out the thousands of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] that [[Jon Snow]] allowed to pass through the [[Wall]], since they have frequently harassed [[Last Hearth]] in the past.<ref name="Viewer's Guide">http://gameofthrones.com/game-of-thrones/season-6/episode-3/people/214/smalljon-umber</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:Oathbreaker 21.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Smalljon hands Osha and Rickon over to Ramsay.]]
Smalljon Umber travels to Winterfell to treat with Ramsay, requesting aid to fight the wildlings that have been let into the [[North]] by Jon. Ramsay questions his motives since the Umbers are famously loyal to [[House Stark]], but Smalljon counters that [[House Karstark]] has Stark blood, yet [[Harald Karstark]] is Ramsay's new lieutenant. Smalljon insults [[Roose Bolton|Ramsay's father]]; when Ramsay attempts to praise Roose, he interrupts him, insulting him again and correctly accuses Ramsay of [[Assassinations at Winterfell|murdering]] him, despite Ramsay's persistent claim that Roose was poisoned by his enemies.{{Ref|GOT603}}

Smalljon reveals that Jon has let a wildling army south of the Wall, which is bad news for the Umbers, as Last Hearth is further north than any other castle, and it is always the Umbers who are forced to fight the wildlings first. Smalljon freely admits that he enjoys the task, but this time, there are too many wildlings. Smalljon requests Ramsay's help, unaware that Jon actually let the wildlings through the Wall merely to keep them from falling into the hands of the coming [[White Walkers]]. Smalljon refuses to swear fealty to Ramsay, or even [[Bending the knee|kneel]]. Instead, he presents Ramsay with the captives Osha and Rickon Stark. When Ramsay asks Smalljon for proof of the boy's identity, he provides the severed head of Rickon's [[direwolf]], [[Shaggydog]].{{Ref|GOT603}}

When news of Smalljon's betrayal reaches [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] at [[Castle Black]], she declares that the Umbers "can hang".{{Ref|GOT605}}

[[File:Battle of the Bastards 12.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Smalljon leads the Umber forces into battle.]]
Smalljon, Ramsay, and Harald attend a parley with Jon, Sansa, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]], and [[Tormund]] offering terms for surrender. When Sansa asks for proof that Ramsay has Rickon, Smalljon tosses Shaggydog's head onto the ground, visibly angering Jon and Sansa. He and his soldiers later take part in the [[Battle of the Bastards]], where he watches as Ramsay leads a leashed Rickon onto the battlefield and cajoles the frightened boy to run before murdering him with an arrow. Smalljon leads the Bolton spearmen who form a wall around the Stark army. After the Stark army is surrounded by the spearmen, Smalljon climbs the wall of bodies to fight in the circle, beginning by slaying an injured soldier (presumably a member of House Mazin or House Hornwood) who was attempting to escape. He fights his way to Jon, killing several wildlings, Starks, and members of allied vassal houses, but is swept away by the crowd before they can fight.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Smalljon Death.PNG|thumb|180x180px|Smalljon is killed by Tormund.]]
He then comes face to face with Tormund, who he beats into submission with his fists and his own head, despite becoming trapped and crushed within the Stark army. Before he can finish Tormund, he is momentarily distracted by the arrival of the knights of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], giving Tormund enough time to bite into his neck, tear out part of his throat and sever his carotid artery, causing massive bleeding. Tormund subsequently stabs Smalljon to death, and his body is presumably burned after the battle on Jon's orders to prevent him returning as a wight.{{Ref|GOT609}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Smalljon is succeeded by his son Ned. At a council of Northern lords and their allies, Jon, having been declared [[King in the North]], refuses to allow the son to be punished for the sins of the father, and confirms Ned in his titles.{{Ref|GOT701}}

==Personality==
At first glance, the Smalljon seems violent, loud, and arrogant. In reality, however, he is cold and cunning, capable of unspeakable cruelty, capable of manipulating other Northern lords to do his bidding. He also harbors a deep hatred for the wildlings, which is shown to be his weakness as he misjudged their martial valor, ultimately leading to his brutal death during the Battle of the Bastards. He also seems to have an unpleasant relationship with his father, as he said that he would have killed him if he didn't die on his own.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jon Umber is portrayed in a significantly more positive light than his television counterpart. He is nicknamed "Smalljon" for the sake of differentiating him from his father Greatjon Umber. However, "Smalljon" is nicknamed to denote his younger age, not a reference to his size. He is in fact almost as large as his father and is noted to still be growing and may even end up larger than his father. There is no mentioning of any animosity between the father and the son.

In sharp contrast to the show, in the books Smalljon is fiercely loyal to the Starks.

In the books, the Smalljon is killed by Bolton men while defending [[Robb Stark]] at the [[Red Wedding]]. Due to Robb's bannermen trusting the holy bond of [[guest right]] that [[Walder Frey]] had promised, Smalljon is left unarmed at the wedding feast tables. Unlike his father, he does not drink, because he has been assigned as one of Robb's bodyguards that night. As the massacre begins, Smalljon does his best to protect Robb: he wrestles a table off its trestles and uses it to shield him, then bludgeons Ser Raymund Frey across the face with a leg of mutton. He tries to run for his swordbelt at the end of the hall, but is hit halfway through by one of the crossbowmen in the balcony who had been disguised as musicians. Smalljon falls to his knees and is beheaded by a Bolton soldier.

There is no mentioning in the novels that Smalljon had any offsprings.

===Condensation for the TV series===
Given that Smalljon wasn't introduced at the time of the Red Wedding, he was presented as alive in the TV continuity. Greatjon Umber does have other surviving sons in the novels, however, though they haven't been named, so the TV series apparently simply condensed them together. Also in the novels, after the Red Wedding, the surviving leaders of the surviving Umber forces (which consist of the elderly and the green boys) at Last Hearth are Greatjon's uncles, Mors "Crowfood" Umber and Hother "Whoresbane" Umber, who have to deal with the new Bolton rule of the North: the former, who deeply hates wildlings ever since his only daughter was kidnapped by one, joins Stannis; the latter reluctantly joins the Boltons, since his nephew is held captive, but he is by no means loyal to them. They may have also been condensed into Smalljon.

In the novels, Greatjon was taken alive as a prisoner during the Red Wedding, because as the head of one of the major noble Houses from the North, he was a valuable hostage, and he remains a prisoner at the Twins. In the TV series, Greatjon didn't appear after Season 1 due to the actor being unavailable (it isn't clear why they didn't simply recast the role, given that Greatjon wouldn't appear after Season 3 anyway). Writer [[Bryan Cogman]], however, has remarked via Twitter that Greatjon wasn't at the Red Wedding because he was off commanding other armies in the Riverlands, and he remained free and uncaptured in the TV continuity. However, he was confirmed to be deceased in Season 6, meaning that he died sometime after the events of the third season.
