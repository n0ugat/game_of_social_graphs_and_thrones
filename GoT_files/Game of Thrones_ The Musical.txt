'''''Game of Thrones: The Musical''''' is a twelve-minute sketch produced by the British rock band, Coldplay. It originally aired as part of a three-hour NBC special, bringing together different actors and musicians who used their talent to persuade people to donate to charity for Red Nose Day. The sketch features members from Coldplay participating with several actors from ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' in producing musical numbers, and is narrated by Liam Neeson.

==Synopsis==

In the satirical behind-the-scenes portions of the video, the cast's reaction towards the concept of a musical are portrayed as mixed. Iwan Rheon and Mark Addy are the only actors who turned up on the first day. While Rheon expresses surprise, Addy (as well as [[Diana Rigg]] and [[Emilia Clarke]]) denounce it as a terrible idea (and express disappointment that [[Sean Bean]] is absent). Difficulties lead to Addy leaving the set. That night, Kit Harington appears, making him and Rheon the only actors present. 

Harington calls several cast members and persuades them to participate by offering free food. Rose Leslie, Alfie Allen, Charlotte Hope, John Bradley, and Thomas Brodie-Sangster turn up the next day, and Addy reconsiders his decision and returns. 

News of the musical's success spreads and Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, and Emilia Clarke also take part, the latter of which seemingly changing her mind from her initial position and saying that she has always known that it would be a triumph. Though the musical is completed, at the end of the skit series creator George R. R. Martin appears and is so disappointed with the final product that he announces he will refuse to allow the musical to be released.
