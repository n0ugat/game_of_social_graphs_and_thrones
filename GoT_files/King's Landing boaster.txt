{{Quote|So there she is, high and mighty Queen Cersei, tits and arse jiggling in the breeze. All of a sudden, she looks my way, gives me a little smile like, "Well?". So, all right, y'know, I've never been shy and I'm blessed down south, so I put it right out. She's never seen anything like it. I mean, she's used to her brother and from what I hear, Jaime Lannister's half an inch shy of an inch. She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips. Well, you all know me, you know I wouldn't lie about this.|The drunkard boasts of [[Cersei Lannister]]|Home}}
A '''King's Landing boaster''' drunkenly boasts about flashing his penis to Queen [[Cersei Lannister]] during her walk of atonement, to the amusement of others in the tavern.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
This man drunkenly boasts about flashing his penis to [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] during her walk of atonement, to the amusement of others in the tavern. He goes so far as saying that Cersei enjoyed it and smiled at him, as he claims to be well endowed, unlike [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]].{{Ref|GOT602}}

As the man leaves the tavern to urinate against a wall, [[Gregor Clegane|Ser Gregor Clegane]] approaches him from behind. As the drunkard turns around, urinating against Gregor, the giant knight smashes his head against the wall, killing him instantly.{{Ref|GOT602}}
