His mother Movania Parkinson helped Art to secure the role of Rickon Stark after learning from a friend that the casting team had been unable to find someone to play that character. After doing a screen test, Art met the producers and the voice coach Brendan Gunn, who got him to repeat the same test.

During that interview, he also mentioned that he did not adopt a show dog like his fellow actor [[Sophie Turner]] because his family already had two dogs and his mother Movania felt that a great husky would unnerve their other dogs.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-art-parkinson_us_5730d3c3e4b016f378968aee Game of Thrones Star Art Parkinson Shoots Down Shaggydog Theory]</ref>
