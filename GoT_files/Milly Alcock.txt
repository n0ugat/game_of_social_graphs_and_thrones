==''House of the Dragon''==
Because she had never worked on a medieval period drama before, playing a noblewoman with "status and gravitas," Alcock said that in terms of Rhaenyra's physical bearing and mannerisms, the biggest reference she relied on was Cate Blanchett in ''Elizabeth: The Golden Age''.<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/article/house-of-the-dragon-milly-alcock-episode-1-interview.html ''Vulture'',] August 21, 2022</ref>

Alcock was nominated for the {{WPS|28th Critics' Choice Awards}} in the category "Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series" for her performance as Rhaenyra Targaryen.<ref>https://variety.com/2023/awards/news/critics-choice-awards-2023-winners-list-1235488828/</ref>
