==Biography==
===Background===
Humfrey Lefford is the head of [[House Lefford]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. He is a vassal of [[House Lannister]].

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Lord Humfrey meets with his liege lord, Lord [[Jason Lannister]] at the Lefford seat of [[Golden Tooth]]. Humfrey has raised five hundred men, while Jason raised a thousand [[knight]]s of his own, by his own admission seven times as many archers and [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]], along with two caged male [[Lion|lions]]. Humfrey proclaims he is ready to march to the [[Riverlands]] at Jason's command, predicting he seeks to take [[Harrenhal]] as soon as he can. Jason, instead, orders Humfrey to send a message to [[Tyland Lannister]] in [[King's Landing]] and tell him they are ready to march, as soon as Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] joins them with [[Vhagar]]. Slightly confused, Humfrey asks his liege lord what he intends to do until Aemond answers. Jason decides to stay at the Golden Tooth.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Lord Humfrey, Lord Jason, and their army march across the [[Riverlands]] as they prepare to face [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]]'s army at Harrenhal.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the elderly Lord Humfrey was a cautious and hesitant military commander. He declared for Aegon II at the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]] and was a commander in the Lannister army.
