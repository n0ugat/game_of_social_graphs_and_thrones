'''Greenseer'''{{Ref|H&L101}} is the title given to people who possess the magical ability to [[Sight|perceive]] future, past or distant events in dreams. According to legend, greenseers were much respected by the [[Children of the Forest]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, greenseers were the wise men of the Children of the Forest who had magical abilities that included power over nature and prophetic visions. While one in a thousand men is born a [[Warg|skinchanger]], one skinchanger in a thousand is born a greenseer. It is also mentioned that humans can be born greenseers just as they are born wargs.
