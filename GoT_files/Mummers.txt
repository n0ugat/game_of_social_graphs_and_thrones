'''Mummers'''{{Ref|HOTD102}} are actors, entertainers, and performers in [[Westeros]] and the [[Free Cities]].

==Overview==
Mummers can be found across the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and the [[Free Cities]]. They entertain at feasts and at [[Tournament|tournaments]], or give street performances, and some even operate at permanent playhouses. "Mummers" is a broad term, and there are in fact many sub-types of mummers which produce a wide range of entertainments: some act out short comedic skits, others give acrobatic performances or juggling tricks, many are musicians, and some act out full-length plays.  

==Mummers in Westeros==
The novels make it fairly clear that the kind of full-length, scripted stage plays that are performed in dedicated theater buildings ''do not exist'' in the Seven Kingdoms. Westeros is primarily an agricultural society, with only five settlements large enough to be called "cities": [[King's Landing]], [[Oldtown]], [[Lannisport]], [[Gulltown]], and [[White Harbor]]. In contrast, the Free Cities have highly urbanized and sophisticated cultures, which do produce theatrical plays - Westeros is considered an unsophisticated backwater compared to them.  

Specifically, in the fourth novel, [[Samwell Tarly]] and [[Gilly]] are traveling to Oldtown by sea, and along the way they stop in [[Braavos]] to change ships (this was omitted from the TV series). As they are heading to Braavos, Samwell tries to encourage Gilly by telling her about the city (which he has read about in books), and he remarks that ''"Their mummers play out written stories instead of just making up the usual farces."'' (Samwell II, ''A Feast for Crows''). This would seem to confirm that full-length scripted plays aren't really found in Westeros, though they are in the Free Cities.  

Therefore, "mummers" in the Seven Kingdoms are a simpler form of entertainers. Many are acrobats, jugglers, and other kings of [[Wikipedia:Street theatre|street performers]]. The performers hired for [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s [[Purple Wedding|wedding]] in Season 4's "[[The Lion and the Rose]]" are a good example of this: these "mummers" were not "actors", but various jugglers, stilt-walkers, and fire-breathers. Most notable of all was the troupe of dwarfs that were hired to give a mock reenactment of the [[War of the Five Kings]], dressed up as the different kings from the conflict: they weren't acting out an actual "script", but running around farcically while shouting out several jokes at the expense of the persons they were satirizing.  

Another point from the novels is that many believe that every good mummers' troupe must have a [[dwarf]] in it. With pre-modern standards of "political correctness", crowds in Westeros think it is hilarious to see dwarfs running around on stage, as if their very existence is the joke (for that matter, it is also felt that mummers' troupes in the Free Cities must have an amusing dwarf in every cast, but at least they are full-fledged "actors" who give large amounts of scripted dialogue).

Some mummers in the Seven Kingdoms actually do give "acting" performances, but they are very short, a combination of short unscripted skits they have memorized and [[Wikipedia:Improvisational theatre|improvisational theater]], the kind encountered as short side-entertainments at [[tournament]]s and fairs. There is some evidence that at least a few mummers troupes in the Seven Kingdoms actually operate out of permanent structures, though only in the five major cities, but even this is a pale shadow of the full theater scene in the Free Cities: [[Davos Seaworth]] mentions that there is a mummers' hall in [[White Harbor]] where bawdy entertainments can be had for a few pennies. Given that White Harbor is the smallest and plainest of the five cities in Westeros, such basic mummers' halls probably also exist in the other four, including King's Landing.  

These mummers' halls are not true "theaters", and at best give basic sketch shows, like real-life [[Wikipedia:Vaudeville|vaudeville]] follies and [[Wikipedia:Burlesque|classic Burlesque]] [[Wikipedia:Variety show|variety shows]]. In terms of real life Classical Theater, the few mummers' halls in the Seven Kingdoms don't put on sophisticated full-length Tragedy or Comedy productions (in the manner of Aeschylus, Aristophanes, or Seneca), but short comedic skits in the style of Roman [[Wikipedia:Satyr play|satyr plays]].

==Mummers in the Free Cities==
In contrast to the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, the [[Free Cities]] are more urbane and have a sophisticated theater culture. The heart of this seems to be [[Braavos]], with its relatively free and egalitarian society. Braavos is home to multiple rival theaters which put on full-length stage productions, scripted out beforehand, and given in permanent structures (compared to mummers in Westeros who just wander from one tournament field to the next). These theater productions in Braavos can include relatively elaborate set design, costumes, and pit musicians to match the action on stage.  

The Free Cities also do have the simpler kind of "mummers" who act out short skits or perform juggling tricks, wandering mummers' troupes that travel from one city to the next looking for venues. [[Varys]] mentions in both the books and TV series that when he was a boy he was a slave that belonged to a troupe of wandering mummers, until one day when they were in [[Myr]] his owner sold him to a sorcerer who castrated him. In the TV series, [[Lady Crane]] similarly says that her acting troupe in Braavos is going to be traveling to [[Pentos]] soon, which would seem to imply that full scale theaters exist in the other Free Cities as well (at least in the TV continuity). The novels actually haven't specified if the large theatrical scene in Braavos is actually exclusive to that city, as the other eight Free Cities haven't been explicitly mentioned as having theaters. Many of them probably do, though Braavos does seem to have the most prominent and developed theater culture.  

The novels mention the theatrical productions that mummers put on in Braavos are allowed to satirize the powerful and wealthy elites in the city, without fear of reprisal. One play that Arya sees was attended by the [[Sealord of Braavos]], and during the play an actor satirically dressed up as the Sealord got his head "pooped" on by a fake prop bird - everyone in the crowd including the actual Sealord himself thought this was hilarious. In contrast, in Westeros it is more of a ''custom'' that jesters are allowed to make what jokes and japes they want about the powerful, but it is not a formal protection. [[Ellyn Reyne]] once had a jester whipped for mocking her at [[Casterly Rock]], without legal reprisal - albeit this was widely seen as very inappropriate.  

So far in the novels, mummers and stage plays have only really been mentioned in the context of the Free Cities and the Seven Kingdoms. Some cultures such as the [[Free Folk]] beyond the Wall or the [[Dothraki]] near-certainly don't seem to have anything like wandering mummers, much less plays. Nothing is mentioned about mummers and plays in [[Slaver's Bay]] or [[Qarth]]; for all we know [[Yi Ti]] and other lands around the [[Jade Sea]] might have a thriving theatrical tradition.

==Other entertainers==
===Bards===
'''Bards''' are musicians, who perform music for money, either with instruments or their voices or both. Some have permanent positions, others wander about from one town to the next looking for feasts, weddings, or tourneys to work at.

Many mummers have at least some skill at singing and musical instruments, and many bards act out musical ballads, so there is a considerable degree of overlap between the two. Large-scale theatrical groups in the Free Cities will typically have bards in dedicated positions separate from the stage actors - the bards perform in a musicians' pit or in balconies above the main stage.  

===Fools===
Strictly speaking [[Fool|Fools]] and court jesters are not "mummers", as they permanently belong to a noble's court in Westeros instead of working for money. Often, however, they do work in association with passing mummers' troupes.    

There can be a wide variety of fools. Some are ribald court jesters, trained in singing and musical instruments, and can actually be quite witty. At the other extreme, fools are literally mentally handicapped [[halfwit]]s who are paraded around for the amusement of the audience.  

It is traditional for jesters to wear motley (patchwork), and a large number of jesters are also dwarfs.

===Puppeteers===
Some mummers in Westeros and the Free Cities even perform puppet shows. In most of Westeros these are at least basic ''[[Wikipedia:Punch and Judy|Punch and Judy]]''- style skits done with hand puppets. At the other extreme, [[Tanselle]]'s troupe from [[Dorne]] in the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]] used complex [[Wikipedia:Marionette|marionettes]] and seemed more sophisticated, acting out actual full-length plots - albeit relatively straightforward stories such as the romance of Florian and [[Jonquil]].  These are more akin to sophisticated real-life classic puppet theater such as Japanese ''[[Wikipedia:Bunraku|bunraku]]'' or Italian ''[[Wikipedia:Opera dei pupi|opera dei pupi]]''.  It is unclear how common such marionette shows are across Westeros: it may be exclusive to Dorne, a holdover from when their ancestors (the [[Rhoynar]]) lived in urbane city-states in the region of the modern Free Cities before they migrated to Westeros a thousand years ago.
