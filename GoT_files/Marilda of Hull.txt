==Biography==
===Background===
Marilda once had an affair with Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]], who is the father of her sons.{{Ref|HOTD204}}{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Marilda was a trader and ship captain from [[Hull]], a port town on [[Driftmark]]. She was pretty, small, quick, intelligent, and adventurous. For her small stature, she was nicknamed "Mouse."

She was born in [[97 AC]] in Hull, the daughter of a shipwright. At the age of 16 she gave birth to her first son Addam, and later her second son Alyn when she was barely 18. She initially refused to reveal the identity of her sons' father, but eventually claimed their father was [[Laenor Velaryon]]; they looked like him, but the claim was questionable in view of Laenor's sexual preference. Grand Maester [[Munkun]] and Septon [[Eustace]] both dutifully asserted Laenor's parentage, but the court jester Mushroom claimed the father was Corlys.

After the death of her father, Marilda sold his shipyard and began to captain a trading cog she called ''Mouse'' after herself. Her sons served on this ship and six others that she owned.
