'''Goldengrove'''{{Ref|GOT701}} is a castle in the [[Reach]], it is the seat of [[House Rowan]]. The castle is located north of Highgarden near the border of the [[Westerlands]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Goldengrove is the seat of House Rowan. In the novels, Lord Mathis Rowan is one of Lord [[Mace Tyrell]]'s closest and most trusted advisors (along with [[Paxter Redwyne]] and [[Randyll Tarly]]) and has a reputation for steadfast prudence that is known even outside the [[Reach]]. He accompanies King [[Renly Baratheon]] on his campaign. Notably, in the novels it is to him that [[Catelyn Stark]] makes the remark about Renly's followers being the '[[Knighthood|knights]] of summer', rather than Renly himself as in the TV series.

In the novels it was Mathis Rowan who sent [[Dareon]] to the [[Wall]] after finding him abed with one of his daughters.
