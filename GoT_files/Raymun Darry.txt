Lord '''Raymun Darry'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a casualty of the [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford]].

==Biography==
Lord Raymun accompanied [[Beric Dondarrion]] and a hundred men sent by [[Eddard Stark]] to kill Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] for his pillaging of the [[Riverlands]]. When the party reached the [[Mummer's Ford]] however, an [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford|ambush]] ensued, led by Ser Gregor, who killed Lord Raymun by cutting off his arm and killing his [[horse]] with a single strike of his sword.{{Ref|H&L611}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Raymun Darry was a knight of House Darry and its lord.

Raymun was present when [[Arya Stark|Arya]] was brought before King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] for punishment, following [[Nymeria (direwolf)|Nymeria]]'s attack on [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].

Raymun was later sent to [[King's Landing]] by Lord [[Hoster Tully]], to receive the king's permission to hunt down Ser Gregor Clegane due to his ravaging of the Riverlands. Eddard Stark agreed to this request and sent a party, which included Raymun, under the command of Beric Dondarrion, to hunt Ser Gregor down. Raymun was killed by Gregor in the Battle at the Mummer's Ford.

Raymun was succeeded by his minor son Lyman, who was killed during the War of the Five Kings, leaving House Darry lordless.
