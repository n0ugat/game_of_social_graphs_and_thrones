{{Quote|There are three living smiths who know how to re-work Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. He came here to King's Landing at my invitation.|[[Tywin Lannister]]|Two Swords}}
A '''Valyrian sword smith '''is the most skilled smith in the [[known world]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Established on [[Volantis]], he is the most skilled smith in the [[known world]]. He is one of only three smiths in the world who can re-work [[Valyrian steel]].{{Ref|GOT401}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
At the request of [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], he travels to [[King's Landing]], melts down [[House Stark]]'s Valyrian steel greatsword [[Ice]], and re-forges it into two smaller swords. Tywin gives [[Oathkeeper|one]] of these to [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], and the [[Widow's Wail|other]] to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].{{Ref|GOT401}}

==Behind the scenes==
The smith is played by behind-the-scenes artisan and weaponsmith Tommy Dunne, who forges the weapons used in the series.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ice is re-forged by [[Tobho Mott]] rather than a smith from Volantis. The knowledge of reworking Valyrian steel is still a closely guarded secret, but by the smiths of [[Qohor]], who number much more than three. The sword smith in the episode is not stated to be Volantene, only established there, so it's possible he could still be Qohorik.
