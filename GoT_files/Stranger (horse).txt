'''Stranger'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the warhorse of [[Sandor Clegane]]. He is apparently named after the [[Stranger]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Sandor rides Stranger along the [[Red Fork]] after he captures [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. He intends to bring her to the [[Twins]] to ransom her to [[Robb Stark|her brother]] and [[Catelyn Stark|mother]] who will be there for [[Red Wedding|Edmure's wedding]].{{Ref|GOT308}}

They encounter a [[hog farmer]]. The Hound knocks him out, then they take the wagon and make their way to the Twins with Stranger pulling the wagon.{{Ref|GOT309}} After the [massacre breaks out, Sandor and Arya escape on Stranger.{{Ref|GOT310}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After the Hound and Arya kill [[Polliver]] and his men, they ride away on two horses including Stranger.{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Stranger is a heavy courser almost as large as a destrier but much faster. He is a big handsome black stallion with a mean temper, quick to kick and bite but gentle as an old gelding with Sandor.

When [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] and her companions arrive on the Quiet Isle, they notice a huge black stallion at stable. The Elder Brother tells Brienne it is the Hound's horse, found beside the river. They changed his name to Driftwood and castrated him in attempt to improve its ill temper, but in vain; when they tried to harness him to a plow, he kicked Brother Rawney and broke his shinbone, and bit off Brother Gillam's ear.
