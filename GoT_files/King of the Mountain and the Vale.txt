{{Quote|Whilst her son circled the castle, she collected his little ringlets, her own Regent's Coronet, and the ancient Falcon Crown of Mountain and Vale which the Arryns had worn for thousands of years. Ronnel had taken to the sky as a king, but he landed as a lordling. |[[Petyr Baelish]]|House Arryn, Kings of the Vale}}
The '''King of the Mountain and the Vale'''{{Ref|H&L122}} was the ruler of the sovereign [[Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]] from the [[coming of the Andals]] until [[Aegon's Conquest]]. The first King of Mountain and Vale was Ser [[Artys Arryn]], who defeated the last [[Mountain King]] and founded [[House Arryn]], a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]'s invasion of Westeros. The boy-king [[Ronnel Arryn]] peacefully submitted his kingdom to Aegon in return for a ride on [[Visenya Targaryen]]'s [[dragon]] [[Vhagar]].
