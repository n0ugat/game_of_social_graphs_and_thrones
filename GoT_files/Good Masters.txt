{{Quote|Tell the Good Master, there's no need --|[[Daenerys Targaryen]]|Valar Dohaeris}}
The '''Good Masters''',{{Ref|GOT603}} also known as the '''Good Masters of Astapor''',{{Ref|GOT603}} were the ruling elite of the city of [[Astapor]], one of the three cities on the eastern shore of [[Slaver's Bay]], composed of [[Slavery|slave-traders]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
An Astapori slave-trader, [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]], sells [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] 8,000 [[Unsullied]] in exchange for her dragon [[Drogon]]<ref>"[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"</ref>. However, she breaks the deal and orders her newly acquired army to [[Fall of Astapor|slay the Good Masters and sack their city]]. All of the Good Masters present in the city are killed.<ref>"[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Astapor is later ruled by a [[Ruling council of Astapor|council]] installed by Daenerys; eventually they are overthrown themselves by a butcher named [[Cleon]], who declares himself to be Astapor's sovereign Monarch, and styles himself as "His Imperial Majesty".<ref>"[[First of His Name]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
The [[Wise Masters]] of [[Yunkai]] [[Siege of Astapor|lay siege]] to Astapor and reinstate slavery, and the Good Masters come back into control of the city. It is unknown if the Good Masters who currently rule are those who were simply away from the city during the sack, or if they are new Masters comprised from various slave-traders across Slaver's Bay.<ref>"[[Home]]"</ref> [[File:Good_Masters.jpg|thumb|250px|The Good Masters of Astapor.]]

==Known Good Masters==
*{[[Kraznys mo Nakloz]]}, a prominent Good Master and the representative of Astapor chosen to sell the [[Unsullied]] to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. Burned alive by [[Drogon]] during the [[fall of Astapor]].
*{[[Greizhen mo Ullhor]]}, a Good Master and a party to the deal struck to sell the Unsullied to Daenerys Targaryen. Killed during the fall of Astapor.
*[[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]], one of the Good Masters after the fall of Astapor and the retaking of the city by the slave-traders. It is unknown if he was one of the original Good Masters who survived the sack, or if he rose to the station after Yunkai conquered the city.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the other slave-master Daenerys met with Kraznys was named "Grazdan mo Ullhor" - "Grazdan" is a very popular name in Slaver's Bay, so the TV version apparently changed his name to avoid confusion.

===Known Good Masters===
*{Kraznys mo Nakloz}. Burnt to death by Drogon during the fall of Astapor
*{Grazdan mo Ullhor}. Killed by Rhakaro during the fall of Astapor
*Three other Good Masters named Grazdan. Are present at the fall of Astapor, but their fate is unknown

Yezzan is not one of the Good Masters, but one of the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

After Daenerys leaves Astapor, power in the city is seized by Cleon, a former slave who used to serve Grazdan mo Ullhor as a butcher of meat. While Daenerys wanted slavery to end in Astapor, under Cleon's vengeful rule the practice was reinstated - but with the roles reversed for both segments of the population, Cleon and his freedmen enslaving the former Good Masters.

None of the Good Masters are known to survive the destruction of Astapor by the Yunkai troops.
