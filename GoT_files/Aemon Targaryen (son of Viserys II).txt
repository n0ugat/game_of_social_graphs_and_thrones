{{Quote|Prince Aemon, the Dragonknight, may be the most famous Kingsguard who ever lived. How did he die? Defending Aegon the Unworthy from the brothers of a man whom Aegon fed to his dogs. The man's crime? Sleeping with one of the many mistresses Aegon wasn't using. And the man was one of Aegon's own Kingsguard.|[[Bronn]]|The Kingsguard - Bronn}}
Prince '''Aemon Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Aemon Targārien''}} was a [[prince]] of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] and a son of [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys II Targaryen]]. He is the namesake and great granduncle of [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Prince Aemon was called "the Dragonknight" on account of his heritage. He was raised to the [[Kingsguard]] at age 17 and eventually became [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]]. According to tradition, he was once saved from a snake pit by his cousin [[Baelor I Targaryen]], whom the snakes refused to bite. He fought and barely defeated Lord [[Cregan Stark]]. He also wielded [[Dark Sister]], the [[Valyrian steel]] sword of [[Visenya Targaryen]].{{Ref|GOT401}}

When Prince [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron]] objected to his father [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon IV]]'s plan to invade [[Dorne]], the king supposedly incited Ser [[Morgil Hastwyck]] to spread rumors that Daeron was illegitimate, born of an adulterous union between Prince Aemon and Queen [[Naerys Targaryen|Naerys]]. Aemon defended his and his sister's honor in a [[trial by combat]], killing the slanderer. The rumor persisted, however, and would serve as a justification for the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].{{Ref|H&L803}}

Aemon died defending King Aegon from the brothers of [[Terrence Toyne]], whom the king had fed to his dogs for sleeping with his mistress [[Bethany Bracken]].{{Ref|H&L412}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Aemon the Dragonknight (erroneously identified as "Aemon [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre]], called the Dragonknight") is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.{{Ref|GOT104}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Aemon the Dragonknight's deeds are recorded in the ''[[Book of Brothers]]''.{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aemon was knighted young and joined the Kingsguard at the age of seventeen. He served under five kings: His uncle [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon III Targaryen]], his cousins [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron the Young Dragon]] and [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]], his father [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys II]], and his brother [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]]. Aemon has been referred to as the noblest and greatest knight that ever lived and his skills with a sword were legendary throughout [[Westeros]].

Aemon took part in the [[conquest of Dorne]], led by his cousin and king, Daeron I. Aemon won great fame by defeating a Dornish champion, and was present several years later after a rebellion in Dorne undid Daeron's conquest, and in which Daeron himself was killed. Aemon was taken captive by the Dornish, stripped naked, and put in a cage placed above a pit filled with vipers. He was eventually saved by his cousin and new king, Baelor I.

Songs speak of his doomed love for his brother's queen, his own sister, [[Naerys Targaryen|Naerys]]. He supposedly cried when Naerys married their brother. After his brother Aegon became king, rumors started to spread that Aemon was the actual father of Aegon's son and heir, Prince [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron]]. He defended his sister when she was accused of treason by the knight Ser Morgil.

Aemon once fought [[Cregan Stark]]. Prince Aemon claimed he had never faced a finer swordsman.

Aemon once won a tourney, disguised as a mystery knight, after his brother had forbidden him from participating because he wanted to name his mistress at the time the [[queen of love and beauty]]. Aemon took part secretly under the disguise of ''The Knight of Tears,'' and was thus able to crown his sister Naerys the queen of love and beauty, in place of the king's mistress.

Despite the difficult relationship between Aemon and his brother, Aemon died honorably defending his brother and king from the [[House Toyne|brothers]] of Ser [[Terrence Toyne]], who wanted to assassinate Aegon IV in revenge for him executing Terrence for sleeping with his mistress. Aegon disrespected Aemon's memory after his death, having the gall to suggest that his son Daeron was Aemon's illegitimate son (a rumor that had been apparent for a very long time beforehand).

Maester [[Aemon]] states that he was explicitly named after Aemon the Dragonknight, the uncle of his grandfather Daeron II - though Maester Aemon notes there are those who said that the Dragonknight was actually Daeron II's own father, depending on which tale you believe.
