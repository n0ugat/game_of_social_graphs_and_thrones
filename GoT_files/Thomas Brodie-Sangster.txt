'''Thomas Brodie-Sangster''', born May 16, 1990 in London, England, UK, also credited as '''Thomas Sangster''', is an actor based in the UK.

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' he plays [[Jojen Reed]]. He was announced as a guest star in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]] at San Diego Comic-Con 2012.<ref name=ComicCon>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/Massive_Comic-Con_Casting_Reveals/ "Massive Comic-Con Casting Reveals" from Westeros.org, 13 July 2012]</ref>

He has previously appeared in ''Love Actually'' (2003 as Sam), ''Hitler: Rise of Evil'' (2003, as Young Hitler), ''Nanny McPhee'' (2005 as Simon Brown), ''Tristane and Isolde'' (2006, as Young Tristan), ''The Last Legion'' (2007, as Romulus Augustus), ''Bright Star'' (2009 as Samuel Brawne), and ''The Maze Runner ''and its sequel ''The Scorch Trials ''(2014/15 as Newt) From 2007 to 2015, he voiced the character Ferb in the Disney animated comedy ''Phineas and Ferb''.

He is the second cousin once removed of actor Hugh Grant, whom he appeared alongside with in ''Love Actually''.

Ironically, Sangster played a young Adolf Hitler in ''Hitler: Rise of Evil'' (2003), while [[Ellie Kendrick]], who plays his on-screen sister, played Anne Frank in ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' (2009).

He appeared alongside former ''Game of Thrones'' star [[Harry Lloyd]] in the ''Doctor Who'' episodes "The Family of Blood" and "Human Nature" in 2007.

He also stars in the 2015 film ''Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials'' with fellow ''Game of Thrones'' stars [[Nathalie Emmanuel]] and [[Aidan Gillen]].

Although Sangster plays the younger brother of Ellie Kendrick's character, he was born two weeks before her.

Jojen Reed dies at the end of Season 4, even though he is still alive at the end of the fifth and most current novel. He is very sick at the end and it is somewhat ''implied'' that he is dying, so this might be a case of the writers' streamlining the story because [[George R.R. Martin]] has told them what will happen in future novels. Whatever the case, Thomas himself wasn't told in advance that his character was being killed off - he first learned of it ''as he was reading the script'' for the episode.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/new-blu-ray-video-extra-game-of-thrones-fallen-roundtable/ ]</ref>
