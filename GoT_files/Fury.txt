The '''''Fury'''''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the flagship of [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s fleet. Its name is a reference to the words of [[House Baratheon]], "Ours is the Fury".<ref>"[[House Baratheon (short)|House Baratheon]]"</ref>

The ''Fury'' takes part in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], with Stannis as its captain and Ser [[Imry Florent]] as the King's first mate.<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the ''Fury'' is a formidable and swift triple-decked war galley of three hundred oars. Above her oars is a deck covered completely with [[scorpion]]s; topside she has catapults mounted fore and aft, large enough to fling barrels of burning pitch; her sails are golden with the crowned stag of House Baratheon painted on them.

Following [[Robert's Rebellion]], Stannis commanded the [[assault on Dragonstone]] from the decks of the ''Fury''.

During the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], Stannis used the ''Fury'' to sink [[Aeron Greyjoy]]'s ship ''Golden Storm'' at a [[sea battle off Fair Isle]].

Maric, Davos's fourth son, serves on board of the ''Fury'' as its oarmaster. He is killed with the majority of the crew at the battle of the Blackwater, as the ship is destroyed by [[wildfire]].
