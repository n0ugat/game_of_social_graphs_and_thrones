==Narration==
'''Theon Greyjoy''': ''When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] and his [[dragon]]s burned [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] and all his sons at [[Harrenhal]], the days when men feared the sight of [[Ironborn|our]] longships were over.''

''Aegon would not permit marauders and raiders in his [[Seven Kingdoms]]. With Harren died our empire and the [[Old Way]] that forged it. But what is dead may never die.''

''Six years after [[Robert Baratheon]] won his crown, my father, [[Balon Greyjoy]], sought to restore our ancient rights.''

''He declared the [[Iron Islands]] independent, and himself its [[King of the Iron Islands|king]] and sent the [[Iron Fleet]] in a daring [[raid on Lannisport]] where they burned the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] ships at anchor, making us unchallenged in the [[Sunset Sea]].''

''This was the seed of our undoing.''

''My eldest brother, [[Rodrik Greyjoy|Rodrik]], led a frontal [[assault on Seagard]], a town built to protect the mainland from us. After ferocious fighting beneath the city walls, he was slain by Lord [[Jason Mallister]], and his men defeated.''

''By this time, [[Stannis Baratheon]] had brought Robert's fleet around [[Westeros]] and somehow managed to trap the Iron Fleet at [[Fair Isle]], [[Sea battle off Fair Isle|smashing it]].''

''Robert's victory was now all but assured, yet we made him bleed for each island.''

''Stannis Baratheon captured [[Great Wyk]], the largest of the Iron Islands, and Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] himself subdued [[Old Wyk]]. Robert and Lord [[Eddard Stark]] led the main assault against the island of [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]].''

''They razed the town of [[Lordsport]] to the ground before Robert turned his full fury on [[House Greyjoy|our family's]] stronghold. When they breached the walls, the first through was [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]] with his ridiculous flaming sword, followed by every minor lord of [[Westeros]] hungering for glory.''

''My other brother, [[Maron Greyjoy|Maron]], was killed when the siege engines brought down a tower on his head. I was now my father's only living son and heir to the Iron Islands.''

''When my father saw that his cause was lost, he wisely conceded defeat to Robert, who otherwise would have pulled down our [[Pyke|castle]] stone by stone with us in it.''

''As my father said to me then, "No man has ever died from bending his knee. He who kneels may rise again, blade in hand. He who'll not kneel stays dead, stiff legs and all."''

''As it stands, Robert allowed my father to keep his lands and title as [[Lord of the Iron Islands]], [[King of Salt and Rock]], [[Son of the Sea Wind]], [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].''

''For a price. His last son and heir shipped off to [[Winterfell]] as an "honored guest."''

''I would eat at the Starks' table and play with the Stark children. And if my father rebelled again, Lord Eddard Stark would take his sword and cut off my head. It would be his duty.''

==Behind the scenes==
*This is the second of four shorts on the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
*According to this short (and also the shorts which Robb and Stannis narrate), the Greyjoy Rebellion occurred six years after Robert's Rebellion. While this is true in the books, it is not true in the TV continuity. The TV series added an extra two years after Robert's Rebellion so that it occurred seventeen years before the narrative begins, instead of fifteen years before as in the books.
*According to the books, [[Balon Greyjoy]] indeed once said that there is no shame in bending the knee, but he said that to [[Yara Greyjoy|his daughter]], not to Theon.

==In the books==
* The short is adapted from the following chapter of ''A Clash of Kings'':
**Chapter 11, Theon I: [[Theon Greyjoy]] recalls how his brothers [[Rodrik Greyjoy|Rodrik]] and [[Maron Greyjoy|Maron]] were killed during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
* The short is adapted from the following chapter of ''A Dance with Dragons'':
**Chapter 42, The King's Prize: [[Yara Greyjoy|A Greyjoy]] recalls that [[Balon Greyjoy]] said once there is no shame about [[Bending the knee]].
