{{Quote|It is for the Hand to find wisdom. We swore an oath of service until death.|Arryk to Erryk|The Green Council}}
Ser '''Arryk Cargyll''' was a renowned [[Knighthood|knight]], and member of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon II Targaryen]]. He previously served in the Kingsguard of [[Viserys I Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Arryk was from [[House Cargyll]], a [[noble house]] of the [[Crownlands]]. He and his twin brother [[Erryk Cargyll|Erryk]] were both named to the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]] at the age of 18.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Arryk and his brother [[Erryk Cargyll|Erryk]] attend the funeral of Queen [[Aemma Arryn]] and Prince [[Baelon Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

14 years later Arryk escorts [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] and Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] as they are walking to the king's apartments.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

6 years later Arryk stands guard at a meeting of the [[Small Council]]. Afterward his brother Erryk speaks with Alicent, who mistakes him for Arryk. The twins spar with swords in the [[Red Keep]]'s courtyard while Princes [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon|Luke]] reminisce about the past. They are both present in the [[throne room]] when Ser [[Vaemond Velaryon]] petitions the Crown about the [[Driftmark]] succession.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[File:TGC Arryk and Erryk Still 3.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Arryk searches Flea Bottom with Erryk.]]
The day after the king's death, Arryk accompanies Erryk to find the missing Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] under the orders of the [[Hand of the King]], Ser [[Otto Hightower]]. While searching at a child fighting ring in [[Flea Bottom]] that the prince is known to frequent, Erryk tries unsuccessfully to convince Arryk to defect with him, using the establishment as proof of Aegon's unfitness to rule. Arryk maintains that their Kingsguard vows obligate them to serve Aegon until death. They are interrupted by [[Jayne]], an agent of [[Mysaria]], who offers to reveal Aegon's location to them in exchange for a meeting with Otto.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

[[File:TGC Arryk & Criston.png|thumb|250px|right|Arryk crosses swords with Criston.]]
At Mysaria's meeting with Otto, Arryk and Erryk learn that Aegon is hiding in the [[Grand Sept]]. They find Aegon beneath an altar there, but are intercepted by Ser [[Criston Cole]] and Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], who were observing their meeting and have been sent to bring Aegon to Alicent rather than Otto. A fight breaks out between Arryk and Criston while Aemond pursues Aegon. Erryk abandons his brother, who is soon disarmed by Criston.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Arryk accompanies Otto to his parley with [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] at [[Dragonstone]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Arryk oversees the defenses of the [[Red Keep]]. When a [[dragon]] is sighted approaching the city, Arryk orders the castle's garrison to aim [[scorpion]]s newly mounted on the battlements skyward, and then to stand down once the approaching dragon is confirmed to be [[Vhagar]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Arryk guards King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] in the the throne room as he drinks with his friends, Ser [[Martyn Reyne]], Ser [[Leon Estermont]] and Ser [[Eddard Waters]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Arryk is a part of Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]]'s funeral procession to the [[Dragonpit]].{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Arryk is confronted by [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] [[Criston Cole]] for his dirty white cloak, and Cole demands to know where Arryk was at the time of Prince Jaehaerys's murder. Arryk replies that he was attending the King. Cole refuses to accept that explanation, prompting an angered Arryk to demand where Criston was at the time, and why [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] was not granted a sworn shield of her own. Criston ignores the accusations and accuses Arryk of sharing his [[Erryk Cargyll|twin brother]]'s sentiments. An outraged Arryk calls Criston mad, but Criston asserts the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] has been dishonored and that he must be the one to redeem it. Criston orders Arryk to infiltrate [[Dragonstone]] and kill [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]. Arryk is appalled, noting the Kingsguard are sworn not to engage in such deceptions, that Dragonstone will likely be too well-guarded to infiltrate, and that he will almost certainly die in the process, but Cole assures him he will end the [[Dance of the Dragons|war]] before it truly begins, and threatens to question his loyalty to the King if Arryk refuses.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

[[File:2x2 Erryk and Arryk Still 1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Arryk versus Erryk.]]
Arryk arrives on the island aboard a ship; his arrival is unnoticed by all save [[Mysaria]] (who had recently seen Erryk escort her from her cell after Rhaenyra released her), who raises the alarm. Arryk manages to fool the guards on the castle gates and Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]] of Rhaenyra's Queensguard that he is Erryk, and slips into Rhaenyra's private chambers. She initially mistakes him for his twin, until Arryk draws his sword and apologizes, insisting he had no choice. Before he can attack Rhaenyra, Erryk bursts in, draws his own sword and attacks his brother, initiating a brutal and savage duel which ends with Arryk's death at Erryk's hands. Erryk commits suicide immediately afterwards.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

[[File:DeadArryandErryk-203.png|thumb|right|250px|The Cargyll brothers are laid to rest on Dragonstone.]]
Arryk and Erryk are buried together on Dragonstone. [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]] calls Arryk a villain and says he sullies his brother's grave, but Rhaenyra feels that she cannot fault him for keeping his oath. At a following session of the Green Council, both [[Jasper Wylde]] and Alicent berate Criston for ordering Arryk to assassinate Rhaenyra, with Jasper calling Arryk's death a needless loss to the Kingsguard.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

==Personality==
Ser Arryk is an honorable man who tries to follow the vows of the Kingsguard as best he can, but unlike his brother he believes that the right thing to do is to serve until death, regardless of the type of person the king he serves is.

Although he is a man of honor, Ser Arryk is very committed to his duty and this means that he is willing to accept dishonorable acts if it means he must fulfill his oath even if he does not agree with what he has to do.

Despite ending up on opposite sides during the Dance of Dragons, Arryk deeply loved his brother, Ser Erryk.

==Behind the scenes==
Arryk Cargyll's character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"A member of the Kingsguard and loyal supporter of King Aegon II – despite his twin brother’s loyalty to Queen Rhaenyra."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Arryk Cargyll was also the twin brother of Ser Erryk, and both were knights in Viserys I's Kingsguard. [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] relate to their tragic death.{{Bookref|AGOT|8}}{{Bookref|ACOK|41}}

In 129 AC, following King Viserys's death, Arryk sided with Aegon II and the [[greens]], while his twin aligned himself with Rhaenyra and the [[blacks]]. Arryk and Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]] escorted Grand Maester Orwyle when he traveled to Dragonstone, in an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile Rhaenyra.

[[Olenna Tyrell]]'s personal guards (whom Olenna humorously call Left and Right, since she cannot tell them apart) are named Erryk and Arryk, perhaps named after the legendary twin Kingsguards.{{Bookref|ASOS|6}}

According to [[George R.R. Martin]], the Cargyll twins have been inspired by the twin knights of Arthurian myth, {{WPS|Sir Balin}} and Sir Balan.<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/15619/ So Spake Martin, January 28, 1999]</ref>
