'''Bobono''' is a mummer in [[Izembaro]]'s [[Braavos]]i theater [[Mummers|troupe]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Bobono is a [[dwarf]] who works as a mummer in Braavos.{{Ref|GOT605}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Bobono portrays a pastiche of [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] in ''[[The Bloody Hand]]'', a farcical account of the events leading up to the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Off-stage, Bobono verbally spars with his castmates and shares a drink with [[Lady Crane]].{{Ref|GOT605}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bobono is a mummer in Izembaro's theater troupe in Braavos.

In the fourth novel, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] offers a reward to whoever brings her Tyrion's head, or provide information about his whereabouts. Many informers come to the [[Red Keep]], claiming knowledge of Tyrion. One of them claims that he seen Tyrion in a mummer's show in Braavos, but admits it might have been another dwarf. The dwarf in question is perhaps Bobono.

Bobono harasses [[Arya Stark|Arya]] by giving her leers, offering her to come to his room, and on one occasion he gropes her chest. Arya responds by twisting his nose painfully, warning him that next time he'll lose his nose. 

While Ser [[Harys Swyft]] and his guards watch the show, Arya overhears two of the guards - one of them is Rafford, the one who murdered [[Lommy]] - arguing whether Bobono is Tyrion in disguise. Rafford says that after the show he will follow the dwarf, behead him and bring his head to Cersei; if the dwarf is not Tyrion, well, it won't be a great loss. Arya saves Bobono (although it was not her intention - she wanted to avenge Lommy's death) by luring Rafford and killing him.
