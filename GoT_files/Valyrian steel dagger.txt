{{Quote|That dagger once belonged to Aegon the Conqueror. It was Aenar's before that. And before that... it is difficult to know. Before Aegon's death, the last of the Valyrian pyromancers hid his song in the steel.|Viserys I Targaryen|King of the Narrow Sea (episode)}}
A '''Valyrian steel dagger''',{{Scriptref|HOTD101}} fashioned in [[Old Valyria]], eventually came into the possession of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] family. The blade is finely made of [[Valyrian steel]], and the hilt is made of [[dragonbone]] and [[dragonglass]].

After the [[Robert's Rebellion|fall of the Targaryens]], it was given to a [[catspaw]] to be used in an assassination attempt on [[Bran Stark]]. This weapon would indirectly begin the [[War of the Five Kings]] and, years later, also end the [[Great War]] when [[Arya Stark]] used it to kill the [[Night King]].

==History==
===Background===
The Valyrian steel dagger had its origin in [[Old Valyria]], though its precise history before it came into the possession of [[Aenar Targaryen]] is unknown.{{Ref|HOTD104}} Aenar and his family were the only [[dragonlord]]s to survive the [[Doom of Valyria]], having left to settle on the island of Dragonstone twelve years before.{{Ref|C&R01}} Over the course of the century following the Doom, the dagger passed down through Aenar's descendants, eventually to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

Prior to [[Aegon's Conquest]], Aegon had a [[Dragon dream|prophetic dream]] in which he foresaw the return of the [[White Walkers]] and the [[Great War]]. Aegon interpreted the dream as indicating that a [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] had to rule a unified Westeros to counteract the threat. After realizing the threat would not arrive in his own lifetime, he had the last of the [[Valyrian pyromancers]] incise his prophecy into the blade, only revealed in extreme heat: "From my blood will come the [[Prince That Was Promised]], and his will be [[the Song of Ice and Fire]]."{{Ref|HOTD104}}{{Note|In the episode, Rhaenyra omits the word "will" from the prophecy while reading Valyrian glyphs. [https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/dagger.pdf According to David J. Peterson], the correct translation is "From my blood ''will'' come the Prince That Was Promised."}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:KOTNS Viserys & Rhaenyra.png|thumb|Young [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] reads [[The Song of Ice and Fire|Aegon I's prophecy]] from the dagger.]]
The Valyrian steel dagger is in the possession of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]. Nine years into his reign, he clutches it as he tells [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] the secret of Aegon's [[dragon dream]] and how the dagger and the prophecy have been passed from king to heir since Aegon I's time.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Approximately four years later, Viserys places the dagger inside a brazier for [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] when he summons her to his chambers after she was caught with [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] on the [[Street of Silk]]. Rhaenyra picks up the dagger and reads aloud the revealing words, which prompts Viserys to explain its history.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

During a fiery exchange of words over the maiming of [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] in [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|Driftmark}} [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] becomes so furious that the king refuses to punish [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], that she snatches the dagger from him and attacks the boy. Rhaenyra intervenes and fights Alicent off, though she is slashed on her left forearm. The wound is deep, requiring sutures.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

While Viserys is near death in 132 AC, the dagger is placed near his bed. It emits an icy hum as Viserys dies.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

On their way to the coronation of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], Alicent presents the dagger to her son. Aegon takes hold of the blade and carefully examines it.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:2x4 Aegon II Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|Aegon with the dagger on his belt.]]
During a meeting of the [[Green Council]], Aegon plays with the dagger before stabbing it into the desk.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Once the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]] is over, Aemond approaches Aegon, and finds the dagger.{{Ref|HOTD204}} Later, while watching [[Meleys]]'s head drawn through the city on a cart, Alicent notices that Aemond carries the dagger on his belt.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
The dagger is carried by the assassin who attempted to kill Bran as he lies in a coma at [[Winterfell]], following his fall from a tower. The attempt is thwarted by Bran's mother [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], and his direwolf, [[Summer]]. Catelyn is injured by the dagger, similarly to what happened many years before to Rhaenyra, while protecting her son.

Following this incident, Catelyn shows the dagger to Maester Luwin, Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]], [[Robb Stark|Robb]], and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]. They conclude, in view of the weapon's materials (a dragonbone hilt and a Valyrian steel blade) that whoever had ordered the attack and armed the catspaw must be very wealthy. 

Catelyn resolves to carry the blade to her husband in [[King's Landing]] to investigate further.{{Ref|GOT102}} [[Varys]] and [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] both examine the blade, to which Littlefinger claims that the dagger originally belonged to him, and he lost it in a bet to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]].{{Ref|GOT103}} After he is kidnapped, Tyrion denies that, but Catelyn does not believe him.{{Ref|GOT105}}

Afterward, [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]] keeps the blade with him. During a conversation with Littlefinger, in which he tries to persuade Ned to make peace with the Lannisters, Ned disdainfully says "with the people who tried to murder my boy" and puts the dagger on the desk, to make a point. 

After betraying Ned,{{Ref|GOT107}} Littlefinger takes the blade for himself.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
At the [[Citadel]], [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] studies a book about the [[Long Night]].{{Ref|GOT701}}
[[File:Valyrian steel dagger game of thrones catspaw blade sam.png|thumb|The book [[Samwell Tarly]] reads includes the same (or a similar) dagger.]]
While reading, Sam lingers on a page detailing the use of [[dragonglass]] to decorate weapons. The page contains a drawing of the Valyrian steel dagger:

<blockquote>''The Valyrians were familiar with dragonglass long before they came to Westeros. They called it "zīrtys perzys" which translated to “frozen fire” in Valyrian and eastern tales tell of how their dragons would thaw the stone with dragonflame until it became molten and malleable. The Valyrians then used it to build their strange monuments and building without seams and joints of our modern castles.''</blockquote>

<blockquote>''When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] forged his [[Seven Kingdoms]], he and his descendants would often decorate their blades with dragonglass feeling a kinship with the stone. The royal fashion for dragonglass ornamentation soon spread throughout the Seven Kingdoms to those wealthy enough to afford it. Hilts and pommels were and are the most common decoration for dragonglass if too brittle to make a useful crossguard. Indeed, its very brittleness is what relegate it to the great houses and the most successful merchants.''</blockquote>

Littlefinger later gives the dagger to Bran. Bran, however, is now the [[Three-Eyed Raven]] and incapable of fighting on his own, so he gives the dagger to Arya, in the presence of [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]. Sansa notes that Littlefinger never gives away anything for free, and suggests that he must have some sort of ulterior motive. Later, Arya uses the dagger when sparring with [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]].{{Ref|GOT704}}

In an appropriate twist of fate, the blade is used by Arya to execute Littlefinger during [[Trial of Petyr Baelish|his trial]] for treason. During the trial, it is deduced that the dagger did in fact belong to Littlefinger all along, leaving open the possibility that he was the one who sent the catspaw to kill Bran in the first place.{{Ref|GOT707}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
[[File:GoT S08E03 AKNK.png|thumb|[[Arya Stark]] stabs the [[Night King]] with the dagger, killing him, his White Walker lieutenants and the [[Wight|wights]] attacking Winterfell. ]]
Arya uses the Valyrian steel dagger to destroy the Night King during the [[Battle of Winterfell]],  causing his [[White Walkers]] to shatter into icy fragments and the [[wight]]s serving under him to fall immediately.{{Ref|GOT803}}

The dagger is last seen at Arya's side, as her ship sails west into the unexplored waters of the [[Sunset Sea]].{{Ref|GOT806}}

==Behind the scenes==
*Although the dagger had not been seen in the series since Season 1, the cover of a June 2017 issue of Entertainment Weekly showed Arya Stark with the dagger on her belt.<ref>[http://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-valyrian-catspaw-blade-littlefinger-season-7-2017-8 BusinessInsider]</ref> This was somewhat of a spoiler that the dagger would reappear in the TV series.
*Actor [[John Bradley]] ([[Samwell Tarly]]) explained in interviews that in the Season 7 premiere, when Sam is reading a book, he was specifically instructed to linger on a detailed sketch of the Valyrian steel dagger - as this was apparently intended to remind the audience about it: "When we were shooting that scene, I was literally told 'make sure that you linger on this page.' They were shooting over my shoulder and said make sure to linger on it. Make sure we get a good shot of this page before you turn the page over."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-star-confirms-the-show-wanted-you-to-notice-something_us_596e1595e4b010d77673da05 Huffingtonpost ]</ref>
*The dagger's appearance was changed for ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', as the showrunners felt that its appearance was "too fantasy" and didn't fit with the tone of the show. In-universe, the dagger has the same hilt and handle fittings in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', but has been altered and worn over time.<ref>https://ew.com/tv/game-of-thrones-catspaw-dagger-house-of-the-dragon/</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the dagger originally belonged to [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]; it is unknown who previously owned it, and how and when Littlefinger obtained it. There is no mention of it in ''Fire & Blood''.

During the [[Tournament|tourney]] held to celebrate [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s twelfth nameday, Littlefinger lost it to [[Robert Baratheon]], not to Tyrion.{{Bookref|ACOK|55}} Later it was used by the [[catspaw]].{{Bookref|AGOT|14}}

Similarly to the show, Catelyn shows the dagger to Littlefinger and Varys.{{Bookref|AGOT|18}} Later, while discussing the dagger with the Starks, Littlefinger hands it to Ned and advises him to throw it away.{{Bookref|AGOT|20}}

Later, Ned examines the dagger, trying to figure why Tyrion or anyone else would want Bran dead. He has a strong (but incorrect) feeling that the dagger and Bran's fall have something to do with [[Assassination of Jon Arryn|Jon Arryn's murder]].{{Bookref|AGOT|30}} 

While Robert is lying near death, Ned considers what he should do. Littlefinger advises him to make peace with the Lannisters. Ned firmly refuses; to emphasize his stand, he places the dagger on the table, a reminder that the Lannisters sought to murder his son.{{Bookref|AGOT|47}} 

During the [[Massacre in the Red Keep|brawl in the throne room]], Littlefinger slides the dagger from its sheath and shoves it up under Ned's chin.{{Bookref|AGOT|49}}

Unlike in the show, Catelyn reveals to Tyrion that it was Littlefinger who told her the dagger belonged to him.{{Bookref|AGOT|31}} Later, by interrogating [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], she discovers that Littlefinger lied to her, as Jaime confirms the dagger was won by Robert; it is, however, too late to undo the damage she caused by kidnapping Tyrion.{{Bookref|ACOK|55}}

Some time after Tyrion returns to King's Landing, he chats with Littlefinger, commenting about his dagger. Littlefinger draws the dagger, glances at it casually as if he had never seen it before, then says with mischief in his eyes: "Valyrian steel, and a dragonbone hilt. A trifle plain, though. It's yours, if you would like it". Tyrion muses ''"He knows, the insolent wretch. He knows and he knows that I know, and he thinks that I cannot touch him"''.{{Bookref|ACOK|17}}

It is unknown what has become of the dagger afterwards; Littlefinger presumably still has it in possession. In ''A Storm of Swords'' it is mentioned that Littlefinger carries a dagger and uses it to cut food, but it is not specified whether it is the Valyrian steel dagger – if it is, it is certainly an ignoble use of such a material.
