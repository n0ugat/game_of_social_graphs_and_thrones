'''Daemon Blackfyre''' is the [[exile]]d head of [[House Blackfyre/A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms|House Blackfyre]].

==Biography==
Daemon Blackfyre is the third son of [[Daemon Blackfyre|Daemon the Elder]], a legitimized [[bastard]] son of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] and his cousin [[Daena Targaryen]]. He has at least three brothers: [[Aegon Blackfyre|Aegon]], [[Aemon Blackfyre|Aemon]], and [[Haegon Blackfyre|Haegon]]. After the Blackfyre defeat at the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]] and the deaths of his father and older brothers, Daemon was taken to [[Tyrosh]] by his uncle [[Aegor Rivers|Bittersteel]], where he lives with his mother [[Rohanne of Tyrosh|Rohanne]] and younger brother Haegon.{{Ref|GOT104}}

==In the books==
In the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Daemon the Younger is the third son of Daemon Blackfyre. He has the classic [[House Targaryen/A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms|Targaryen]] features of purple eyes and silver-gold hair, which falls to his collar. His two older brothers died childless, so when they were slain along with their father at the [[Battle of Redgrass Field|Battle of the Redgrass Field]], Daemon became the nominal head of House Blackfyre as it fled into exile. His friend [[Alyn Cockshaw]] wept when [[Aegor Rivers|Bittersteel]] took Daemon away.

George R.R. Martin has confirmed that Daemon is a homosexual. He apparently never fathered any children, meaning that his younger brother Haegon Blackfyre is his direct heir.
