==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[File:ArcheryTraining4x01.jpg|thumb|left|Ser Endrew oversees archery training]]
Ser Endrew oversees the archery training of new recruits of the Watch who have arrived in Castle Black along with Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] and [[Janos Slynt]].{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Endrew Tarth is summoned from the [[Shadow Tower]] to serve as the new Master-at-arms of Castle Black after Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] decides to send [[Alliser Thorne]] to [[King's Landing]].

During the [[battle for the Wall]], [[Bowen Marsh]] chases three hundred wildlings led by the Weeper to the [[Shadow Tower]], fights them at the Bridge of Skulls and defeats them, but at great cost: more than hundred brothers are killed, among them Ser Endrew.

His relation with the main branch of [[House Tarth]] is not mentioned.
