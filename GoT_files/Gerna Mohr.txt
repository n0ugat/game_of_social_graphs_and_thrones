In a cut line, one of the Children exclaims "Gernat," meaning "for the earth." Therefore it is probable that "Gerna" means "the earth" or "of the earth" and "Mohr" means "song," and that "Gerna Mohr" can be roughly translated as "song of the earth."}} also known as '''True Tongue''',<ref name="Dedalvs" /> is the [[Languages|language]] of the [[Children of the Forest]].

==Behind the scenes==
In a [https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/game-of-thrones-unaired-pilot_us_5c0af138e4b0ab8cf6934dbe February 2019 interview] with ''Huffington Post'', linguist [[David J. Peterson]] said that he developed a new, full constructed language for the Children of the Forest to speak when they appeared in [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]]. However, "for a variety of reasons" (a desire to avoid the need for subtitles during action sequences, stunt people having difficulty with their lines), they "were either cut or shortened, and all of them were turned into English." As Peterson said, "It was an idea. They tried it. It just didn’t work."

===Cut lines===
The following is a list of all Gerna Mohr lines that were cut from "[[The Door]]," as revealed by David J. Peterson.<ref name="Dedalvs" />
*"Nguwas shonji!" (Hold them back!)
*"Nyahl!" (Here!)
*"Hi!" (No!)
*"Shagukwamanji, ni-Burán!" (Protect Bran!)
*"Gi, gi, gi!" (Move, move, move!)
*"Nyahahl!" (Now!)
*"Tagungi!" (Fire!)
*"Shoguldani!" (Stop them!)
*"Gernat!" (For the Earth!)
*"Buranat!" ("For Bran!)
*"Nyagyesanks!" (This way!)
*"Magulnenya!" (Into the cave!)
*"Awahl utwommani!" (Block them off!)
*"Awassa gi!" (Go around them!)
*"Duraha toda oboldasa nyahenya. Gudniyahl ngugwa yahat todanasa ojigli." (Too many have died already. We must be ready before more invaders cross over.)
*"Ngubgukwamanjiyassa, fowanjildiyahl ngugwi." (Either we protect ourselves or we risk losing everything.)
*"Nassa durahal hafwa. Nyiha guldaniyahl ngugwa nyah." (The threat is too great. We must end this now.)

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the "True Tongue" is the language of the children of the forest. The name the children call themselves in the True Tongue means "those who sing the song of the earth."

In "''A Dance with Dragons''", when [[Bran Stark]] stays with the surviving children at [[cave of the Three-Eyed Raven|Bloodraven's cave]], he overhears them speaking the True Tongue. [[Leaf]] knows how to speak to them in the [[Common Tongue]], but some of the other children can only speak the True Tongue.

Absolutely no words or even proper names from the True Tongue have been given in the novels.
