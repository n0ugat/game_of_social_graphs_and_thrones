{{Quote|House Reed, the gatekeepers of the North, and among the most important and loyal bannermen of House Stark...I heard their oath of fealty once as a child, it's like no other lord's, ancient and dark.  They swear by earth and water, by bronze and iron - and by ice and fire.|Jon Snow|The North}}
'''House Reed'''{{Ref|H&L303}} of [[Greywater Watch]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. House Reed is the southern-most house of the [[North]]. They control the vast area of swampland and bog stretching across the narrowest part of the continent of [[Westeros]], the [[Neck]]. The Reeds and their vassals are [[Crannogmen]], a distinct offshoot of the [[First Men]] who have adapted to living in the swamps of the Neck.

House Reed's [[heraldry]] is a black [[lizard-lion]] on a grey-green field.

==History==
House Reed became rulers of the Neck after King [[Rickard Stark (son of Jon)|Rickard Stark]] killed the last [[Marsh King]],<ref name="Allegiances">"[[Northern Allegiances to House Stark]]"</ref> and have been fiercely loyal vassals of the Starks since then. Their oath of fealty is distinctive, both ancient and dark, swearing on earth and water, bronze and iron and ice and fire.<ref>"[[The North]]"</ref> During the [[coming of the Andals]], the North held out against the [[Andals]] in part due to House Reed, who fell on the invaders when they tried to pass the Neck.<ref name="Allegiances"/>

Before the [[War of the Five Kings]] began, [[Howland Reed]], the current head of House Reed, fought alongside his liege-lord [[Eddard Stark]] in [[Robert's Rebellion]] and saved his life during one of its final [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy|skirmishes]] at the [[Tower of Joy]].<ref name="E22">"[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]"</ref><ref name="E53">"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the [[crannogmen]] of the Neck are gifted and talented hunters and warriors. They have an ages-old feud with [[House Frey]], who rule the lands immediately to the south. The Reeds came to the attention of their liege lords, House Stark when Howland Reed met [[Eddard Stark]] at a [[tournament]] at [[Harrenhal]]. Howland Reed and Eddard Stark became fast friends and allies. Aside from Eddard, Howland was the only survivor of the raid at the Tower of Joy, on the occasion of [[Lyanna Stark]]'s death. The Reed stronghold at Greywater Watch is hard to find because it supposedly moves around on a floating island.
