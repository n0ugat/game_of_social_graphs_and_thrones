==History==
===Background===
House Hightower is one of the most ancient, wealthy, and powerful houses in Westeros. The Hightowers have been at the front and center of politics in Westeros for centuries, owing to their rule of [[Oldtown]], which was the biggest city in Westeros for thousands of years before the coming of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryens]]. Oldtown remains the seat of the [[High Septon]] and the center of the [[Faith of the Seven]], giving the Hightowers a strong connection with the High Septon.<ref name="Noble Houses">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFrxVMXrdGs Noble Houses | House of the Dragon (HBO)]</ref> Oldtown is also the site of the [[Citadel]] and the [[Order of Maesters]].{{Ref|HOTD101}} When the Targaryens conquered Westeros, the Hightowers, being situated in the [[Reach]], became vassals of [[House Tyrell]].

Lord [[Hobert Hightower]] was the head of House Hightower during the reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]], his son Lord [[Ormund Hightower]] ruled during the reign of King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]. Hobert's younger brother, Ser [[Otto Hightower]], served as [[Hand of the King]] to Viserys and to his own grandson and Viserys' son King [[Aegon II Targaryen]].

Prince [[Daeron Targaryen]], youngest son of [[Alicent Hightower]], was a ward of [[Hobert Hightower]] and then Hobert's son [[Ormund Hightower|Ormund]].<ref>[https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/house-of-the-dragon-finale-explained-aemond-luke-rhaenrya-daemon-season-2-1235412136/ Ryan Condal interview with Variety]</ref>
