'''Tyrek Lannister''' is the son and only child of [[Tygett Lannister]] and [[Darlessa Marbrand]], and a cousin of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]].<ref name="finalebook">[https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/season-8-episode-6-series-finale-props-song-of-ice-and-fire See] the family tree of [[House Lannister]] in Archmaester [[Ebrose]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' (as featured in "[[The Iron Throne]]")</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Tyrek is featured in the family tree of House Lannister in Archmaester [[Ebrose]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.<ref name="finalebook" /> He is not mentioned or featured elsewhere in the series.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tyrek's genealogy and his relation to the other Lannisters are the same.

Tyrek squires for [[Robert Baratheon]] alongside his cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], and is married to Lady Ermesande Hayford, an infant, in order for House Lannister to claim the lands of House Hayford. Because of his bride's young age, Tyrek's fellow squires start calling him by the mocking nickname of "Wet Nurse." After Tyrek's disappearance, Tyrion quips to himself that Ermesande might be the first woman in Westerosi history to become a widow before she's even been weaned.

Tyrek goes missing during the [[riots in King's Landing]]. [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] conducts searches for Tyrek, but in vain; his body is never found. He is presumed dead, but it is uncertain. When the castellan of House Hayford asks [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] if there is any word of Tyrek, Jaime initially responds the rioters presumably killed Tyrek and then dumped his body in the Blackwater when they realized who he was out of fear of Tywin's wrath, but he later suspects privately that Tyrek was kidnapped by [[Varys]] for the knowledge he might have about [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|Robert's death]].
