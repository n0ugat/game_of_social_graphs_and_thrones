The '''Great Shepherd'''{{Ref|GOT108}} is the deity worshiped by the [[Lhazareen]], mirroring the importance of shepherding in Lhazareen culture. Its worship is largely restricted to [[Lhazar]] itself. The worship of the Great Shepherd includes the presence of [[Godswife|godswives]], such as the ''[[maegi]]'' [[Mirri Maz Duur]].

In the religion of the Great Shepherd, all men are considered part of a single flock, thus healers devoted to this god will cure the injuries of any man, even conquering enemies.
