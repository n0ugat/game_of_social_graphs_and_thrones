A '''Mole's Town madam''' runs the [[Prostitution|brothel]] in [[Mole's Town]].

==Biography==
===Background===
She runs the [[Prostitution|brothel]] in [[Mole's Town]].{{Ref|GOT403}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
When [[Samwell Tarly]] brings [[Gilly]] and [[Sam]] to stay at the brothel, he tells the madam that Gilly will clean, cook and look after the other girls' babies. The madam offers to make Gilly into a [[Prostitution|whore]] and give Samwell some of the money she earns, but he forbids it.{{Ref|GOT403}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Gilly is never taken to Mole's Town to seek refuge, as Gilly and Sam arrive at [[Castle Black]] much later into the storyline after the [[Battle for the Wall|battle]] is over, without passing through the village, which is abandoned at that point.

The books mention three whores of Mole's Town: Zei, Lady Meliana, and Sky Blue Su. They are among the villagers who come to seek refuge at Castle Black. None of them interacts with Gilly. Since very little information is given about them, it is unknown if the madam in the TV show is based on any of them.
