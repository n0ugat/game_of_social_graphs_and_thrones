{{Quote|Our histories, they tell us that Aegon looked across the Blackwater from Dragonstone, saw a rich land ripe for the capture. But ambition alone is not what drove him to conquest. It was a dream. And just as Daenys foresaw the end of Valyria, Aegon foresaw the end of the world of men. 'Tis to begin with a terrible winter, gusting out of the distant north. Aegon saw absolute darkness riding on those winds, and whatever dwells within will destroy the world of the living.|Viserys I Targaryen|The Heirs of the Dragon}}
"'''The Song of Ice and Fire'''"{{Ref|HOTD101}} is the name [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] gave to a [[dragon dream]] he had prior to [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]].

==History==
===Background===
While ruling from [[Dragonstone]], Aegon Targaryen experienced a prophetic dream in which he foresaw the return of the [[White Walkers]] and the [[Great War]]. He took this to mean that to counter the threat, a [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen]] must unite and rule the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]].{{Ref|HOTD101}} On a [[Valyrian steel dagger]], he inscribed: "From my blood will come the [[Prince That Was Promised]], and his will be the Song of Ice and Fire."{{Ref|HOTD104}}{{Note|In the episode, Rhaenyra omits the word "will" from the prophecy. [https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/dagger.pdf According to David J. Peterson], the correct translation is "From my blood ''will'' come the Prince That Was Promised."}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
After deciding to name his daughter [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] heir to the [[Iron Throne]], King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] tells her the prophecy and makes her promise to keep it secret. According to Viserys, the secret has been passed down from king to heir since Aegon's time.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Viserys shows Rhaenyra the dagger, heated in a burning brazier, relating to its history and previous owners. Rhaenyra examines the red-hot dagger, and reads the hidden message aloud.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

Rhaenyra visits her father, whose health has severely deteriorated. She reminds him of the conversation they had about Aegon's dream; she fears that by naming her his heir, he divided the realm, instead of holding it unified against a common foe. Later, when Viserys is near death, he tells [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] (mistaking her for Rhaenyra) that Aegon's dream is true, and that she is the one who must unite the realm against the cold and the dark.{{Ref|HOTD108}} Alicent takes this to mean that he wishes for their son [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] to inherit the throne.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Rhaenyra tells [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] about "The Song of Ice and Fire," the coming war against the darkness in the North, the Conqueror's dream, that Viserys shared it with her when he named her his heir. Daemon dismisses that, stating that his brother was a slave to his omens and portents, anything to make his feckless reign appear to have purpose.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Realizing that Alicent misunderstood Viserys's last words, Rhaenyra asks whether he mentioned "The Song of Ice and Fire"; Alicent shakes her head.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

[[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]], who disapproves of the rallying of [[dragonseed]]s to master the riderless dragons, fearing that they may decide to overthrow the Targaryens and rule the Seven Kingdoms, asks his mother pointedly "Did the Conqueror's dream foretell that?"{{Ref|HOTD207}}

At [[Harrenhal]], Daemon touches the sap of a [[weirwood]] tree and experiences multiple visions of the future, including a [[White Walkers|White Walker]] leading an army of [[wight]]s. Later, Daemon informs Rhaenyra of the threat of a [[Great War|looming war]], to which Rhaenyra notes he sounds like Viserys.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
[[Archmaester]] [[Ebrose]]'s history book is titled ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.{{Ref|GOT806}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the meaning of the eponymous term "song of ice and fire" is unclear. Like in the TV-continuity, the song of ice and fire is said to belong to the prince that was promised. Prior to the release of ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', [[George R.R. Martin]] hinted in interviews that Aegon foresaw the return of the white walkers and then conquered the Seven Kingdoms, but he did not specifically link it to the song of ice and fire.

When [[Meera Reed|Meera]] and [[Jojen Reed]] swear allegiance to [[Winterfell]] and [[Bran Stark]], they swear by "ice and fire."{{Bookref|ACOK|21}}

When [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] is in the [[House of the Undying]], she has a vision of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] and [[Elia Martell|his wife]], who is nursing their infant son [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon]]. She hears Rhaegar say "He is the prince that was promised, and his is the song of ice and fire" (almost the same words inscribed on the dagger in the show) - the only place in the published novels in which the phrase has been mentioned. He then looks directly into Daenerys's eyes and says "There must be one more. The dragon has three heads";{{Bookref|ACOK|48}} this part of Rhaegar's enigmatic words has not been included in the references to the prophecy in the show.

Daenerys later asks [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] what the term "song of ice and fire" might mean, to which Jorah replies "It's no song I've ever heard."{{Bookref|ACOK|63}}

[[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Yandel]] wrote a history book titled ''The World of Ice & Fire'' (the in-universe counterpart to the real book written by Elio García and Linda Antonsson with Martin).

In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the phrase "ice and fire" is mentioned only once: [[Cregan Stark]] and [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] reached an agreement, called by Munkun as the Pact of Ice and Fire.
