The '''Bay of Seals'''{{Ref|GOT309}} is a large bay off the north-eastern coast of the continent of [[Westeros]]. It is part of the [[Shivering Sea]]. The bay runs from the [[Free Folk|wildling]] territories [[beyond the Wall]] to the [[Grey Cliffs]] north-east of [[Karhold]]. [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], the eastern-most castle on the [[Wall]], is located on the edge of the bay. The [[Night's Watch]] controls the coast southwards for 150 miles (the eastern edge of the [[Gift]]). The coast south of that is controlled by [[House Umber]]. [[House Karstark]] controls much of the southern coast of the bay.  The bay is one of the entry points for [[Free Folk|wildling]] raiding parties, as they can use it to sneak around the Wall in small boats.

The islands of [[Skane]] and [[Skagos]] (amongst others) are located in the bay.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Bay of Seals is reported as being difficult to cross in autumn, as storms make it almost impassable. Ships risk being dashed against the rocky coastline of Skagos if they are not careful.
