==History==
===Background===
According to [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]], the Great Other is also known as "the Lord of Darkness," "the Soul of Ice," and "the God of Night and Terror." His true name is forbidden to mortal tongues.<ref name="H&L" />

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After the sacrifice of [[Axell Florent]] to the fires of the [[Lord of Light]], the Red Priestess [[Melisandre]] instructs [[Shireen Baratheon]], the daughter of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Selyse Baratheon]], on their religion as Selyse believes the child is too stubborn and fears for her soul. Melisandre assures Shireen that her uncle Axell is in a better place now but the child remains unconvinced so the Red Woman tells her the [[Faith of the Seven]] and ''[[The Seven-Pointed Star]]'' is but a fable—there are only two gods, eternally at war: a god of light and love and joy, the Lord of Light, and a god of darkness, evil, and fear, the Great Other. Shireen asks whether there are seven heavens and seven hells and Melisandre claims there is only one hell: the one they are living in right then and there, the life before death.<ref name="E32" />

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Great Other is also the antithesis to R'hllor. His true name is forbidden to be said. All forces of darkness, cold, and death are believed to be only servants to the Great Other. [[Melisandre]] refers to the [[White Walkers|Others]] as the "cold children" of the Great Other.
