{{Quote|Is she the fat one?|[[Jaime Lannister]] to [[Alton Lannister]]|A Man Without Honor}}
'''Cynda Lannister''' is the mother of Ser [[Alton Lannister]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Cynda Lannister is a member of a lesser branch of [[House Lannister]] and the mother of Ser Alton Lannister.{{Ref|GOT207}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
While in the Starks' stockade, Ser Alton tells [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] that his mother is Cynda Lannister. Jaime cannot remember her, and asks if she is the fat one. Ser Alton admits that she has got a little rounder with the years. Jaime responds that there is only one fat Lannister, and he would know it, if she was. Jaime uses the reminiscences to draw Alton closer to him. He then murders Alton to facilitate an escape attempt.{{Ref|GOT207}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, there is no character named "Alton Lannister", nor that he has a mother named "Cynda Lannister". The character Cleos Frey has the role of being a captive of House Stark and delivering terms to House Lannister. Cleos Frey is the son of Ser Emmon Frey, [[Walder Frey]]'s second son, and Genna Lannister, the only sister of [[Tywin Lannister]]. His name appears to have been changed so that TV viewers would not be confused that he is on the Lannisters' side, despite House Frey officially declaring for Robb Stark.

While Alton does serve in the same role as Cleos Frey in the books, it is later made clear that he is ''not'' the son of Genna Lannister as he mentions his mother is Cynda Lannister, whom Jaime has difficulty remembering. Thus "Alton Lannister" isn't as important a familial relation as Cleos Frey is; he is not Lord Tywin's nephew and Jaime's first cousin the way Cleos is in the books. Similarly, "Cynda Lannister" does not correspond to Genna Lannister. In any case, Genna Lannister has a more important role to play in the books, memorably remarking to [[Jaime Lannister|Ser Jaime]] that, while [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] considers Jaime to be his heir, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] is truly his son.
