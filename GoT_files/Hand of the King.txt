{{Quote|What the king dreams, the Hand of the King builds. Or so say the kings, the Hands, and the lords who wish to be Hands. The lowborn put it differently: the king eats, and the Hand takes the shit.|[[Petyr Baelish]]|The Hand of the King}}
The '''Hand of the King'''{{Ref|GOT101}} or '''Hand of the Queen''',{{Ref|GOT610}} in cases of a ruling female monarch, or simply the '''Hand''',{{Ref|GOT103}} the '''King's Hand''',{{Ref|GOT103}} or the '''Queen's Hand''',{{Ref|GOT804}} is the most powerful appointed position in the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]], second only to the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|monarch]] in authority and responsibility. The Hand is the monarch's closest advisor, appointed and authorized to make decisions in their name. The Hand is the highest-ranking member of the [[Small Council]], and leads meetings of the council as proxy for the monarch when they are absent.

A hand is often used as the symbol of the Hand of the King, such as on the wax seals of letters. Hands of the King often wear a badge of office shaped like a hand, such as a brooch or a gold necklace with a repeated hand design.

During the reign of strong and able monarchs, the Hand is the chief agent for coordinating and carrying out their plans. During the reign of weak or ineffectual monarchs, the Hand is often the real power behind the throne, and the man chiefly responsible for holding the realm together. Such was the case when Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] ably served as Hand of the King for twenty years while King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] spiraled into insanity, or when Lord [[Jon Arryn]] served as Hand of the King for seventeen years under King [[Robert Baratheon]], who while an able soldier was not an able politician or statesman.

[[Otto Hightower]], Tywin Lannister, and [[Tyrion Lannister]] were the only three people known to have served non-consecutive terms as Hand. Otto served as Hand to King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] and again for [[Viserys I Targaryen]] for the first thirteen years of his reign. He was again made Hand to Viserys I for the final six years of his reign and then briefly for King [[Aegon II Targaryen]]. Tywin served as Hand to Aerys II, and then Kings [[Joffrey Baratheon]] and [[Tommen Baratheon]]. Tyrion served as an acting Hand to Joffrey, and was made the permanent Hand to Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and later King [[Bran Stark|Bran the Broken]].

On several occasions in history, a [[Grand Maester]] has also been appointed as Hand of the King, serving in both offices at once.<ref name="E42">"[[The House of Black and White]]"</ref>

Kingsguard members may concurrently serve as Hand of the King, like [[Criston Cole]] and [[Ryam Redwyne]].

The Hand of the King is formally addressed as '''Lord Hand'''{{Ref|GOT104}} and resides in the [[Tower of the Hand]] at the [[Red Keep]] along with his family and household.

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Ser [[Otto Hightower]] has been serving as Hand of the King to King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] for quite some time, and has been in the office since the days of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], following the death of the previous Hand, Prince [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]]. However, he is dismissed from office at the urging of Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]], after King Viserys concludes that Otto is being led by self-interest rather than duty.<ref name="ep4">"[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]"</ref>

After Ser Otto is dismissed, [[Lord of Harrenhal|Lord]] [[Lyonel Strong]] of [[Harrenhal]], the [[Master of Laws]], is appointed as the new Hand of the King.<ref name="ep5">"[[We Light the Way]]"</ref> He performs ably in his role for a decade, and King Viserys appreciates his advice. However, House Strong is threatened by potential scandal, as his son, Ser [[Harwin Strong]], is the biological father of Princess Rhaenyra's three sons; [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], and [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]]. Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] speaks of the rumors once more after the birth of Prince Joffrey, and Ser Harwin savagely beats Ser [[Criston Cole]] in the training yard for pitting Jacaerys against the older and stronger Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]. Because of Ser Harwin's actions, Lord Lyonel informs the king that he intends to resign his post, speaking of the troubles that his house is facing, although he cannot fully admit to the specific issues he refers to. King Viserys thus grants Lord Strong leave to escort Ser Harwin home to Harrenhal, where he will take up his role as heir to the castle. When Queen Alicent speaks of the situation to his younger son, [[Larys Strong|Larys]], and bemoaning that her father, Ser Otto, is no longer at court to promote her interests. After learning about this, Larys has the tongue of a convict cut out and has him travel to Harrenhal, starting a fire that kills both Lord Lyonel and Ser Harwin.<ref name="ep6">"[[The Princess and the Queen]]"</ref>

Larys delivers the news of his father and brother's deaths to Queen Alicent. She is horrified to learn that he has had them killed, but she responds in the affirmative when he asks if she will write to her father.<ref name="ep6"/> By the time Lady [[Laena Velaryon]]'s funeral is held on [[Driftmark]], Ser Otto has been reappointed as Hand.<ref name="Driftmark">"[[Driftmark (episode)|Driftmark]]"</ref> Due to Viserys's failing health, Otto and his daughter Alicent gain greater control of court, and six years later they are handling all matters of governance in the name of the king. Otto initially sits the [[Iron Throne]] to hear the petitions of claimant successors to [[Driftmark]], though is surprised when Viserys arrives in the throne room to settle the matter of Velaryon succession.<ref name="Tides">"[[The Lord of the Tides]]"</ref>

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] dismisses his grandfather, Ser [[Otto Hightower]], after a private argument between the two. He tells Otto that he was his [[Viserys I Targaryen|father]]'s Hand, not his, and orders him to give his badge to Ser [[Criston Cole]]. Otto tells Aegon that he will regret this, before throwing the badge onto the floor and leaving to [[Oldtown]].<ref>"[[Rhaenyra the Cruel]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Following [[Robert's Rebellion]], King [[Robert Baratheon]] appointed [[Jon Arryn]] as Hand of the King. Seventeen years later, the elderly Lord Arryn dies in [[King's Landing]]. Robert travels north to [[Winterfell]] to ask [[Eddard Stark]] to replace him. Eddard is reluctant until he receives intelligence from Jon's wife (and his own sister-in-law), [[Lysa Arryn]], that the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] family murdered Jon as part of a wider conspiracy. Eddard then accepts Robert's proposal, hoping to learn the truth about Jon's death.<ref>"[[Winter Is Coming]]"</ref> Much later, Lysa revealed that she herself poisoned Jon, under the instruction of [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], and then sent the letter falsely accusing House Lannister for the murder.<ref>"[[First of His Name]]"</ref>

On the [[Kingsroad]], Eddard is told that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] has married a [[Dothraki]] warlord, whose army may pose a potential threat to the realm. Robert suggests assassinating her, but Eddard dissuades him by noting the moral implications and pointing out that the Dothraki do not have any ships.<ref>"[[The Kingsroad]]"</ref>

[[File:Small Council.png|thumb|Lord Eddard chairs the Small Council meeting with Robert Baratheon's crested chair empty.]]
Upon arriving in King's Landing, Eddard takes up his role as King's Hand by chairing meetings of the [[Small Council]]. He learns that, despite Jon Arryn's prudence, Robert has put the realm more than six million gold crowns in debt.<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref> Eddard also hears reports that the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] is struggling to control the influx of visitors to witness the king's [[tournament]] in honor of Eddard's appointment.<ref>"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref> When Robert announces that Daenerys is pregnant and must now die, Eddard argues against the decision. When Robert orders it done anyway, Eddard resigns the Handship.<ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref>

After being injured in an altercation with [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], Eddard is reinstated by Robert on the condition he makes peace with the Lannisters. He agrees, but then learns that the Lannister bannerman [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] has been burning farms in the [[Riverlands]]. He sends Ser [[Beric Dondarrion]] and a hundred men to arrest Ser Gregor and orders that [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] present himself in King's Landing to answer for the actions of his bannerman. The other members of the Small Council consider this act rash.<ref>"[[A Golden Crown]]"</ref> As well as Hand of the King, Eddard is appointed Regent and Protector of the Realm by the dying King Robert after the latter's [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|wounding by a boar]]. However, Eddard is stripped of this position by order of Queen [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and the newly-raised King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] when he tries to expose the truth of Joffrey's birth.<ref>"[[You Win or You Die]]"</ref>

Joffrey then names Tywin, his grandfather and former Hand of the King to the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] twenty years earlier, as his new Hand.<ref>"[[The Pointy End]]"</ref> However, Tywin is too busy fighting the [[House Stark|Stark]] army under [[Robb Stark]] in the Riverlands, so sends his son [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to act in his stead. Furious at Cersei's incompetence in allowing Joffrey to execute Eddard, Tywin orders Tyrion to take the situation in the capital in hand, and if necessary, to mount heads on spikes.<ref>"[[Fire and Blood]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Upon Tyrion's arrival at King's Landing, his sister disputes his appointment as Acting Hand, but is forced to accept it.<ref>"[[The North Remembers]]"</ref> Tyrion sets about putting affairs in order. He strips Lord [[Janos Slynt]] of his lands and titles and exiles him to the [[Wall]], replacing him as Commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] with [[Bronn]].<ref>"[[The Night Lands]]"</ref> Tyrion then exposes Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] as being in Cersei's pocket and strips him of his position on the Small Council. He also forges an alliance with [[House Martell]] of [[Dorne]] by pledging Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] to their [[Trystane Martell|youngest son]] in marriage, to Cersei's fury. Tyrion also sends Littlefinger to the [[Stormlands]] to treat with [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] and make a secret offer to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], that Tyrion will release [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] (whom he does not hold) to her in return for Jaime's release.<ref>"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]"</ref>

Tyrion also attempts to restrain Joffrey's cruelty by being kind to Sansa and attempting to distract Joffrey with two prostitutes. The plan backfires when Joffrey abuses the girls to send a message to Tyrion. However, Tyrion succeeds in blackmailing his cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] into betraying Cersei and feeding him intelligence about her actions.<ref>"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref>

Tyrion attempts to mend fences with Cersei and work with her in preparing the city for [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s attack. However, Cersei refuses to talk to Tyrion, even for the city's defense, insisting that Joffrey will handle it personally. Tyrion learns from Lancel that Joffrey's plan is to use [[wildfire]] to defend the city. Tyrion heads off the plan - which could burn down the city by accident - by recruiting [[Wisdom]] [[Hallyne]] of the [[Alchemists' Guild]] to his cause. Tyrion believes that he is doing a good job as Hand, but is shocked when he sees a street protest where he is named a 'demon monkey' and blamed for Joffrey's excesses.<ref>"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"</ref>

House Martell accept Tyrion's offer of an alliance and Myrcella leaves the city for Dorne. However, after waving her off the royal party is [[Riots in King's Landing|attacked]] on the streets of King's Landing by the [[smallfolk]] of the city, who are starting to starve as food supplies to the city are interrupted by the war. Joffrey fans the flames of the riot by ordering his soldiers to kill the rioters. Tyrion, furious, slaps Joffrey and attempts to restore order.<ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref>

While sailing to attack Kings Landing in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Stannis tells [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] that should they succeed in taking the city and overthrowing Joffrey, he intends to name Davos as his Hand of the King.<ref>"[[The Prince of Winterfell]]"</ref>

Tyrion oversees the defense of King's Landing during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], using wildfire trap to destroy a significant portion of the enemy's forces. After the tide of battle turns in favor of Stannis Baratheon and morale runs low, Tyrion personally leads the city defenders into battle.<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

Tyrion is stripped of his power after Tywin arrives at King's Landing, relieving Tyrion from his position as acting Hand. In a ceremony in which Joffrey declares him [[Savior of the City]], Tywin is also proclaimed as Hand of the King. [[Varys]] notes to Tyrion that he will not be credited for his actions as Hand, but notes that those who are aware of his role are grateful for it.<ref>"[[Valar Morghulis]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Tywin, having resumed his position as Hand of the King, holds a new Small Council meeting. To emphasize his dominance, Tywin has the location of the meeting moved to a new chamber, located just outside of his own, in the [[Tower of the Hand]].<ref>"[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"</ref>

After his release from prison, Davos was named Hand of the King for Stannis.<ref>"[[Mhysa]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey is slain]],<ref>"[[The Lion and the Rose]]"</ref> his younger brother and heir, [[Tommen Baratheon]], becomes the new King and names Tywin as his Hand. Shortly afterwards, Tywin [[Assassinations in the Tower of the Hand|is killed]], leaving the position vacant.<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
During the first session of the Small Council since Tywin's death, Cersei assumes control until her son, King Tommen, appoints a new Hand of the King once he comes of age. Both [[Mace Tyrell]] and Pycelle attempt to convince Cersei to name them acting Hand until Tommen appoints his own, but she rebuffs them both.<ref name="E42"/>

After Cersei's arrest by the [[High Sparrow]], Pycelle sends word to [[Casterly Rock]] and offers the position of Hand of the King to [[Kevan Lannister]]. Kevan promptly returns to the capital to take up the affairs of the realm.<ref>"[[Hardhome (episode)|Hardhome]]"</ref>

With the death of Stannis and the end of his claim to the Iron Throne during the [[battle in the ice]], Davos's position as Hand can no longer be considered valid.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Kevan continues in the role of Hand of the King until he is killed in the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]]. His king, Tommen, commits suicide shortly thereafter. After Cersei seizes the Iron Throne for herself, [[Qyburn]] crowns her as [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen of the Andals and the First Men]] and [[Protector of the Seven Kingdoms]]. He wears the Hand brooch, suggesting he fills this role for her.

In the rechristened [[Slaver's Bay|Bay of Dragons]], [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] appoints Tyrion as her official Hand of the Queen, in recognition of his loyalty and good governance of [[Meereen]] in her absence. Daenerys presents Tyrion with a replica of the Hand brooch, apologizing that it might not be accurate as she'd never seen the original herself (it appears to be made of silver or iron instead of gold or bronze). Tyrion proudly wears the brooch as Daenerys at last launches her invasion of Westeros.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Tyrion settles in his new position as Hand to Daenerys, organising the strategics of the [[Last War]].<ref>"[[Stormborn]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Daenerys threatens to remove Tyrion as Hand of the Queen over his repeated failings after Jaime arrives at Winterfell, informing them that Cersei doesn't plan to actually send the Lannister armies north. [[Jorah Mormont]] later advises Daenerys to forgive Tyrion, however.<ref>"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"</ref>

After the [[Great War]] is won, Daenerys returns to [[Dragonstone]] with her forces shortly before the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. Daenerys informs Tyrion that his brother was captured trying to cross their lines, and warns him that his next mistake will be his last one.<ref>"[[The Bells]]"</ref>

Following the Battle of King's Landing, Daenerys orders Tyrion arrested for treason — specifically for freeing Jaime. In disgust over Daenerys burning down the city, Tyrion tears off his brooch and throws it on the ground, resigning as her Hand. He is given a trial at the council meeting at the [[Dragonpit]] after the [[assassination of Daenerys Targaryen]], where he convinces the leaders of the [[Great House]]s to elect [[Bran Stark]] as the new King. Bran promptly names Tyrion as his Hand of the King, sparing him from punishment. A few days later, Tyrion presides over the Small Council meeting held shortly after Bran's election, once again wearing the Hand brooch gifted by Daenerys.<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the position of "Hand of the King" is generally comparable to the roles of Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, and similar offices in real-life medieval monarchies. The Hand's badge of office always includes the design of a hand, though each Hand is free to develop his own specific symbol. The TV series vaguely implies that the official symbol is a brooch with a hand on it, though this might have just been Jon Arryn's personal Hand symbol, and Ned Stark simply reused it without bothering to design his own. In both the books and TV series, Tyrion Lannister also wore a gold necklace made of interlocking hands linked into a chain – in the books, this is the necklace that [[Shae]] is wearing upon her death. Hands after Ned Stark in the TV series apparently just picked up the Hand brooch from each previous Hand (that, and the TV series already made the prop, and it's a familiar visual designator for the audience).

A popular saying is, "What the King dreams, the Hand builds," but among the [[smallfolk]] and particularly during the reign of inept and weak kings, a less polite saying is, "The King eats, and the Hand takes the shit." The Hand of the King is often the one who has to clean up after the mess caused by inept kings. The TV series slightly changed this, to "The King shits, and the Hand wipes."

The events of the story are set in motion by the death of the Hand of the King, Lord [[Jon Arryn]], apparently from natural causes. King [[Robert Baratheon]] travels to [[Winterfell]] and asks Lord [[Eddard Stark]] to replace Jon. Eddard is doubtful, not wishing to travel far from his homeland and his family, but eventually agrees when an anonymous message claims that Jon Arryn was murdered. Eddard decides to agree to the King's offer so he can investigate and determine the truth of what has happened and if it poses a danger to Robert or the realm.

===Hands, past and present===
'''Under [[Aegon I Targaryen]], the Conqueror:'''
*'''Lord [[Orys Baratheon]]''', the first [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]] and rumored to be Aegon's own bastard half-brother. The title of hand derives its name from Aegon's description of Orys as “ ...My shield, my stalwart, my strong right hand.” He later resigned as Hand after losing his sword hand during the [[First Dornish War]] out of lost pride.
* '''Lord Edmyn Tully, '''the first [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]], he was one of the first lords of Westeros to swear fealty to Aegon during the Conquest. Rewarded for his loyalty with the rule of the Riverlands, Edmyn served Aegon as Hand for two years before resigning and returning to Riverrun.
* '''Ser Osmund Strong, '''a knight of House Strong, he served as Hand after Edmyn Tully's resignation and oversaw the construction of the wall around King's Landing.

'''Under [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys I Targaryen]], eldest son of Aegon I:'''
* '''Lord Alyn Stokeworth, '''appointed Hand by the new King upon his ascension to the throne. He fought to put down the rebellion of the alledged grandson of Harren the Black, Red Harren, in the Riverlands. Killed in battle.
* '''Prince [[Maegor Targaryen]]''', younger son of Aegon I. In gratitude for putting down another rebellion at the [[Eyrie]], Aenys made his brother the new Hand of the King. This ultimately led to the vigorous and ruthless Maegor being the real power behind the throne, leading the charge against those who had rebelled against his brother. Removed from the Handship when his marriage to Alys Harroway angered the Faith and Aenys tried to appease them by removing his brother from court.
* '''Septon Murmison, '''appointed Hand to appease the Faith after Maegor's scandal, Murmison nevertheless also angered the Faith when he joined in marriage Aenys's children, Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaena. Expelled from the Faith, he could do little as [[Faith Militant uprising|the lords and knights of the realm rose up under the banner of the Seven]]. He was later murdered by members of the [[Faith Militant]].
'''Under [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor I Targaryen]], the Cruel:'''
* '''Lord Lucas Harroway''', the King's goodfather, he was appointed Hand upon Maegor's ascension. However, when his daughter failed to deliver a healthy child to the King, he was executed along with the rest of his family.
* '''Lord Edwell Celtigar''', appointed Hand after the execution of Lord Harroway.
'''Under [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], the Old King:'''
* '''Lord Rogar Baratheon, '''the grandson of Orys Baratheon, he was the first to openly declare for Prince Jaehaerys's claim against that of his uncle, Maegor. Appointed Lord Protector of the Realm and Hand of the King upon Jaehaerys's ascension to the throne, Rogar shared the rule of the realm with Dowager Queen Alyssa, who he married a year later.
* '''Septon [[Barth]]''', the King's closest friend and an unconventional septon, he helped Jaehaerys rule the Kingdoms for near forty years. Died in office.
* '''Ser [[Ryam Redwyne]]''', the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, he was a brilliant warrior but a poor Hand and quickly left the office.
* '''Prince Baelon Targaryen, '''the Old King's second son and Prince of Dragonstone after the death of his older brother Aemon, Baelon's tenure as the Hand of the King is remembered fondly. Died in office.
* '''Ser [[Otto Hightower]]''', the younger brother of Lord Hightower of Oldtown, Ser Otto was a learned man who effectively ruled the Seven Kingdoms during the last years of the Old King's rule.
'''Under [[Viserys I Targaryen]], the Young King:'''
* '''Ser [[Otto Hightower]]''', reappointed to his office by King Viserys, serving as his Hand for the first 6 years of Viserys's reign. He orchestrated the marriage of his daughter, [[Alicent Hightower]] to Viserys as his second wife following the death Queen [[Aemma Arryn]]. Dismissed as Hand by Viserys after repeatedly "hectoring" the King to replace Rhaenyra with Aegon as his heir.
* '''Lord [[Lyonel Strong]]''', Head of House Strong and Lord of Harrenhal, Lord Lyonel was appointed as Viserys second Hand following the dismissal of Otto Hightower. Lyonel dutifully served Viserys for 11 years before his death from a fire in Harrenhal.
* '''Ser Otto Hightower''', Ser Otto was reappointed to a second term as Hand following Lord Lyonel's untimely demise. Serving for the final nine years of Viserys reign, Otto clandestinely plotted with allies to supplant Viserys's designated heir, Princess Rhaenyra, with Viserys's eldest son and his grandson, Prince Aegon, in the line of succession. To that end, he gradually stacked the small council with his allies. By the final year of Viserys's reign, Otto was effectively leading a regency as Viserys was too ill to rule.
'''Under [[Aegon II Targaryen]]:'''
* '''Ser [[Otto Hightower]]''', following Visery's death, Otto orchestrated Aegon's succession to the Iron Throne, where he continued to serve as his Hand. Otto navigated the Greens through the early Dance of the Dragons, consolidating and expanding their power base by securing the allegiance of several noble houses via diplomacy and avoiding bloodshed as much as possible with their adversary in the Dance, the Blacks.
* '''Ser [[Criston Cole]]''', Ser Criston was Lord Commander of his Kingsguard upon Aegon II's ascension to the throne. He became Hand, following Otto's second dismissal as Hand by Aegon II.
'''Under [[Daeron I Targaryen]], the Young Dragon:'''
* '''Prince Viserys Targaryen, ''' widely seen as having been the one to truly rule the Seven Kingdoms while Daeron tried to conquer Dorne.
'''Under [[Baelor I Targaryen]], the Blessed King:'''
* '''Prince Viserys Targaryen''', continued as Hand after the death of Daeron in Dorne. The true power behind the throne yet again, he was said to govern while his nephew prayed. The embarrassments Baelor caused the realm in the form of his appointments to High Septon (a man who couldn't read a sermon and a boy of eight) and their deaths led to the smallfolk believing that Viserys had poisoned them. He was also accused of having poisoned Baelor himself to end his madness and ascend to the throne.
'''Under [[Daeron II Targaryen]], the Good King:'''
* '''Prince [[Baelor Targaryen|Baelor 'Breakspear' Targaryen]], '''appointed Hand by his father after serving with distinction during the Blackfyre Rebellion. He is remembered as a great man and a good Hand. Killed in office during a Trial by Seven by his own brother Prince Maekar.
'''Under [[Aerys Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Aerys I Targaryen]]:'''
* '''Ser [[Brynden Rivers|Brynden 'Bloodraven' Rivers]], '''made Hand and king in all but name during his nephew's rule. Having previously served on the Small Council, he had built an important network of spies in all Seven Kingdoms. His abilities as spymaster and a warrior allowed him to deal with the remaining threat of the Blackfyres. Accused by many of having killed Daeron the Good during the Great Spring Sickness.
'''Under [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar I Targaryen]]:'''
* '''Ser Brynden 'Bloodraven' Rivers, '''continued as Hand after the death of Aerys. After the King's death, he elected to call a Great Council to debate the matter of succession. Crushed another attempted Blackfyre Rebellion by murdering Aenys Blackfyre.
'''Under [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V Targaryen]]:'''
* '''Ser Brynden 'Bloodraven' Rivers, '''arrested upon the King's ascension for the murder of Aenys Blackfyre. He chose exile to the [[Night's Watch]] over execution.
'''Under [[Aerys II Targaryen]], the Mad King:'''
* '''Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]''', the King's Hand for twenty years, resigned after King Aerys snubbed the idea of a marriage between his son [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] and Tywin's daughter Cersei. Tywin's resignation caused Aerys to spiral even further into the heights of paranoia and insanity. Following Tywin's resignation, Aerys appointed four new Hands in rapid succession, the last three within the space of a year during [[Robert's Rebellion]].
* '''Lord [[Owen Merryweather]]''', served as Hand for the brief few years between Tywin's resignation and the beginning of Robert's Rebellion. An amiable sycophant, he failed to take any action during the early days of the rebellion, which allowed Ned Stark and Robert Baratheon to successfully flee to their holdings and raise their armies in open warfare. For this blunder, Aerys had him exiled and his lands seized.
* '''Lord [[Jon Connington]]''', served as Hand for King Aerys II. He was appointed after Merryweather's exile because he was a close friend of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Prince Rhaegar]] and Aerys wanted a young, vigorous and skilled warrior to match Robert. Aerys exiled him after being defeated at the [[Battle of the Bells]] during Robert's Rebellion. It is rumored that he drank himself to death after being expelled from the [[Golden Company]] for apparently stealing from the company paychest, but in the fifth novel he is revealed to be alive, having faked his own death with the connivance of [[Varys]].
* '''Lord [[Qarlton Chelsted]]''', executed for treason. Chelsted only briefly served as Hand between the Battle of the Bells and two weeks before the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. Aerys ordered Chelsted executed because he tried to dissuade the Mad King of [[Wildfire plot|his diabolic plan to destroy the whole city by wildfire]], and resigned his position in protest when he realized Aerys wouldn't back down. People who weren't in the capital at the time often forget that Chelsted and his successor Rossart were ever Hands.
* '''Lord [[Rossart]]''', a [[Wisdom]] of the [[Alchemists' Guild]]. He was Hand for less than a fortnight, before he was killed by [[Jaime Lannister]] during the [[Sack of King's Landing]].

'''Under [[Robert Baratheon]], the Usurper:'''
* '''Lord [[Jon Arryn]]''', for King Robert. Served as Hand for most of the seventeen years of Robert's reign. Lord Arryn was said to be essentially the one man really holding the realm together while Robert drank, ate, and whored.
* '''Lord [[Eddard Stark]]''', for King [[Robert Baratheon]]. Served briefly during the final months of Robert's reign.

'''Under [[Joffrey Baratheon]]:'''
* '''Lord [[Tyrion Lannister]]''', serving as Acting Hand of the King in place of his father [[Tywin Lannister]].
* '''Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]''', relieved Tyrion Lannister from his post as Acting Hand of the King after the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

'''Under [[Tommen Baratheon]]:'''
* '''Lord Tywin Lannister''', continued his role as Hand of the King for Tommen after Joffrey's death at the [[Purple Wedding]].
* '''Ser [[Harys Swyft]]''', specifically picked by Cersei because he is weak-willed and will do as she bids (Jaime Lannister considers Ser Harys a "toad") and, as Kevan Lannister's father-in-law, he would also be a hostage for her uncle's good behavior. Cersei later demoted him to Lord Treasurer.
* '''Orton Merryweather''', another of the lickspittles Cersei appointed to Tommen's Small Council. He and his wife Taena fled the capital after Cersei's arrest.
* '''Lord [[Mace Tyrell]],''' appointed by Kevan Lannister to ease tensions between Houses Lannister and Tyrell in the wake of Cersei and Margaery's arrests by the Faith.

During the brief period in which [[Renly Baratheon]] rebelled and laid claimed to the [[Iron Throne]] he named Lord [[Mace Tyrell]] - father of his new wife [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] and his lover Ser [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] - as his Hand of the King. The TV series made no mention of Mace's appointment.

While Daenerys rules Meereen, she does not appoint anyone as her Hand. Following her departure, her loyalists form a ruling council to oversee Meereen till she returns, and Ser Barristan Selmy is appointed to be the Queen's Hand. Selmy is reluctant to accept that office, perhaps because it was not Daenerys who appointed him, but he officiates as the Hand because he knows ''someone'' must take charge under the current circumstances - the city is surrounded by enemies.

Neither [[Robb Stark]] of the [[North]] nor [[Balon Greyjoy]] of the [[Iron Islands]] appoint their own "Hand of the King" because they are each fighting to secede their respective regions and set them up as independent kingdoms, both of which had no traditional office of a "Hand of the King" as it is particular to the government of the [[Iron Throne]] itself. During the Kingsmoot that follows Balon Greyjoy's death, [[Yara Greyjoy|Asha Greyjoy]] tells her uncle Victarion that she will support him as king if he names her his Hand, but he rejects her offer.

In the books, [[Stannis Baratheon]] names [[Davos Seaworth]] his new Hand of the King after his release from the dungeons of Dragonstone, after it is discovered that his current Hand, Alester Florent (uncle of his own wife [[Selyse Baratheon]]) was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Lannisters after the defeat of Stannis' army at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Alester wrote a letter he planned to send to Lord Tywin - without Stannis' knowledge or consent - offering peace and suggesting that Stannis would give up his claim to the Iron Throne, swear fealty to Joffrey, and take back his denouncement of Joffrey's parentage, but would remain Lord of Dragonstone and Storm's End, and that the Florents would get their castle, Brightwater Keep, back. In addition, he offered [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]]'s hand in marriage to [[Tommen Baratheon]]. Alester had no intention of treason, but innocently felt he was doing what was best for Stannis, because these were the best terms he could hope for after his loss at the Blackwater. However, Stannis was unwilling to even negotiate with his enemies, but offering to marry off his only child to the Lannisters was an even greater insult - particularly given that he considers Tommen to be an abomination born of [[incest]]. Alester is thrown in the dungeon as well and during his brief time as Davos' cellmate explains what transpired. Although Alester acted of folly and had no malicious intent, Stannis - harsh in his judgment as ever - believes that Alester feigned loyalty while acting against him, while Davos, out of earnest loyalty, told him hard truths he didn't want to hear, so he releases Davos and promotes him to be his new Hand of the King - to the consternation of some of his other remaining bannermen from more prestigious noble Houses.

In the TV series, during the episode "Blackwater," Stannis says he intends to name Davos as his Hand after they win the battle, but they lose the battle, Davos is lost at sea, and when he returns, he quarrels with Melisandre and is thrown in the dungeon. Thus there was never a point when he could have actively assumed the office. However, in the Season 3 finale "Mhysa," after Davos is released from the dungeon, he starts reading through letters the castle has received (despite his difficulty from only recently learning how to read), and tells [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]] that he has to do this drudgery now that he is her father's Hand "again" - which doesn't match the previous order of events in the TV series, in which Stannis intended to name Davos his Hand but never had the chance before. It's possible Davos was just speaking loosely about Stannis' earlier intent to promote him, generally referring to being back in her father's service now that he's out of the dungeon. Either way, Davos is Stannis's Hand after he is released from Dragonstone's dungeons.

Jon Connington, the guardian of the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia, styles himself "Hand of the True King", although Aegon has not been crowned yet.
