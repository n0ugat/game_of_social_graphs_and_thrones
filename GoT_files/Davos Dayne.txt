{{Quote|After [[Mors Martell|Mors]] fell in battle, [[Nymeria]] took command of his armies and united [[Dorne]] - in two years. She ruled for twenty-seven more, and though she married again, those husbands were little more than counselors and consorts; Dorne was Nymeria and Nymeria was Dorne.|[[Ellaria Sand]]|Dorne (short)}}
Lord '''Davos Dayne'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the third husband of Princess [[Nymeria]].

==Biography==
Davos was the heir of King [[Vorian Dayne]], who was sent to the [[Wall]] after being defeated by Nymeria, who took Davos himself as her husband.{{Ref|H&L613}} Although Davos was the husband, it was the Princess herself who held the true power between the two of them, with Davos being little more than a counselor and consort. The son they had did not succeed Nymeria, as the Dornish rules of succession are gender-neutral.{{Ref|H&L509}}

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Davos Dayne's biography is about the same, except some details: he was not Vorian's heir and he was Nymeria's third husband (the second was Lord Uller).
