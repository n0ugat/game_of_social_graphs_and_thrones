'''Ash'''<ref>[http://dedalvs.tumblr.com/post/144459011173/dothraki-and-valyrian-dialogue-episode-604-of Dothraki and Valyrian dialogue 6x04 Game of Thrones]</ref> is one of the former slaves of [[Meereen]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Ash, along with [[Kesh]], is one of the prominent Meereenese freedmen that meet with [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] after his negotiations with the Masters from [[Astapor]], [[Yunkai]], and [[Volantis]]. He is concerned about Tyrion, a stranger, negotiating in the name of [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and expresses his distrust for Tyrion. He accusingly asks [[Grey Worm]] how he can dine with the people who mistreated them, and Grey Worm answers that if there is a chance for peace - they should take it.{{Ref|GOT604}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the only character named Ash is one of the [[Children of the Forest]]. Prominent freedmen include Mollono Dos Yob and Symon Stripeback, though the two are prominent loyalists to Daenerys's regime and members of the ruling council following her departure from the city.
