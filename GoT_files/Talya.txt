'''Talya''' was a [[Handmaiden|lady-in-waiting]] to Queen [[Alicent Hightower]] and a spy in [[Mysaria]]'s employ.

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
When [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] is brought before Alicent shortly after giving birth to [[Joffrey Velaryon]], Alicent tells Talya to fetch Rhaenyra a cushion. She later walks in on a conversation between Alicent and [[Larys Strong]], but is quickly sent out.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Talya secretly meets Mysaria and delivers her information regarding the recent events:  royal audience to decide the succession of [[House Velaryon]], the last supper of King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]], the factions of the royal family, and the subsequent fight between Rhaenyra's sons and Alicent's sons.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[Jon]] informs Talya about the recent death of King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]. In turn, she quickly informs Queen Alicent. In the following hours, Talya, along with other servants, are imprisoned at the command of Ser [[Otto Hightower]], in order to prevent the news of Viserys's death and the plans of the [[Green Council]] to crown Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] from spreading and reaching Rhaenyra on [[Dragonstone]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

In exchange for a sexual favor, Larys informs Alicent that Talya is one of Mysaria's spies.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Larys informs Alicent that all imprisoned servants were questioned, and those found guilty of espionage were executed.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

==Behind the scenes==
Talya is portrayed by [[Alexis Raben]], a producer on the show and the wife of [[Miguel Sapochnik]].

==In the books==
