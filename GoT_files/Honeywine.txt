The '''Honeywine'''{{Ref|H&L107}} is a river in the [[Reach]], in south-western [[Westeros]]. The Honeywine flows into the [[Redwyne Straits]] via Whispering Sound. The great city of [[Oldtown]] is located at its mouth.<ref>"[[The Order of the Maesters]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Honeywine is noted as being one of the agricultural centers of the Reach. The river divides the city of Oldtown in half, with the [[Citadel]] located along its banks. The river is pleasant, with [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] and their acolytes known to frequent the inns and other establishments along its banks. Further upriver, the Honeywine flows past [[Honeyholt]], before it finds its source in hills just north of [[Brightwater Keep]], the seat of [[House Florent]].
