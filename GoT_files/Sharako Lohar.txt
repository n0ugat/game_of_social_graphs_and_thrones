'''Sharako Lohar''' is a [[Lys]]eni serving as a commander of the [[Triarchy]] fleet.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==Biography==
Sharako is an eccentric but highly skilled admiral in the Triarchy's fleet. Sharako was born biologically female but essentially lives as a man, and has multiple wives. The leaders of the Triarchy couldn't quite understand how a woman could behave masculinely, so they just refer to Sharako as a man (using he/him pronouns).

[[Tyland Lannister]] negotiates with the [[Triarchy]] for their fleet to help break the [[House Velaryon|Velaryon]] shipping [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]]. They agree but demand control over the [[Stepstones]]. Additionally, Admiral Lohar challenges Tyland to a mud-wrestling match before agreeing to sail with him. Tyland wins, earning Lohar's respect, and they set sail for [[Westeros]] with the Triarchy's fleet. But Sharako declares, that she wants to have children with Tyland.

==Behind the scenes==
Sharako Lohar's character description reads as follows:
:''"An eccentric Lysene commander of the Triarchy fleet."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Lohar was a Lysene admiral who commanded a combined Triarchy fleet of 90 [[Myr]]ish, Lysene, and [[Tyrosh]]i warships.{{Bookref|F&B|15}}

Lohar is only referred to by name in four lines of the book, and was given no physical description whatsoever.

In the condensed prequel novella ''The Princess and the Queen'', Sharako was only referred to in two lines - which were worded in such a way that Sharako's gender wasn't even clear (only describing "the fleet commanded by Sharako Lohar" without using pronouns). The full version of ''Fire & Blood'' only contained one more brief reference to Sharako in a later chapter - two lines in the same paragraph - which didn't give any further description or background (except tacitly referring to Sharako as "he," confirming Sharako was male).

The TV-version of Sharako is not just a renamed version of [[Racallio Ryndoon]], but recombines several elements from Racallio in the books. Whereas Racallio in the books was born biologically male but often exhibits feminine traits (often referred to as "Queen Racallio"), TV-Sharako was born biologically female but often exhibits masculine traits, and Sharako's superiors use masculine pronouns to refer to the character. Essentially, in modern terms Book-Racallio has some aspects of a trans woman, while TV-Sharako has some aspects of a trans man - but these are not terms that exist in their medieval setting.

There are some different cultures in Essos that do believe that gender is based on social roles and not biology, for example the Moonsinger religion which can be found in the Free Cities believes that a female who behaves like a man and performs the social functions of a man (such as a warrior) by definition ''is'' a "man"; similarly, because their priesthood is all-female, any biological male who wishes to become a priest can do so, but must live ''as'' a "woman" and by definition "is" a woman.
