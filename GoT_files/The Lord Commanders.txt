==Premise==
{{Premise|H&L507}}

==Narration==
'''Alliser Thorne''': ''Each brother of the [[Night's Watch]] swears a sacred oath to protect the realms of men.''

''That doesn't mean pissing about, waiting for the cold to finally put an end to you. It means bleeding. It means fighting. It means going [[Beyond the Wall|beyond]] the [[Wall]] and hunting down those who mean harm to the [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]].''

''So how do you get a thousand rapists and thieves to fight together, to bleed together?''

''That's the burden of the [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]]. He keeps the [[Builder|builders]] building, the [[Ranger|rangers]] ranging, and the [[Steward (Night's Watch)|stewards]] stewarding, or else it all falls apart.''

''Each Lord Commander is chosen from and by his fellow brothers, and he serves for life.''

''A long time ago, you may have had men from [[Queensgate]] and [[Long Barrow]] and the other sixteen castles of the Wall come to [[Castle Black]] for an [[Elections#Night's Watch|election]].''

''These days, you'd be lucky to scrape a few dozen from [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea|Eastwatch]] and the [[Shadow Tower]], or however many they can spare, who cast votes in their stead.''

''All the same, the brothers are allowed to name whomever they think worthy of the title. Then, we vote until one man receives a majority, however long it takes.''

''Some elections have lasted an hour; some have lasted weeks. One even lasted two years.''

''[[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] has said there have been nine hundred and ninety-seven Lord Commanders since the Night's Watch was founded.''

''Back then, we had true soldiers, men of honor and strength. Now, look who mans the wall. [[Jon Snow|Bastards]], peasants who stole a sheep to bugger, and [[Samwell Tarly|fat little nobles who weren't worthy of their lord father's land]].''

''But the Lord Commander must find a place for them all, and turn these walking piles of horse dung into soldiers of the Night's Watch.''

''Though, we haven't always been so lucky to have such men lead us. We've had cowards and fools as well, our tyrants and our madmen.''

''[[Runcel Hightower]] tried to bequeath the Watch to his [[bastard]]. [[Rodrik Flint]] thought to make himself [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]. [[Tristan Mudd]], [[Marq Rankenfell|Mad Marq Rankenfell]], [[Robin Hill]], each nearly destroyed us with their foolishness.''

''Six hundred years ago, the commanders at Snowgate and the [[Nightfort]] even went to war against each other. The simpering Lord Commander asked them politely to lay aside their quarrel, and incredibly, they did because they joined forces to murder him.''

''The [[House Stark|Stark]] in [[Winterfell]] had to intervene and take both their heads to save the Night's Watch.''

''Now, we've got more mouths than we can feed, a [[Stannis Baratheon|southern king]] in [[Castle Black|our castle]], and [[Battle for the Wall|cells full of wildlings]], and no Lord Commander, since the [[Jeor Mormont|last]] was [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|betrayed by his own men]].''

''We need a new leader, a man respected enough to hold the Watch together in this dark hour. A leader strong enough to make sure the Night's Watch survives the coming winter, no matter the cost.''
