{{Quote|Fresh news from Stone Hedge. The Blackwoods have overwhelmed the Brackens, and Lord Amos has pledged his banner to you. House Bracken is yours.|[[Simon Strong]] to [[Daemon Targaryen]]|Regent (episode)}}
The '''taking of Stone Hedge''' was an engagement of the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==History==
===Prelude===
[[File:2x5 Brackens.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Daemon threatens Lord Bracken.]]
In the early Dance of the Dragons, Houses [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken|Bracken]] enter open war, beginning with the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]].{{Ref|HOTD203}} Later, Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] joins with Willem Blackwood to defeat the Brackens and make them raise [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s banner, but Lord [[Amos Bracken]] remains defiant even in the face of Daemon's [[dragon]] [[Caraxes]]. Still intent on turning the Brackens to his cause, Daemon lets Amos live and orders Willem to harry House Bracken's [[smallfolk]] and force a surrender. Lambswold and [[Mory]] are brutally raided by the Blackwoods. [[Sept]]s are looted and put to the torch, fields and farms are burned, livestock are stolen, peasants are put to the sword, and women and children are taken from their homes.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

===Battle===
With the defenses of House Bracken dispersed due to the overwhelming raids on their lands, Willem is able to storm [[Stone Hedge]]. Lord Amos accepts his defeat and declares for the [[Blacks]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

===Aftermath===
Upon hearing the news, Daemon declares that the Blackwoods are to be congratulated and feted for their victory.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Daemon himself led the attack on Stone Hedge, with a strong host of [[House Darry|Darrys]], [[House Frey|Freys]], [[House Piper|Pipers]], and Rootes. House Blackwood did not directly participate, as they were fully focused on providing a distraction by raiding the surrounding lands.
