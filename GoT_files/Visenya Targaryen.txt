{{Quote|It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon, it was Rhaenys and Visenya, too... Rhaenys rode Meraxes, Visenya rode Vhagar... Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called 'Dark Sister'.|[[Arya Stark]]|A Man Without Honor}}
Queen '''Visenya Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Visenia Targārien''}} was a sister and wife of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. Along with her siblings, Visenya played a key role in [[Aegon's Conquest]] of [[Westeros]], her most notable action being the single-handed and bloodless conquest of the [[Vale of Arryn]].

==Biography==
===Background===
[[File:Aegon and sisters.jpg|thumb|left|Visenya and her siblings on Dragonstone.]]
Visenya was the sister of Aegon and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]], and was born on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] stronghold in the [[Narrow Sea]]. Following [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] [[incest|custom]], she and Rhaenys both married Aegon. All three siblings were [[dragonrider]]s, with Visenya riding the [[dragon]] known as [[Vhagar]]. She also wielded the [[Valyrian steel]] sword known as [[Dark Sister]].{{Ref|GOT207}}

All three Targaryen dragons were deployed at the [[Field of Fire]], where they destroyed the largest army ever seen in Westeros and a major resistance to their rule.{{Ref|GOT207}}

[[File:H&L109.png|thumb|Visenya Targaryen rode the dragon Vhagar.]]
[[File:Visenya and Rhaenys Targaryen.png|thumb|Visenya and her sister Rhaenys at Aegon's coronation.]]
Visenya was also responsible for bringing the Vale to heel. The Vale's seat of power, the [[Eyrie]], was impossible to take by conventional means owing to its natural defenses atop a mountain. Visenya, however, merely flew her dragon Vhagar over the narrow pass and mountain peaks to land in the courtyard of the Eyrie, where the young [[King of the Mountain and the Vale|King]] [[Ronnel Arryn]] was at play. Recalling the [[Burning of Harrenhal|fate]] of [[Harrenhal]] and its lords who refused to bend the knee, the Queen Regent of the Vale, [[Sharra Arryn]], surrendered peacefully on the condition that her son Ronnel be allowed to ride on Vhagar; Visenya kindly complied.{{Cite}}

Visenya outlived her husband and lived through the reigns of her nephew [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys]] and her son [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]]. She conducted Maegor's wedding to [[Alys Harroway]] in a secret Valyrian ceremony.{{Ref|H&L707}} Maegor died without issue, so Visenya is only a collateral ancestor of subsequent generations of House Targaryen.{{Ref|H&L806}}

[[Aemma Arryn|Aemma]] tells [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] that [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] hopes her unborn sibling will be a girl, and has already chosen the name Visenya and even picked out a dragon egg resembling Vhagar.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Rhaenyra planned to name [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|her daughter]] after Visenya,{{Guideref|Character Guide}} but she was stillborn.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Visenya is the oldest of the three Targaryen siblings born to [[Aerion Targaryen]], Lord of Dragonstone, and his wife, Valaena Velaryon. She is said to have been the more temperamental of Aegon's sisters. She was a noted warrior but also had diplomatic skills. After the razing of Harrenhal, she flew on her [[Vhagar|dragon]] to [[Crackclaw Point]] and won the support of the native inhabitants by promising that they would hold fealty only to the [[Iron Throne]] and no other lords.

''The World of Ice & Fire'' confirms that Visenya was the more martial of the two sisters. She supported the Targaryen fleet when it attempted to take [[Gulltown]] early during [[Aegon's Conquest]], but was unable to prevent its destruction at the hands of the [[House Arryn|Arryn]] fleet. She did destroy much of the Arryn fleet with her dragon in vengeance, but could not follow up on the victory. Later, she joined her brother-husband on the [[Field of Fire]], helping win a great victory there (despite sustaining a wound from an arrow). Afterwards she managed to secure the loyalty of [[House Arryn]] by simply flying her dragon to the [[Eyrie]] and allowing King [[Ronnel Arryn|Ronnel]], a child, a ride on her dragon's back, thus avoiding a bloody conflict.
[[File:Visenya slashes Aegon by Jota Saraiva.jpg|thumb]]
Though beautiful, skilled in battle and fierce, Visenya was somewhat stand-offish in matters of the heart. Aegon allegedly spent only one night with her for every ten he spent with Rhaenys. For that matter, Visenya was also a skilled ruler: Aegon did weigh in on major decisions both before and after the Conquest, but he usually left his sisters to handle the day-to-day tasks of governance (aided after the conquest by the new "Hand of the King", their [[bastard]] half-brother [[Orys Baratheon]]). It was Visenya who conceived of the [[Kingsguard]], as Aegon had been somewhat lax in security after the Conquest was completed, proven by Visenya slashing his face with [[Dark Sister]] and his guards being too slow on the draw. Even then, Aegon had Visenya design the order and iron out the details of its foundation.

Rhaenys died in [[Dorne]] before the end of Aegon's reign, and a few years after Aegon's death their bastard half-brother Orys died after an attempted conquest of Dorne, meaning that Visenya was the last surviving member of the Conquest-generation of Targaryens. She continued to exert political influence during the reign of Aegon's successor, Rhaenys's son [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys I]] - who proved to be a weakling, and was totally overwhelmed when the [[Faith Militant uprising]] broke out, and fled from King's Landing to Dragonstone.

The stress of the uprisings caused Aenys to fall gravely ill, and Visenya was called in to try to heal him with her arcane knowledge of potions. For a time, Aenys actually seemed to recover, but when news came that his son and daughter were besieged at [[Crakehall]], his health drastically worsened again. Some suspect that Visenya poisoned her nephew (which allegedly made her a kinslayer and a kingslayer), though others point out that he did seem to be recovering. Even those who suspect she killed him debate her motivations: some think it was a cynical power-grab for her son [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]], while others think she did it for the good of the Targaryen dynasty, as Aenys had proved to be a hapless failure and incapable of resisting the Faith Militant.

Within hours of Aenys's death, Visenya flew to [[Pentos]] to retrieve Maegor from exile. They returned with Vhagar, Maegor riding his father's dragon [[Balerion]], and an army of several hundred [[Mercenary|sellswords]]. Maegor then proclaimed himself king ahead of Aenys's surviving sons and daughters, usurping the throne, and proceeded to reclaim King's Landing.

Afterwards, Visenya actively look part in the conflict with the Faith Militant - riding her dragon to war despite being over 80 years old, burning out castles in the [[Riverlands]] as once she had burned out castles in Dorne.

Visenya developed a rivalry for the position of Maegor's closest advisor with Tyanna of the Tower, a new bride that Maegor had returned with from Pentos (whom he polygamously took as a third wife). Tyanna became Maegor's [[Master of Whisperers|mistress of whisperers]] with an extensive spy network, but she was also known to be an infamous poisoner and torture-master.

Maegor gave Aenys's last surviving children Jaehaerys and Alysanne as well as his widow Alyssa to Visenya as hostages. Visenya ultimately died late in Maegor's reign from a sudden illness. Maegor lost a key ally, and Vhagar was left riderless. Not long afterwards all the [[Great House]]s finally turned against Maegor openly, and he died on the Iron Throne itself.

Maegor was the only child that Visenya ever had. Maegor died without surviving issue, and so he was succeeded by Aenys's last surviving son [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]] - which means that later generations of Targaryens (such as [[Daenerys Targaryen]]) are descended from Rhaenys, not Visenya.
