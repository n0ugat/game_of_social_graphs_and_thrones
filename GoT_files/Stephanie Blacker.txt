'''Stephanie Blacker''' is a British actress.

She had a recurring role in the cult series ''The Cut'', and also appeared in ''Blessed'' and ''Doctors''.

She was cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]] of ''Game of Thrones'' as [[Violet]] in the episode "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]". She was announced on August 30 2012.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/08/stephanie-blacker-joins-the-cast/]</ref>

[[George R.R. Martin]] stated on the DVD commentary of "The Bear and the Maiden Fair" that he had written a scene involving Myranda and Violet for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth season]]. Blacker was not available for the fourth season as she was pregnant. Since Martin wrote "[[The Lion and the Rose]]", this seems to suggest that the role played by [[Tansy]] in the episode was originally intended for Violet.
