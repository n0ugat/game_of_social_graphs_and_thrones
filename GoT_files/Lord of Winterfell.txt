The '''Lord of Winterfell'''{{Ref|GOT101}}{{Note|Feminine: '''Lady of Winterfell'''{{Ref|GOT608}}}} is the ruler of the stronghold [[Winterfell]], the capital of the [[North]] and seat of [[House Stark]]. 

For generations, the title has been held by members of House Stark, until recently: during the [[War of the Five Kings]], the title was taken by enemies of the Starks (Greyjoys and Boltons), but eventually House Stark reclaimed Winterfell and this title after the [[Battle of the Bastards]]. 

According to the male-preference primogeniture law of inheritance followed in [[Westeros]], [[Bran Stark]] is the rightful heir to Winterfell, ahead of [[Jon Snow|Jon]], a bastard, and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], a female; however, Bran abdicated his [[lordship]] on the grounds that the [[Three-Eyed Raven]] cannot be the lord of anything. Bran's assertion upheld the recent status quo: Jon as Warden of the North and Sansa as Lady of Winterfell. However, after Sansa is crowned Queen in the North, both titles are presumably reunited under the current sovereign of the north.
