'''Hornwood'''{{Ref|GOT505}} is a castle in the [[North]]. It is the seat of the eponymous [[House Hornwood]], a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]].

Hornwood is located in forested lands southeast of Winterfell, southwest of the [[Dreadfort]] and northeast of [[White Harbor]], near the headwaters of the [[Broken Branch]] River.

House Hornwood allies with [[Jon Snow]] and [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] against [[House Bolton]].<ref>"[[The Broken Man]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Hornwood and its lands are located between the [[House Manderly|Manderlys]] of White Harbor and the [[House Bolton|Boltons]] of the Dreadfort and have been contested between the two in the past. The Hornwoods maintain their independence from both due to their loyalty to the Starks.
