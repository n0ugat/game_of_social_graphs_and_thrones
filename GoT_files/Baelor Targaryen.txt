==In the books==
In the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Baelor is named after King [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]]. He has a humble look to him, with short dark hair, brown eyes, a clean-shaven jaw, a twice-broken nose, and plain clothes of brown and green. He is known to be as wise, kind, and openhanded as his father Daeron II, whom he serves as Hand of the King and [[Protector of the Realm]]. He has two sons, named Valarr and Matarys.

Baelor won the name "Breakspear" at 17 for his victory against his uncle, Ser [[Daemon Blackfyre]], in the wedding tourney of Princess [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys Targaryen]].

Baelor fought against Daemon Blackfyre in the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], winning the [[Battle of the Redgrass Field]] alongside his brother [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar]] with their famous hammer-and-anvil maneuver.
