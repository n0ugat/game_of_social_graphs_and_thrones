Their castle was burned by King [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]]'s dragon [[Balerion]].{{Bookref|F&B|4}}

It is unknown whether House Broome is related to [[awoiaf:House Broom|House Broom]], one of the principal vassals of [[House Lannister]]. In ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', Ser Alfred Broome is shown wearing the sigil of House Broom on his armor, suggesting that House Broome and House Broom are in fact the same.
