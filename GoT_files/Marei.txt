{{Quote|Now, as it happens, Marei... is quite the spear-handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me.|[[Tyrion Lannister]] to [[Podrick Payne]], referring to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]|Walk of Punishment (episode)}}
'''Marei''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who works in [[Littlefinger's brothel]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
She is a new prostitute in Littlefinger's brothel. She is training with a male prostitute and receives instructions on how to act aroused by the veteran [[Ros]].{{Ref|GOT201}}

Later, a customer of the brothel watches Marei having sex with the same male prostitute through a spy-hole in the wall of one of the brothel's rooms.{{Ref|GOT202}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Along with [[Kayla]] and [[Genna]], she is one of the three prostitutes hired by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to service [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] as a reward for saving his life in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Marei and her colleagues attend to Podrick, taking his virginity and in the end they are apparently so satisfied with Podrick that they decline payment, much to the astonishment of Tyrion, [[Bronn]], Ros, and even [[Varys]].{{Ref|GOT303}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[File:401_Oberyn_Ellaria_at_brothel_kissing_Marei.jpg|thumb|Marei makes love with Ellaria.]]
Marei is the second of three prostitutes being offered to [[Oberyn Martell]] and [[Ellaria Sand]] by [[Olyvar]] (the first prostitute was dismissed as too timid). Ellaria is delighted to see that Marei is "not timid". When Oberyn asks her if she likes women, Marei says that she does, as long as they look like Ellaria, prompting the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] [[paramour]] to compliment Marei's good taste. She begins kissing Ellaria, but they are interrupted when Oberyn storms out of the room to confront two [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers.{{Ref|GOT401}}

Marei later services Ellaria during a private orgy also involving Oberyn, Olyvar, and a third prostitute, possibly to celebrate the recent assassination of King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] at [[Purple Wedding|his own wedding]]. [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] then interrupts, entering the room and saying he wants to discuss political matters with Oberyn in private - particularly, that he wants Oberyn to be a judge at his son Tyrion's [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister|trial]], and will give him a seat on the [[Small Council]] to ensure that Dorne continues to support Joffrey's younger brother [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Marei and the other prostitutes quickly leave, along with Ellaria.{{Ref|GOT403}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
When the [[Faith Militant]] is rearmed, they storm Littlefinger's brothel, driving out all of the prostitutes and clients. Marei is interrupted while in the middle of having sex with a man, Sparrows dragging her out of the brothel by her hair while she screams in terror. Olyvar tries to stop the man hauling her out but he simply gets hit in the face.{{Ref|GOT504}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Marei apparently managed to survive any rough treatment by the Faith Militant. Months later she is shown naked in [[Pycelle]]'s chambers after a night of sex (much as he earlier had sex with Ros and [[Daisy]]). As he gets ready to head out for the day, she gets annoyed and asks him where her money is. He waves her aside and says he'll pay later, at which she leaves. Pycelle did not live to pay her, however, as he was subsequently [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|assassinated]] by the [[Little birds]] on the order of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Qyburn]].{{Ref|GOT610}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Along with [[Dirah]] and [[Craya]], Marei was hired by [[Bronn]]. They lamented that some of their favorite boys had been killed by [[Drogon]] in the [[Battle of the Goldroad]]. As Marei mounted Bronn, Dirah was told by Craya that a soldier named [[Eddie]] had survived the battle but returned to King's Landing with his face burned off, leaving him without eyelids, to which Dirah asked how he slept without eyelids. The encounter came to an end when Qyburn entered and informed Bronn that he had an urgent request from Cersei.{{Ref|GOT801}}

It is unknown if she survived the [[Battle of King's Landing]], given that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and her armies slaughtered most of the population of King's Landing and destroyed many of its buildings.{{Ref|GOT805}}

==Behind the scenes==
Marei first appeared in the Season 2 premiere, but wasn't formally introduced and given a name until the third episode of Season 3. As of Season 6, following the death of [[Ros]] in Season 3, Marei became the longest recurring prostitute character in the series, both in total number of seasons and continuous seasons in a row. She appeared in eight episodes starting in Season 2, and for five continuous seasons through Season 6; she subsequently skipped Season 7 but then reappeared in Season 8. Ros did appear in more episodes overall (fourteen) and had more screentime, but she only appeared in three seasons (all in a row). Marei surpassed Ros as the longest recurring prostitute character in Season 5 - arguably Shae might be counted as recurring longer than Ros, with four continuous seasons, but she wasn't a character invented for the TV series. Either way, Marei's return in Season 6 meant she appeared in five continuous seasons of the TV series, also surpassing Shae's record.

Josephine Gillan explained in an interview after Season 5 that for the episode "Sons of the Harpy", when the Faith Militant storm Littlefinger's brothel and drag Marei out of the building, it was originally planned that they would punch Marei in the face, so hard (possibly breaking Marei's nose or jaw) that Gillan was going to need to have a large amount of fake blood continuing to pour out of her mouth as she is dragged away. The production team later decided, however, that seeing a woman beaten up like this was too dark and violent for the needs of the scene, and just had her dragged away by her hair.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JinwSGyeZ78 Josephine Gillan interview, October 2015]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is a prostitute named Marei at Chataya's establishment. She is a fairly minor character, and apart from the name and the general fact that she is a prostitute in King's Landing, Marei in the TV series isn't particularly based on Marei from the books (in fact, the TV character was only given the name the season after she was introduced). Most of Marei's scenes so far in the TV series have no direct counterpart in the narrative of the novels. Nonetheless she is not, strictly speaking, a character ''entirely'' "invented" for the TV series the way Ros or Armeca were.

Marei in the books has green eyes, porcelain skin, and silvery hair, but is also very solemn. She is also literate. While in the TV series Bronn celebrated being knighted by having sex with [[Mirelle]], in the books he celebrated by having sex with Marei and another prostitute named Alayaya, simultaneously. This occurred at the beginning of the third novel, and correspondingly, Bronn celebrated his knighthood by going to the brothel at the beginning of Season 3. Marei has not been mentioned in the novels afterwards.

There is a fan theory that Marei is [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s bastard daughter. She has blonde hair and green eyes like the Lannisters, and her age would put her birth during the years when Tywin was in the city as Hand of the King. Tyrion also notices that unlike most of the prostitutes in the brothel, she is literate - perhaps hinting that she's the bastard of a lord who cared about his illegitimate offspring enough, though at a distance, that he ordered the brothel owners to at least make sure she learned to read. [[George R.R. Martin]] was asked whether Tywin had any bastards (in general); his answer was "He'd [Tywin] have you flogged for the mere suggestion".<ref>[https://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Various_questions_concerning_Tywin_Oberyn_Gregor_the_North_and_Sansa/ So Spake Martin, April 15, 2008]</ref> 

In the TV series, Tyrion pronounces her name "Muh-ray" (with a short A), as opposed to "Mare-ay" (that is, with a long A).
