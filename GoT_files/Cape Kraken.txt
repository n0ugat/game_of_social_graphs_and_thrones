'''Cape Kraken'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a region in the south-west of the [[North]]. It is south-west of [[Moat Cailin]], west of the [[Neck]] and south of [[Blazewater Bay]]. [[Ironman's Bay]] and the [[Iron Islands]] are to their south. The castle [[Flint's Finger]] is in the north-east of the region.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cape Kraken is named for the [[ironborn]] (whose sigil is a [[kraken]]) who used to raid heavily along its coasts. Being located south of the Neck, its cultural and social ties with [[Winterfell]] are somewhat loose.
