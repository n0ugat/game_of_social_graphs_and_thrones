The '''Sept of Remembrance'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was formerly the headquarters of the [[Faith Militant]] in the early years of [[King's Landing]], located atop Rhaenys's Hill.

==History==
[[File:HL5 Balerion burns Sept of Remembrance 3.png|thumb|Gathered for morning prayers, the Faith Militant were all burned inside the sept.]]
The Sept of Remembrance was the local headquarters of the [[Faith Militant]] in [[King's Landing]].

The order seized control of the capital city at the beginning of the [[Faith Militant uprising]], causing the weak King [[Aenys Targaryen]] to flee the city, after which he soon died from the stress. He was succeeded by his vicious younger half-brother, [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]], who returned to King's Landing and promptly [[Burning of the Sept of Remembrance|burned down the sept]] using the [[dragon]] [[Balerion]], while all of the local Faith Militant members were gathered inside for morning prayers.<ref>"[[The Faith Militant]]"</ref>

The sept was never rebuilt. Instead, Maegor ordered the construction of the [[Dragonpit]] over its ruins.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the "Sept of Remembrance" was so-named in honor of Aenys's mother [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]], who had died thirty years before in the [[First Dornish War]] - as opposed to Maegor's still-living mother [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]], who always resented that Rhaenys's son Aenys was put ahead of her son in line of succession. Maegor's destruction of the sept was thus also something of a slight against the rival branch of House Targaryen (though Aenys was dead, Maegor usurped the throne ahead of Aenys's ''five'' children three sons and two daughters). A few years later, as if to hammer home his dominance over the Faith Militant, instead of having the sept rebuilt Maegor ordered that a massive "stable for dragons" should be built over its ruins: the [[Dragonpit]].
