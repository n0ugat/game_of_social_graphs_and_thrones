Prince '''Aegon Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Āegon Targārien''}} was a member of [[House Targaryen]], the eldest son of King [[Aenys Targaryen]], and a claimant to the [[Iron Throne]] after learning that his uncle, [[Maegor Targaryen]] had taken the throne.

==Biography==
Prince Aegon was named after his grandfather, [[Aegon I Targaryen]] (known as "Aegon the Conqueror").{{Cite}}

Prince Aegon was wed to his own older sister, [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena]], by her father King Aenys, according to [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] custom. The leadership of the [[Faith of the Seven]], who already had strained relations with the crown, condemned this [[Incest|incestuous]] union, and the [[Faith Militant]] [[Faith Militant uprising|revolted]] against the Targaryens.{{Ref|H&L502}}

After the death of King Aenys, his half-brother [[Maegor Targaryen|Prince Maegor]] flew to [[Dragonstone]] and demanded the crown. When [[Grand Maester]] [[Gawen]] objected, stating that Aegon was the rightful heir, Maegor declared that the [[Iron Throne]] should pass to the man with the strength to seize it, and promptly beheaded the Grand Maester. Upon hearing the news, Aegon claimed his father's [[dragon]] [[Quicksilver]], raised a host of [[Westerlands|westermen]], and marched on [[King's Landing]] while Maegor was in [[Oldtown]]. Maegor responded by having his bannermen ambush Aegon's army from all sides beneath the [[Gods Eye]] while he arrived on [[Balerion]]. During what came to be known as the [[Battle Beneath the Gods Eye]], Aegon fell to his death in a confrontation between the two dragons. Maegor earned the epithet "the Cruel" for [[Kinslaying|slaying his own nephew]].{{Ref|H&L806}}

His younger brother [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]], who married their other sister [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]], ultimately assumed the throne after the death of Maegor.{{Ref|hotd101}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Prince Aegon was the eldest son and second-born child of King Aenys, after his sister Rhaena. He was named after his grandfather, Aegon the Conqueror. Author [[George R.R. Martin]] made it a point that names often repeat in real-life royal dynasties - his prior work in television had strictly forbid re-using names for fear that this might confuse the audience, but he found this unrealistic. Moreover, many royal names were re-used for princes who never actually ruled (i.e. "Edward the Black Prince" during the Hundred Years War predeceased his father and thus isn't in the official number count of kings named "Edward"). In his own words, Martin explained:

:Martin: "I wrote these books, never dreaming they would be filmed or made. It was almost a reaction to my tenure in Hollywood. 'I'm just going to do this as big as I want.' But I broke a lot of rules in writing these books, that you're taught as a writer, that I certainly was taught. But at certain point I thought, 'To hell with those rules'.
:Question: "What rules?"
:Martin: "Well, having so many characters, for one. Having similar names. Stuff like that. I remember as a little baby writer I was taught never have two characters whose names begin with the same letter because people will get them confused. And I realized I was going to have more than 26 characters, so that would have to go out the window. - And also I was reading a lot of history. [People said], 'Never have two characters with the same letter? Certainly never have two characters with the same name.' But then I'm saying, 'That's so unrealistic'. I mean, English history is entirely composed of Henrys and Edwards. There's endless Henrys and Edwards, and you know, '''not only kings, who at least get numbers, but the guys who never become king. They're princes, and then they die. They're not even distinguished by numbers and it's very hard to keep all these guys straight.''' But that's the way history actually was. Families using the same name over again. And I like that element of verisimilitude, [so] I adopted that."<ref>Anders, Charlie Jane.

King Aegon I, the Conqueror, had maintained a polygamous marriage with both of his sisters: Aenys's mother Rhaenys and Maegor's mother Visenya. Aegon himself always treated Aenys as his heir apparent because he was older than Maegor - though given young Aenys's frailty, there were some who muttered that Maegor should be his heir, given that he was his "firstborn" by Visenya - those who said this were chiefly Visenya herself, and her supporters, though Aegon I would hear none of it.

Thus, the birth of Aenys's own children pushed Maegor even further back in the line of succession, as by the normal laws of Westeros an uncle only inherits after his elder brother's entire bloodline is extinguished. For that matter, as the years passed Maegor failed to produce any heir, and there were fears that he was sterile - causing him to lose supporters, who didn't think it was worth upsetting Aegon I's intended succession for an heir who couldn't continue the family line anyway.

Aegon I was still wary of offending the Faith of the Seven, and promised them that his family's incestuous marriage practices were a relic of the past which they wouldn't continue in the future. To assure him of this, he had Aenys marry Alyssa Velaryon as a political match, who was mother to all of his children. Maegor's mother Visenya didn't give up on her ambitions in court politics, however, pushing for Maegor to one day succeed ahead of Aenys. Thus when Rhaena was born, Visenya urged Aegon I to betroth her to her Maegor, her own half-uncle. Aegon I, however, dismissed the suggestion - both because he didn't want to risk offending the Faith with such an incestuous marriage, and (it is believed) because he had become frustrated with Visenya's constant attempts to usurp Rhaenys's son Aenys with her own.

[[File:HL5 Marriage of Aenys's children to each other.png|thumb|The incestuous marriage of King Aenys's own son and daughter to each other sparked the [[Faith Militant uprising]].]]
Prince Aegon was born in 26 AC, and his father announced his marriage to his older sister Rhaena in 41 AC - when he was 15 years old and his sister was 18 years old (when Prince Aegon was around the same age that [[Robb Stark]] was in the second novel). No one knows exactly why Aenys launched into such an obvious folly, given how strained his relations with the Faith already were: some suspect that as the [[Red Keep]]'s construction grew, he began to think on the glorious Targaryen legacy he would leave behind, and thus he gave more focus to "keeping the bloodline pure".

Prince Aegon and Rhaena were making a royal progress through the realm when the [[Faith Militant uprising]] struck: they were in the [[Westerlands]] at the time, and were besieged in [[Crakehall]] castle. Within a few weeks, their father Aenys fled to Dragonstone and died in 42 AC (possibly poisoned by Visenya). Maegor then retook King's Landing using [[Balerion]], and usurped the throne ahead of Prince Aegon (and Aenys's other four children). When the Faith Militant besieging them at Crakehall departed to obey the High Septon's call to war against Maegor, Aegon and Rhaena fled to [[Casterly Rock]]. The Lannisters extended Aegon and Rhaena [[Guest right]] but would not rise against Maegor, leaving them stranded for some time. It was difficult for Maegor to pursue them due to having to devote much of his attention to campaigns against the Faith Militant in central Westeros.

In 43 AC, Prince Aegon himself rallied an army to rebel against his half-uncle Maegor, riding Aenys's own dragon Quicksilver. They clashed in the great Battle Beneath the God's Eye, but Maegor rode the awesome [[Balerion]], killing both Quicksilver and Aegon.

In the intervening years Rhaena had given birth to twin daughters, Aerea and Rhaella, and she fled with them to [[Fair Isle]] off the west coast for some time. They were ultimately found, however, and taken captive back to Maegor's court at King's Landing, where she was forced to marry him as one of his "black brides". She later escaped on her dragon [[Dreamfyre]] and rallied to Aenys's last surviving son, [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]]. Rhaena actually outlived Maegor, though no information has been given so far on her subsequent life, or that of Prince Aegon's twin daughters.

An unanswered question is how Prince Aegon came to be the rider of his father's dragon Quicksilver: he could only have bonded with it after Aenys died, but Maegor would never have willingly let him claim such a dangerous beast. Moreover, it is unknown why his sister-wife Rhaena was already bonded with a dragon ([[Dreamfyre]]), while Aegon - heir apparent to the throne - was not. Maegor himself had put off claiming one of the half-dozen or so hatchlings on Dragonstone during his father's reign, apparently waiting until Aegon the Conqueror died so he could claim the great [[Balerion]] for himself. It is possible that Prince Aegon hadn't bonded with a dragon hatchling yet because he was simply too young: Rhaena had Dreamfyre but she was three years older than him. The Targaryens later practiced putting dragon eggs in the cradles of their children to try to ensure the bonding process (with varying levels of success) but it is possible that this custom was only developed later - though Aenys himself was given the hatchling Quicksilver when he was only three years old.
