The '''Gullet'''{{Ref|HOTD110}} is the stretch of ocean located between [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] and [[Driftmark]]. [[Blackwater Bay]] opens into the Gullet, connecting it with the overall [[Narrow Sea]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
At the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], [[Corlys Velaryon]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] prepare to blockade the Gullet with the [[Velaryon fleet]] and the [[dragon]] [[Meleys]] in order to cut off trade to [[King's Landing]], which remains under the control of the [[Greens]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s fleet is scattered by a storm in the Gullet prior to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. This event causes Stannis's attack to be delayed long enough for the armies led by [[Tywin Lannister]] and [[Mace Tyrell]] to reach King's Landing in time and take the Stannis's army in the back.
