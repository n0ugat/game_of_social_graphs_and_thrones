She is the [[Dragonrider|rider]] of the [[dragon]] [[Dreamfyre]].{{Guideref|Dreamfyre}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Helaena is the only daughter of King Viserys I and his second wife, Queen Alicent. She has three full brothers, [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]], and [[Daeron Targaryen|Daeron]], and one half-sister, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Helaena's mother has trouble soothing her as an infant. Whenever Alicent is seen holding her, Helaena constantly cries.{{Ref|HOTD104}}{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Ten years later, Helaena examines a millipede as her mother sits beside her, listing facts about the creature. Her brother [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] is then brought in after being retrieved from the [[Dragonpit]]. As Alicent interrogates him, Helaena quietly says to herself that the last ring on the millipede has no legs at all. When she hears her mother tell Aemond that he will have a dragon one day, Helaena states that he will have to close an eye.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Later, during a [[Small Council]] meeting, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] proposes a marriage between her eldest son [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] and Helaena as a way of bridging the gap between two branches of House Targaryen. While Viserys seems interested in the idea, Alicent furiously refuses it when he brings it up after the meeting.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

During [[Laena Velaryon]]'s funeral, Aegon and Aemond discuss the former's betrothal to Helaena as she studies a spider and mutters cryptically about flesh dragons weaving thread dragons of [[Blacks|black]] and [[Greens|green]], and then proceeds to crush the spider with a seashell. Aegon laments their betrothal, considering her an idiot, while Aemond states that he would do his duty if he were betrothed to her.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Later, Helaena flies back to [[King's Landing]] on her dragon [[Dreamfyre]].{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Six years later, Helaena and Aegon are married and have two children together: [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and [[Jaehaera Targaryen|Jaehaera]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Helaena walks in on a conversation between Alicent and Aegon, asking where their household servant [[Dyana]] is as she is supposed to dress the children, unaware that Dyana has just been raped by Aegon. Alicent hugs Helaena afterwards.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

A disinterested Helaena hears the petitions of [[Vaemond Velaryon]] and Rhaenyra on behalf of her son [[Lucerys Velaryon]] over the succession to [[Driftmark]]. When her father enters the [[throne room]] to defend Rhaenyra, Helaena smiles. Moments later, she covers her ears in shock as her uncle [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] beheads Vaemond after he calls out the [[bastard]]y of Rhaenyra's children.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Helaena has dinner with her family that night. Following Rhaenyra's, Alicent's, and Jacaerys's toasts, Helaena cryptically mutters to beware the "beast beneath the boards" under her breath before making her own toast to her cousins [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]], who have been betrothed to Jacaerys and Lucerys. She tells them that marriage "isn't so bad," and makes a jape at Aegon, saying that the husband mostly ignores the wife except for when he's drunk, which elicits laughter from Daemon and praise from [[Otto Hightower|Otto]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

After the musicians start playing, Jace asks Helaena for a dance, which she happily accepts. The happy dance is interrupted by Aemond smashing his fist on the table to make his own toast, calling his nephews "[[House Strong|Strong]]." Helaena almost claps, not understanding that the comment refers to Jace's rumored father, the deceased [[Harwin Strong]], but stops herself when Jace takes offense.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

After Viserys's death, Alicent goes to Helaena to learn of Aegon's whereabouts, though Helaena is not of much help to her, again telling her that "there is a beast beneath the boards," this time with increased urgency. She later attends Aegon's coronation at the [[Dragonpit]]. When [[Rhaenys Targaryen]] bursts through the floor on her dragon [[Meleys]], Alicent orders Ser [[Criston Cole]] to escort Helaena to safety.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Helaena is with her daughter Jaehaera when Aegon arrives in her chambers, looking for Jaehaerys. Helaena is hesitant at first, but eventually tells him that he's in the library. Before Aegon leaves, Helaena tells him that she is afraid. Aegon reassures her that she has nothing to fear, but she says that she's instead afraid of "the rats." Baffled, Aegon simply jokes that the queen is an "enduring mystery" before leaving.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

That night, Helaena is putting her children to bed when two men attack her in her chambers, demanding "a son for a son." Helaena tries to bribe them with her necklace, but they rip it from her and demand she point to her son, as the assassins are unable to tell the twins apart. Helaena reluctantly points out Jaehaerys, and runs out of the room with her daughter as the two saw Jaehaerys's head off with their knife. She runs to her mother's chambers, only to find her having sex with Ser Criston Cole. Traumatized by the death of her son, Helaena can only mutter that Jaehaerys is dead.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

The next day, the Green Council decides to arrange a funeral for Jaehaerys, with Alicent and Helaena behind them. When Alicent informs Helaena of this plan, she says she doesn't want to, clearly still shaken by the death of her son. Alicent then claims that the smallfolk must share their grief, but Helaena doesn't want them to as she doesn't know them. Alicent presses on, only for Helaena to give her a blanket, saying it was for her boy.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

At the funeral, Helaena is surrounded by sympathetic smallfolk, but as the wagon becomes stuck in a pothole, she begins to suffer a panic attack as the people crowd around her. Later, she passes by Aegon, but they don't say anything to each other.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

==Personality==
Helaena is considered eccentric and peculiar, having an interest in bugs and at times speaking in cryptic language.{{Guideref|Helaena Targaryen}} Helaena is also seen to reject any physical contact from others, including her own mother.{{Ref|HOTD106}}{{Ref|HOTD202}} She chooses to stay away of politics and instead prefers to stay in her chambers isolated from people.{{Ref|HOTD201}} Helaena doesn't like being near people like the [[smallfolk]], because she doesn't know them.{{Ref|HOTD202}} Helaena was noted by many, including her mother and half-sister, to be the gentlest and kindest of her family. This can be notablly be seen where Helaena refuses to participate in any of the battles during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. A clear example shown when Aemond had come to demand her help against Rhaenyra and her new dragon riders, Helaena adamantly refused to participate and expressed her refusal use her dragon to burn anyone alive.

==Behind the scenes==
On March 30, 2022, [[HBO]] announced that [[Phia Saban]] had been cast in the role of Helaena Targaryen for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. Her character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] reads as follows:
:''"Second-born daughter of Viserys, sister to Aegon and Aemond, half-sister to Rhaenyra."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

Her character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"The sister and wife to King Aegon II and mother to the young Prince Jaehaerys and Princess Jaehaera. Considered strange by her family, she often perceives things that others do not. Helaena claimed Dreamfyre, but chooses not to ride her dragon."''{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

Actress [[Lulu Barker]] started to play Helaena's daughter, Jaehaera, in Season 2. Her sister, [[Ziggy Barker|Ziggy]], previously portrayed the infant Helaena in Season 1.

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Helaena Targaryen was the second daughter of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]], born in 109 AC. As a child, she was plumper and less striking than most members of [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]], but was pleasant and happy nonetheless and beloved by the [[smallfolk]] as she grew older.

There is no mention in the books that Helaena had prophetical abilities or any supernatural powers in general. The ability to have prophetic dreams is passed down through the Targaryen bloodline, with some inheriting it more strongly than others or not at all. In the TV series, Viserys himself explains it is rare even in their bloodline and he believes he had a prophetic dream exactly once - that he'd have a son who would sit the Iron Throne - but this one dream strongly influenced his actions ever since.{{Ref|HOTD101}} Both Daenerys and Jon Snow have prophetic dreams in the novels, but they are not yet aware that they are truly prophetic in nature. 

Another Targaryen who did strongly inherit this ability, however, was "Daeron the Drunken" - eldest brother of Aegon "Egg" Targaryen, one of the two protagonists in the Dunk & Egg novellas. Daeron is so haunted by his prophetic dreams that he self-medicates with alcohol, desperately trying to have dreamless sleep. Unlike TV-Helaena, he is fully aware that his dreams are prophetic and directly shares them with other people such as Dunk to try to warn them, but the dreams are often so symbolic that Daeron himself isn't sure how to interpret them.
