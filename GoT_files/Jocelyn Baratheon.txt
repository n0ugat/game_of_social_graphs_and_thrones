{{Quote|You have Baratheon blood from your grandmother, Rhaenys.|[[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] to [[Lucerys Velaryon]]|The Black Queen}}
'''Jocelyn Baratheon''' was the wife of Prince [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Aemon Targaryen]], and the mother of Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen]].

==Biography==
Born a [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]], Lady Jocelyn wed Prince Aemon Targaryen, the eldest son of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]]. They had one daughter, Princess Rhaenys. Jocelyn passed away by 112 AC.{{Dateref|The Heirs of the Dragon}}{{Guideref|Character Guide}}

==Family==
{{Targaryen tree (House of the Dragon)}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Jocelyn is the daughter of Lord Rogar Baratheon and Queen Alyssa Velaryon, the latter of whom was the widow of King [[Aenys I Targaryen]]. Her mother died giving birth to her; her father believed she was to be a son, and risked her mother's life by agreeing to a dangerous procedure that cost Alyssa her life, to the horror of Jocelyn's much older half-sister, Princess [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena]]. Jocelyn was the full sister of Lord [[Boremund Baratheon]].

Jocelyn was eventually fostered at [[King's Landing]] as a [[ward]] of her half-siblings, King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] and Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]] at the request of her terminally ill father. She sat by her half-nephew, Prince Aemon, in the ceremony after he was invested as [[Prince of Dragonstone]]. They were betrothed some years later, though Aemon had originally been betrothed to his older sister Daenerys, who had died of the Shivers. Some years later, they were wed in a splendid ceremony.

Jocelyn had only one child: a daughter, Rhaenys, who for a time was considered as a potential future queen of Westeros. However, Jocelyn was widowed when her husband died on [[Tarth]], attempting to stop an invasion of the island by [[Myr]]ish pirates. She was angered to see her daughter and potential descendants passed over when King Jaehaerys declared her husband's younger brother, Prince [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon Targaryen]], to be the new Prince of Dragonstone. Though she lived to see the birth of her granddaughter, [[Laena Velaryon]], her precise date of death is unknown.

It is unclear if Jocelyn is the sister of Boremund Baratheon in the TV series, as Rhaenys addresses him as her cousin rather than her uncle.
