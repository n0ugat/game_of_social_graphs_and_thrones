==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'' and the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of an island called Dwarfstone, either in the Stepstones or elsewhere. Only two of the islands in the Stepstones have been named: Bloodstone and Grey Gallows. A third island, Torturer's Deep, is mentioned in the "Arianne I" sample chapter of the sixth novel.{{Bookref|TWOW|Arianne I}}
