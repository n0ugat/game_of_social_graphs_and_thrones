{{Dialogue a-b-a-b|Doreah|Have you seen one?|Viserys|A pirate ship?|A dragon!|No. No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen:  their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room with them in the [[Red Keep]]...the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch, and they were all stunted and wrong, skulls no bigger than dog skulls...|[[Doreah]] and [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]]|Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things}}
The '''last dragon''' belonging to [[House Targaryen]] died more than a century before [[Robert's Rebellion]], during the reign of [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon III Targaryen]]. Her death marked the extinction of [[dragon]]s in [[Westeros]] and beyond until the birth of [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s dragons.

==Biography==
===Background===
[[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] believes that the last dragon's death was a precursor of the eventual downfall of the Targaryens.{{Ref|H&L310}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
At [[Vaes Dothrak]], [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] bathes with [[Doreah]] and she tells him that she wants to see a dragon more than anything and asks if he has seen one. He replies that he has not, as the last one died many years before he was born. He tells her that he saw their skulls when he was a child, as they were used to decorate the [[Red Keep]]. He tells her that the ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch. He says that they were stunted and wrong, their skulls no bigger than a dog's.{{Ref|GOT104}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
While unchaining [[Viserion]] and [[Rhaegal]] in the catacombs beneath [[Meereen]]'s temple, [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] reminisced about wanting a dragon when he was young, but being told by [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] that the last dragon had died a century prior.{{Ref|GOT602}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the last dragon was a green female who died during the reign of King [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon III Targaryen]], who earned the nickname "The Dragonbane" as he was blamed for her death; it was rumored he poisoned the dragon, because he was afraid of dragons ever since he had seen [[Aegon II Targaryen|his uncle]]'s [[Sunfyre|dragon]] devour [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|his mother]].

The last dragon was sickly, small, misshapen and stunted, with withered wings. Her name is not known. Although she was sickly, she did lay a clutch of five eggs, which never hatched.

In ''The Hedge Knight'', the first of the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] remembers his late mentor Ser Arlan of [[Pennytree]] telling him that he had seen the last dragon when he was a child.

When Tyrion first came to [[King's Landing]] for his sister's wedding, he found the nineteen dragon skulls stored in a dank cellar. Among them there was a matched pair of skulls, no bigger than mastiff's skulls, and oddly misshapen, all that remained of the last two hatchlings born on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. He mused that they were the last of the Targaryen dragons, perhaps the last dragons anywhere, and they had not lived very long. 

In the fifth novel, Tyrion recalls that when he was a child, his uncles [[Tygett Lannister|Tygett]] and [[Gerion Lannister|Gerion]] asked him what gift he wanted for his nameday, and he begged them for a dragon. "It wouldn't need to be a big one. It could be little, like I am." Gerion thought that was the funniest thing he had ever heard, but Tygett said, "The last dragon died a century ago, lad." Tyrion was devastated to hear that.
