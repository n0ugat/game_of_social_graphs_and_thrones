'''House Connington'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} of [[Griffin's Roost]] is a vassal house that holds fealty to [[House Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]]. Their castle is Griffin's Roost, located south-west of Storm's End on the western edge of [[Shipbreaker Bay]].

==History==
During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Lord [[Jon Connington]] led an attack on [[Stoney Sept]]. Insisting on engaging [[Robert Baratheon]] in single combat, his army was defeated when [[Eddard Stark]] arrived to aid Robert with reinforcements, resulting in the [[Battle of the Bells]].{{Ref|H&L310}}

==Members==
*Lord {[[Jon Connington]]}, the former head of the house. [[Hand of the King]] to [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. Died in [[exile]] after [[Robert's Rebellion]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Conningtons were a significantly wealthy house during the rule of [[House Targaryen]]. Their sigil is two griffins combatant countercharged per pale on red and white. [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] Alyn Connington was one of the best war leaders in the history of the [[Kingsguard]].

Lord Armond Connington always desired land, and he once sought assistance from Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] regarding a dispute with Lord Morrigen. ''[[Book of Brothers|The Book of the Brothers]]'' entry on [[Barristan Selmy]] records how he defeated Armond's son, Lord Jon Connington, in the Tourney at [[Storm's End]]. [[Ashara Dayne]] danced with Jon at the Tourney at [[Harrenhal]].

Jon was later named Hand of the King by the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen. The previous Hand, Owen Merryweather, had been exiled for his failure to face Robert's Rebellion, and Lord Connington was a noted warrior of proven loyalty, being one of Prince Rhaegar's best friends. During the [[Battle of the Bells]] at [[Stoney Sept]], Jon wounded [[Hoster Tully]] and killed Ser Denys Arryn, the Darling of the Vale, with an axe. After being defeated by the rebels at Stoney Sept, Jon was stripped of his lands and sent into exile in the [[Free Cities]], where he allegedly drank himself to death, but it was a subterfuge; in ''A Dance with Dragons'', it is revealed he is alive, and acts as the guardian of [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia.

Aerys allowed the Connington lands to remain with Jon's cousin, Ronald Connington, the castellan of Griffin's Roost, but Ronald joined the rebellion after the [[Battle of the Trident]]. When [[Robert Baratheon]] was crowned king after the death of Aerys, he allowed Ronald to keep Griffin's Roost, but the Conningtons lost their lordship and nine-tenths of their land was distributed among neighbors who were more fervent in their support of Robert. House Connington's status thus fell from from being a full noble house to a knightly one.

Through the initiative of Ronald, his son Ronnet was betrothed when he was sixteen to twelve-year-old [[Brienne of Tarth]]. Ronnet rejected her when he met her, however, as he did not find Brienne attractive. Ronnet now rules as the Knight of Griffin's Roost.

Red Ronnet declares for [[Renly Baratheon]] at the onset of the [[War of the Five Kings]], goes over to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] after Renly's [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|death]] and participates in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], where he's made prisoner. Afterward he's among the many of Stannis's bannermen that bend the knee to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].
