Lord '''Hobert Hightower''' was the head of [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|House Hightower]] and Lord of [[Oldtown]] during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]]. He was the older brother of Ser [[Otto Hightower]], the [[Hand of the King]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Hobert is married to [[Lynesse Hightower]],{{Ref|HOTD103}} with whom he has a son named [[Ormund Hightower|Ormund]].{{Ref|HOTD201}} He has a younger brother, [[Otto Hightower|Otto]], who serves as [[Hand of the King]] to King [[Viserys I Targaryen]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
In [[112 AC]],{{Dateref|The Heirs of the Dragon}} Lord Hobert attends court in [[King's Landing]] and swears an oath of fealty to King Viserys in the [[throne room]] to recognize [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] as heir to the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|HOTD101}} Hobert's niece [[Alicent Hightower]] marries King Viserys.{{Ref|HOTD102}}
[[File:SOHN Hobert Hightower Still.jpg|thumb|Hobert attends the Royal Hunt.]]
In [[115 AC]],{{Dateref|Second of His Name}} During the preparations for the second name-day of Alicent's son, [[Prince]] [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]], Hobert quietly pressures Otto to sway the [[king]] to name Aegon as his heir as his firstborn son. Later at the hunt, Hobert publicly hails the infant prince as "[[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]-Babe, Second of His Name", in spite of his previous oath to the [[Prince of Dragonstone|Princess of Dragonstone]].{{Ref|HOTD103}}

In [[116 AC]],{{Dateref|King of the Narrow Sea}} Lord Hobert is mentioned by his younger brother Otto in a meeting of the [[Small Council]]. Otto reveals he received a disturbing report from Hobert; Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] has started negotiations with the [[Sealord of Braavos]], planning to marry [[Laena Velaryon]] to the Sealord's son.{{Ref|HOTD104}}[[File:WLTW Hobert and Lynesse Still.jpg|thumb|Hobert and his wife at the royal wedding.]]In the same year, Lord Hobert travels to King's Landing, alongside his [[Lynesse Hightower|wife]] and other members of their family, to attend the celebrations for the royal wedding of Princess Rhaenyra to Ser [[Laenor Velaryon]]. Like the other guests, he is astonished when Alicent wears the green Hightower colors instead of those of [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]], but is the first to stand as Alicent makes her way to the high table of the throne room. When Alicent later steps down to greet her uncle, Hobert assures her that she has the support and loyalty of [[Oldtown]].{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Eventually, Hobert takes his niece's [[Daeron Targaryen|youngest son]] as a [[ward]].{{Webref|name=Variety |author=Adam B.

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Hobert Outfit.png|thumb|Hunting attire.]]In the script for "[[Second of His Name]]", Hobert further explains that the [[War for the Stepstones]] affects Oldtown positively due to the change in trade routes. Otto is surprised Hobert would suggest he would wage a war to better his own house. Hobert dismisses Otto's self-righteousness, claming that Otto's objectivity died when he "delivered" Alicent to the King.{{Webref|name=Script 1x02 |author=@darksvster |date=March 28, 2024 |url=https://darksvster.tumblr.com/post/746244302517288960/excerpts-from-the-house-of-the-dragon |title=Missing Scene From the House of the Dragon Script |website=Tumblr |access-date=June 19, 2024 }}

Lord Hobert was also mentioned in an earlier draft of the script for "[[Driftmark (episode)|Driftmark]]," in which [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] inquires about his younger brother Daeron to [[Otto Hightower|Otto]].{{Webref|name=Script |author=@darksvster |date=March 11, 2024 |url=https://twitter.com/darksvster/status/1767143440914039151 |title=Missing Scene From the House of the Dragon Script |website=X |access-date=March 11, 2024 }}
==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the given name of Lord Hightower during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]] is not revealed. He once received a letter from his brother Otto, containing the words: "On no account can Prince [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] be allowed to ascend to the [[Iron Throne]]. [...] He would be a second [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]], or worse. [...] Better the [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Realm's Delight]] than Lord [[Flea Bottom]]." Besides this, nothing more is heard from Lord Hightower. He was succeeded by his son [[Ormund Hightower|Ormund]] by the time of the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

There is a character in ''Fire & Blood'' named [[awoiaf:Hobert Hightower|Hobert Hightower]], but he is not the same character.
