==''House of the Dragon''==
On 5 October 2020, it was announced that Considine would be portraying Viserys I Targaryen in [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] of ''House of the Dragon''. He was the first casting that was publicly announced.

On 2 April 2022, in an interview with ''The Independent'', Considine spoke for the first time on how he approached the role:

:''"When I played Viserys Targaryen, I just played my mum, you know. That's what I played – my mother" (Interviewer Question: was she a powerful individual?) "It wasn’t so much that, really. She was just an anchor for me. I loved her very much. But she was a woman who became very, very sick. She had diabetes. She lost sight in both of her eyes. And she lost both of her legs. She was in a terrible, terrible state. But I think she hid inside her illness, and that made it worse for her. And it was a lot for us and everyone around to care for her, whereas she needed to care for herself, too. And that's what this character does, eventually, you know...he becomes very sick and hides in his illness."''

:''"But what this character does have is my mother's passion and love for the people that are close to him. You know, when he meets his grandchildren – and it doesn't [usually] happen in Game of Thrones – he picks them up, and kisses them, and holds them, and it's like, it's bringing that aspect of love to what could be a very stiff character. It's breathing some humanity [into him]. I just used my mum as the template."''<ref>[https://winteriscoming.net/2022/04/04/house-of-the-dragon-paddy-considine-based-targaryen-king-mother/ ''The Independent'',] Paddy Considine interview, 2 April 2022</ref>

[[George R.R. Martin]] is very impressed by Considine, stating that his performance gives Viserys's show character a tragic majesty that the book character never quite achieved.<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/06/01/ Not A Blog: Good Stuff, Bad Stuff, Strange Stuff (June 1, 2022)]</ref>
