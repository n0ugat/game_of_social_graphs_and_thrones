==History==
[[File:Corlys.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Corlys Velaryon in ''House of the Dragon''.]]
On March 18, 2021, ''Deadline'' first reported a new wave of prequel pitches was being considered by HBO, among which was a "young [[Corlys Velaryon]]" series. The report also said that [[Bruno Heller]], known for his work on HBO's ''Rome'', was attached as potential showrunner.<ref name="Deadline" />

On March 9, 2022, [[George R.R. Martin]] himself gave an update that the project was proceeding well:

:''"Bruno Heller, the creator and showrunner of ROME, is writing his pilot script for the Corlys Velaryon series. That one started out as NINE VOYAGES, but now we’re calling it THE SEA SNAKE, since we wanted to avoid having two shows with numbers in the title [the other being ''[[Ten Thousand Ships]]]."''<ref name="GRRM">[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/09/random-updates-and-bits-o-news/ Random Updates and Bits o’ News,] GRRM, Not A Blog, March 9, 2022</ref>

This confirms that the project has advanced from the "pitch" phase to the pilot script phase, though it remains to be seen whether HBO will order a pilot to be filmed based on it.

Due to Startling Inc. removing ''The Sea Snake'' from their development list in October 2022, it was speculated that the series had been quietly rejected.<ref>https://wikiofthrones.com/hbo-cancels-game-of-thrones-spinoffs</ref> In December 2022, George R.R. Martin confirmed that some projects had been shelved, but did not specify which.<ref>https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/12/28/stuff-and-nonsense-4/</ref> In April 2023, he stated that ''The Sea Snake'' is still in development.<ref>[https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2023/04/14/a-knight-and-a-squire/ George R.R. Martin | Not A Blog | A Knight and a Squire, April 14, 2023]</ref>

On December 31, 2023, Martin revealed that the series had developed into an animated project, referring to it as ''Nine Voyages''.<ref name="Animation" />
