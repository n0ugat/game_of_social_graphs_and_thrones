==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Over a meal, [[Robert Baratheon]] and [[Eddard Stark]] recall the names of several women they knew when they were younger. Robert recalls one woman whom he believes to be the mother of Eddard's [[bastard]] son [[Jon Snow]], and Eddard confirms her name was "Wylla". The same as the first and only time they discuss it, Eddard refuses to tell Robert what she looked like. Robert tells Eddard not to be too hard on himself as they were at war and could have died at any time.{{Ref|GOT102}}

Jon says Eddard never told him who his mother was, or if his mother is still alive. Eddard had earlier promised Jon that he would talk to him about his mother the next time they met,{{Ref|GOT102}} although Eddard's subsequent beheading made that impossible.{{Ref|GOT109}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Watching Jon training his men in the practice yard of [[Castle Black]], [[Selyse Baratheon]] dismisses him, opining that he is just the bastard son of some tavern slut that Eddard encountered. [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], however, says he doubts that. Having known Eddard personally, he says it really wasn't the way of the honorable Ned Stark to frequent prostitutes the way that Stannis's own brother King Robert did.{{Ref|GOT504}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
With the [[Sight]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] discovers that Jon is not Ned Stark's son at all - he is actually [[Lyanna Stark]]'s son, fathered by [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], her [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|alleged kidnapper]], and born in the [[Tower of Joy]] while Ned and [[Howland Reed]] [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy|fought the last two Targaryen loyalists]]. This revelation does not debunk Wylla's existence, but she is certainly not Jon's mother.{{Ref|GOT610}}

==Behind the scenes==
The ''Game of Thrones'' Viewer's Guide lists "Wylla" as Jon Snow's mother.{{Guideref|Viewer's Guide}}

The question [[George R.R. Martin]] posed to [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] at their first meeting to test their knowledge of the series was "Who do you think Jon Snow's mother is?" Benioff guessed correctly.<ref>Tapper, Jake (March 28, 2013). [http://thelead.blogs.cnn.com/2013/03/28/web-exclusive-game-of-thrones-co-creator-on-gaining-george-r-r-martins-trust Game of Thrones co-creator on gaining George R.R. Martin's trust] CNN.</ref>

Martin has stated that he does already know who Jon's mother is and she will eventually be revealed.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/Many_Questions2/ So Spake Martin, June 13, 2001]</ref> He has told some of the cast members secrets about their characters which have not been revealed in his novels yet, however he has only revealed things which their characters would logically know already. [[Kit Harington]] has said that Martin therefore did not tell him who Jon's mother is because his character does not know.

Harington says he prefers not to think too much about the various theories of his character's parentage as Jon has come to accept that he will never learn the truth about his mother's identity.<ref>Borgo, Érico (April 23, 2012).

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Wylla has been a servant of [[House Dayne]] of [[Starfall]] for many years. 

A member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], young Edric "Ned" Dayne (the new head of House Dayne) tells [[Arya Stark|Arya]] that Wylla was his wet-nurse at Starfall, and that she previously also nursed Jon (who is about four years older than Edric). He doesn't know how or in what circumstances Wylla met Eddard, because he was born a few years after Eddard and Jon left, and no one ever said more about it. Wylla was therefore alive for some time after Jon's birth, but it is unknown if she is still alive.

The novels make the mystery of Wylla truly being Jon's mother more overt than in the TV series. Jon is repeatedly noted for his striking physical resemblance to Ned at a young age, more so than any of Ned's trueborn sons - thus no one denies that Jon must have Stark blood in him.

Throughout the course of the novels, many characters mention rumors about other women who could be Jon's mother, or speculate about it themselves. [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] herself heard maidservants discussing the rumor that Jon's mother was [[Ashara Dayne]] of Starfall - Edric's own aunt, not just a servant. Ashara's brother was [[Arthur Dayne]] of the [[Kingsguard]], whom Ned and his allies killed in the final confrontation of the war, a [[skirmish at the Tower of Joy]]. Afterwards Ned returned the Dayne ancestral sword [[Dawn]] to Starfall out of respect, at which Ashara unexpectedly committed suicide by throwing herself off a cliff into the sea. The rumor was that Ashara didn't simply kill herself because her brother died in war (which happens to many women), but out of grief that her own lover had killed him. Catelyn asked Eddard about Ashara and Jon once early in their marriage: it was the only time Eddard ever truly became angry at her and frightened Catelyn. He said nothing, but commanded her never to ask about Ashara or about the identity of Jon's mother ever again, and indeed she never did afterwards. When Ned confronts Cersei, she also names Ashara as Jon's mother, asking if Ashara committed suicide because Ned killed her brother or stole her son. Even so this was only one of the more prominent of several rumors about the identity of Jon's mother. Others say that she was a fisherman's daughter in the Vale, where Eddard had been staying as a [[ward]] of [[Jon Arryn]] when the war broke out, and that he fathered Jon on her as he was fleeing back to the North to raise its armies after [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] killed his father and brother.

As in the TV series, the only woman that Ned himself ever identifies as Jon's mother is "Wylla" - only once, when Robert asked, and Eddard isn't in a position to refuse his king an answer. Ned also tells Robert that he does not want to discuss Wylla any further with him since his adultery was his dishonor towards himself and his wife.

Following the revelation in the Season 6 finale of the TV series that Jon's parents were actually Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, it is unclear what role Wylla played in the events surrounding his birth. However, Wylla ''is'' confirmed to be a real person, in service to House Dayne. After leaving the Tower of Joy with the infant Jon, Eddard did first travel to House Dayne's castle-seat at Starfall, to return their ancestral sword Dawn which he took from Arthur Dayne after he died in their skirmish. Edric Dayne adamantly insisted that Wylla was a wetnurse to the infant Jon: apparently, Ned hired Wylla as a wetnurse and stayed at Starfall for some time until the baby Jon was large and strong enough for the long journey to Winterfell - and when pressed for what Jon's mother's name was, Eddard simply gave the name of Jon's ''nurse'', confident that her obscurity, low birth, and geographic distance from Winterfell and King's Landing would protect her from reprisal or investigation.
