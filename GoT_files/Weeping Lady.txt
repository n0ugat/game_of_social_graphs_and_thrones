==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[File:Black and White Weeping Woman full statue.jpg|thumb|Full view of the statue of the Weeping Lady: it holds a bowl in its hands, to collect the falling tears.]]
A statue of the Weeping Lady is among the idols present at the [[House of Black and White]]. The [[Faceless Men]] believe that the Weeping Lady is just one of the "faces" of the [[Many-Faced God]].{{Ref|GOT503}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the statue of the Weeping Lady found in the House of Black and White is called the "Weeping Woman." It is made of marble and is 12 feet tall. It is commonly visited by old women.

The [[Lord of Light]] religion is the largest in Lys, though numerous other local cults exist in sizable numbers. Aside from the Weeping Lady, a local love goddess is also very popular - so much that it is printed on Lysene coins, naked and wanton. It isn't clear if the love goddess and the Weeping Lady are part of the same religion or are from separate cults.
