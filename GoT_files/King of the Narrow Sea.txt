'''King of the Narrow Sea'''{{Ref|HOTD104}} was a title given to [[Daemon Targaryen]] after the [[siege of Bloodstone]] during the [[War for the Stepstones]]. Daemon held the title from [[115 AC]]{{Dateref|Second of His Name}} until he abdicated in [[116 AC]],{{Dateref|King of the Narrow Sea}} officially surrendering the [[Stepstones]] to his brother [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Daemon's full title is "King of the [[Stepstones]] and the [[Narrow Sea]]." It was he himself who created this title in 109 AC after conquering most of the Stepstones (all but two islands), and [[Corlys Velaryon]] crowned him. In 111 AC, he returned to [[King's Landing]] and surrendered his crown to [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]. However, they were estranged again only half a year later, prompting Daemon to resume his warmongering in the Stepstones. He left the Stepstones once more in 115 AC to attempt to claim [[Runestone]] after hearing of the death of his estranged wife [[Rhea Royce]]. He never again returned to the islands, however, as he had grown tired of them, instead preferring to tour the [[Free Cities]] with his new wife [[Laena Velaryon]].
