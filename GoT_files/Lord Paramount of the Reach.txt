'''Lord Paramount of the Reach''',{{Ref|GOT806}} or simply the '''Lord of the Reach''',{{Ref|GOT804}} is a title held by the [[Great House]] of the [[Reach]].

[[House Tyrell]] traditionally held the title since the death of [[Mern IX Gardener]] and the [[Field of Fire|extinction]] of his [[House Gardener|House]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]], when [[Harlen Tyrell]], the [[Steward]] of [[Highgarden]], bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror, but all prominent members of the house were killed after the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]] and the [[Sack of Highgarden]].

Ser [[Bronn]] of the Blackwater later offers to join [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]] with the forces of Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]], rather than assassinate them, should he be named [[Lord of Highgarden]], a deal to which Tyrion reluctantly agrees.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref>

After the [[Battle of King's Landing]] and a subsequent [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]], Bronn was named to the position by [[Bran Stark|Brandon Stark]], the newly crowned [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms|Lord of the Six Kingdoms]]. He was additionally named [[Master of Coin]], the post held by his predecessor [[Mace Tyrell]].<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the title High Marshal of the Reach is also claimed by House Tyrell. ''The World of Ice & Fire'' states that the title of Lord Paramount is actually Lord Paramount of the Mander as well, rather than being of the Reach. However, as this was not stated within the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' series itself, it has not been translated into the TV series.
