'''Caleotte'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[Order of Maesters|maester]] in service to [[House Martell]] at the [[Water Gardens]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Caleotte delivers a [[raven]] scroll bearing news of [[Prince]]ss [[Myrcella Baratheon]]'s death to [[Doran Martell]]. [[Tyene Sand]] and [[Ellaria Sand]] choose this moment to [[assassin]]ate Doran and [[Areo Hotah]]. Obviously having not been complicit to the Sands' [[Coup in Dorne|coup]], Caleotte attempts to flee. After killing Areo, Tyene throws a dagger into the maester's back, killing him.{{Ref|GOT601}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Maester Caleotte attends to Prince Doran at [[Sunspear]], and travels with him whenever he vacations at the Water Gardens. He is long accustomed to treating Doran's gout, and designed the wheelchair that he uses.

His appearance in the show partly resembles his description in the books, having a shaven head, smooth cheeks, and wearing dun colored robes. Unlike in the show, he is fat, has soft pink hands and is no more than five feet tall.

Maester Caleotte serves also as Doran's advisor. After hearing [[Obara Sand|Obara]]'s plan of revenge, Caleotte suggests it may not be prudent to allow Obara to return to Sunspear, because she is certain to inflame the [[Smallfolk|common people]]. Doran agrees with the maester and returns to Sunspear, where he orders to arrest the [[Sand Snakes]], to prevent them from stirring troubles.

Maester Caleotte takes precautions to protect his prince: after Doran caresses Tyene's head, Caleotte examines his palm, looking for scratches that may indicate poisoning.

Following the near-fatal attempt on Myrcella by [[Knighthood|Ser]] Gerold "Darkstar" [[House Dayne|Dayne]], Maester Caleotte saves her life but cannot heal her disfigured face.

Maester Caleotte is present when Ser [[Balon Swann]] presents the skull of [[Gregor Clegane]] to Doran, Ellaria, and the Sand Snakes.

So far in the books, he is alive.
