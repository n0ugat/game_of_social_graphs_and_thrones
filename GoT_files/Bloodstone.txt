==History==

=== [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|House of the Dragon Season 1]] ===
Bloodstone as the largest island it became the centre of [[Triarchy]] forces. Corlys and Daemon launch their war, but after three years, it has descended into attrition and guerrilla warfare, with the Triarchy forces hiding in caves in the island to hide from the Targaryen and Velaryon dragons before driving them off with arrows. After Viserys relents and sends 10 ships with 2,000 men to aid them and a message beforehand, the forces launch a siege on the island of Bloodstone, where Daemon kills the [[Craghas Drahar|Crabfeeder]].<ref>''[[House of the Dragon]]'': [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]], Episode 3: "[[Second of His Name]]" (2022).</ref>
