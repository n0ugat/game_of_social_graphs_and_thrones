After Ser [[Criston Cole]] is named [[Hand of the King]] by King [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], he assembles a [[Greens|Targaryen]]-[[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightower]] army in [[King's Landing]] and marches north on the [[Rosby Road]], with the objective of forcing the submission of all the noble houses of the [[Crownlands]] to the Greens' cause. During their march to [[Rosby]], Criston's army is spotted and harassed by [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] atop [[Moondancer]]. Subsequently, Criston began marching his army solely at night to exploit the treecover and mask his movements from the [[Blacks]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}

===Aftermath===
With the forces of Houses Rosby added to the Green army, Criston and his forces marched for [[Castle Stokeworth]]. There, [[House Stokeworth]] also [[Submission of Stokeworth|submits]] to Criston's army without a fight.{{Ref|HOTD204}}
