==Narration==
'''Bran Stark''': ''The [[House Stark|Starks]] of [[Winterfell]] trace their descent to the [[First Men]] in the [[Age of Heroes]].''

''The family's founder was [[Brandon the Builder]] who, in the aftermath of the [[Long Night]], helped establish the [[Night's Watch]].''

''Legend has it, he enlisted the aid of [[giants]] and the powerful [[magic]] of the [[Children of the Forest]] to raise the mighty [[Wall]], which has protected the realm for generations.''

''He went on to build the ancestral seat of Winterfell and reigned as the first [[King in the North]].''

'''Robb Stark''': ''The Starks reigned as kings for thousands of years, even withstanding the [[Coming of the Andals|invasion]] of the [[Andals]]. As the southern kingdoms fell, and the Children were driven away, the [[North]] stood strong, maintaining its religious customs and its way of life.''

''Eventually, the reign of the Kings of Winter came to an end with the [[Aegon's Conquest|coming]] of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. After Aegon and his [[dragon]]s destroyed the armies of the [[Reach]] and the [[Westerlands|Rock]] at the [[Field of Fire]], King [[Torrhen Stark]] [[bending the knee|bent the knee]] and swore fealty to the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] in order to spare the destruction of Winterfell and [[Northmen|his people]].''

''He was forever after known as "the King Who Knelt." As a reward for his submission, Aegon named Torrhen [[Lord of Winterfell]] and [[Warden of the North]].''

'''Bran Stark''': ''The Starks take great pride in their history and traditions. It is one of the few noble houses that still keeps the [[Old Gods]]; a sacred [[weirwood]] lives large in Winterfell's [[godswood]].''

''Its ancestral sword, [[Ice]], was forged in ancient [[Old Valyria|Valyria]] and passed down through the generations. House Stark remains steadfast in its support of the [[Night's Watch]], even as the once illustrious order has fallen on hard times.''

''Much like their sigil, the grey [[direwolf]], House Stark is the stuff of legend in the North and throughout the [[Seven Kingdoms]]...''

'''Bran and Robb Stark''': ''...and their family words, "Winter Is Coming" serve as a reminder of their beginnings...''

'''Robb Stark''': ''...in the wake of the Long Night and a grim portent of things to come.''
