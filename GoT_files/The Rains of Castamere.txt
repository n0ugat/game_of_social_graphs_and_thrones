"'''The Rains of Castamere'''"{{Ref|GOT308}} is an infamous song in [[Westeros]], dedicated to [[Tywin Lannister]] in particular and [[House Lannister]] in general.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:ReyneRebellion.png|thumb|The red lion of Reyne confronts the golden lion of Lannister.]]
"The Rains of Castamere" immortalized the destruction of [[House Reyne]] by [[Tywin Lannister]]. House Reyne was obliterated after they [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt|rebelled]] against their liege lord [[Tytos Lannister]], who was perceived as weak by his own vassals. To restore [[House Lannister|Lannister]] dominance, Tytos's son, Tywin, marched against the upstart [[Lord of Castamere]], [[Roger Reyne]]. By the end of the rebellion, [[Castamere]] had been put to the torch and all members of House Reyne were [[Execution|executed]]. The title is thus a play on words, as the "rains" fall over the empty halls of the "Reynes" who had been killed to the last man.{{Ref|H&L123}}

The lyrics heavily reference the fact that the [[Heraldry|sigil]] of House Reyne was also a red [[lion]], in contrast to the golden lion used as the sigil of House Lannister. The rebellion of the Reynes against the Lannisters was therefore seen as a clash of lions.{{Cite}}

In the decades since young Tywin reasserted House Lannister's dominance by crushing the Reynes, "The Rains of Castamere" went on to become very popular with [[Man-at-arms|soldiers]] of the [[Westerlands]], becoming an "anthem" of sorts for House Lannister. This extends to the point that western soldiers sometimes refer to it simply as, "the Lannister song".{{Ref|GOT209}}

[[Bronn]] and a number of Lannister men-at-arms sing the song while drinking and [[Prostitution|whoring]] prior to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. When they ask how he came to know "the Lannister song" he simply replies, "Drunk Lannisters."{{Ref|GOT209}}

[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] is the only one present who recognizes the tune, but by the time she realizes what is happening, it is already far too late.{{Ref|GOT309}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Soundtrack Season 2.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The song appears on the Season 2 soundtrack album.]]
The version used in the TV series' soundtrack was recorded by the American indie rock band [[The National]], and appears on ''[[Game of Thrones: Season 2 (Music from the HBO Series)]]'', as well as over the closing credits for the episode "[[Blackwater]]".{{Ref|GOT209}} Originally producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] wanted British band [[Florence + The Machine]] to perform the song, but they were busy. The National were their second choice.

The lyrics are provided by the original novel. Show composer [[Ramin Djawadi]] wrote the tune before the National came in and played their own interpretation of it.<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/game-of-thrones-behind-the-music.html Vulture]</ref>

The song is the basis of the [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#House Lannister theme|Lannisters' leitmotif]] in the series' soundtrack.

Icelandic post-rock band [[Sigur Rós]] have recorded a version of the song for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth season]].<ref>[http://wicnet.tumblr.com/post/81615844354/preview-of-sigur-ross-cover-of-the-rains-of Winter is Coming Tumblr]</ref>

The song was recorded by Armenian-American record producer Serj Tankian for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 8 (Music from the HBO Series)|Season 8 soundtrack]]. It was unused on-screen.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, "The Rains of Castamere" was composed after Tywin]'s victory over their rebellious bannermen: [[House Reyne]] of [[Castamere]] and the ancient House Tarbeck of Tarbeck Hall. Lord Tytos Lannister was a kind but weak ruler. He loaned money to lords who never bothered to repay him and his vassals openly ignored his orders and mocked him in court. When Lord Reyne (known as the Red Lion of Castamere) and Lady Ellyn Tarbeck rose in rebellion, Tywin took it upon himself to deal with the rebellion and wiped out both of the upstart lords, their families and households and put their seats of power to the torch.

Some years later after the extinction of House Reyne when Lord Farman of Faircastle grew truculent, Lord Tywin sent an envoy bearing a lute instead of a letter to play "The Rains of Castamere" in Farman's hall, and the latter gave no further trouble.

In the novels, "The Rains of Castamere" and its story (as above) are first mentioned in Chapter 19 of Volume 3, [http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/A_Storm_of_Swords A Storm of Swords]. The full lyrics are first provided in Chapter 39 of the same volume, recited by the singer Tom of Sevenstreams of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|Brotherhood]]; the TV show uses that lyric without alteration.

During the [[Second siege of Riverrun|siege of Riverrun]], Tom of Sevenstreams (a member of the Brotherhood) plays the song in order to clarify to Edmure that Jaime's threats are not idle, thus make him more willing to accept the surrender terms.
