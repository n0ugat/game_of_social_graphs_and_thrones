The '''Jade Gates'''<ref>[[:File:HotD Far East Map.jpg]]</ref> are a strait separating the [[Jade Sea]] and the [[Summer Sea]] south of [[Qarth]] and north of [[Great Moraq]]. [[Corlys Velaryon]] passed through the Jade Gates during one of his nine voyages.<ref>[[:File:HotD Nine Voyages Map.png]]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Jade Gates are a major trade hub controlled by Qarth, who began patrolling it with a fleet of ornate galleys after the [[Valyrian Freehold]] fell. It is the main contributor to the city's immense wealth and power.

Corlys Velaryon was the first known [[Westeros]]i to ever sail through the Jade Gates.
