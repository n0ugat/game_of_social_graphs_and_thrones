Since 2012, Dave Hill has been credited as assistant for co-executive producers [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] for Seasons 2, 3 and 4.

In 2014, Hill was assigned to write an episode for [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]], alongside [[David Benioff]], [[D.B. Weiss]], and [[Bryan Cogman]].<ref>"[http://gameofowns.com/episode-219-bryan-cogman-returns/]"</ref>

In August 2014, a report in ''Variety'' explained how Hill was promoted to an episode writer in Season 5:

:"We had an assistant named Dave Hill," said Benioff and Weiss. "One day last summer he walked into our office and said, 'You know that kid ([[Olly]]) whose family gets massacred by the wildlings? The one who runs to [[Castle Black]] to let them know the wildlings are nearby?' 'Yeah?' 'Well,' said Dave, doesn't it make sense that he'd stay at Castle Black and become a [[Night's Watch]] recruit? Where else is he going to go?' 'You're right,' we said. 'That does make sense.' 'And what if during the [[Battle for the Wall|battle for Castle Black]], he's the one who ends up killing [[Ygritte]]?' This year, Dave Hill is a writer on the show."<ref>"[http://variety.com/gallery/photos-showrunners-impact-report/#!13/david-benioff-d-b-weiss/ ]</ref>
