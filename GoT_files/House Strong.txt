In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, some alleged descendants of House Strong live in exile in the [[Free Cities]].{{Bookref|ADWD|24}}

Ser Osmund Strong was the fourth Hand of the King, being named to the position by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] in 17 AC after the death of Alton Celtigar.{{Bookref|F&B|3}} He died in 34 AC and was succeeded by Alyn Stokeworth.{{Bookref|F&B|4}}

Ser Lucamore Strong, known as "Lucamore the Lusty," was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of the [[Kingsguard]] during the reign of Jaehaerys I who broke the Kingsguard vows of chastity by secretly [[Marriage|marrying]] three women and fathering sixteen children. His sworn brothers discovered this and informed the [[king]], who then had the Kingsguard [[Eunuch|geld]] Lucamore and sent him to the [[Wall]] to join the [[Night's Watch]]. All of his children were deemed [[bastard]]s, and were ordered to bear the surnames Rivers, Waters, and Storm before being relocated to Harrenhal, [[Driftmark]], and [[Storm's End]].{{Bookref|F&B|10}}{{Bookref|F&B|11}}

Ser Bywin Strong was named Lord of Harrenhal in 73 AC by King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] following the death of the dowager queen [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena]], who had taken up residence there and unofficially ruled as Lady of Harrenhal.{{Bookref|F&B|10}} By 105 AC Lyonel Strong was the Lord of Harrenhal, but his exact relation to Bywin is unknown.{{Bookref|F&B|12}}

Lyonel served as master of laws, and later Hand of the King following the dismissal of [[Otto Hightower]]. He and his firstborn son Harwin Breakbones died in a mysterious fire at Harrenhal after Harwin had been sent away from King's Landing due to the growing rumor that he had fathered three bastards on Princess Rhaenyra, passed off as the trueborn sons of Laenor Velaryon. Three main culprits were suspected of having caused the fire: [[Daemon Targaryen]], to eliminate a rival for Rhaenyra's affections; [[Corlys Velaryon]], as revenge for his son being cuckolded; or Harwin's own younger brother Larys, to claim the lordship of Harrenhal. Others simply blamed the event on the legendary curse of Harrenhal.{{Bookref|F&B|12}}

House Strong had grown wealthy by the time of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], and Larys Strong was a leading figure of the [[greens]], serving on the [[Green Council|green council]] as [[Master of Whisperers|master of whisperers]] and Lord Confessor. His great-uncle Simon Strong held Harrenhal as castellan in his stead during this time.{{Bookref|F&B|13}}

Although House Strong is considered extinct,{{Bookref|AFFC|22}} during the time span of the events described in ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels there are three known characters whose surname is Strong:
*Duncan Strong, an [[exile]] serving with the [[Golden Company]].{{Bookref|ADWD|24}}
*Denys Strong, an exile serving with the Golden Company.{{Bookref|ADWD|24}}
*Ser Robert Strong, a knight of the Kingsguard under [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen I Baratheon]]. Presumed to be [[Gregor Clegane]], reanimated by the disgraced maester [[Qyburn]].{{Bookref|ADWD|72}}

It is uncertain whether the aforementioned Duncan and Denys actually belong to House Strong, because in the free companies a man can call himself whatever he chooses;{{Bookref|ADWD|24}} in the case of Robert Strong, it is undoubtedly an assumed name.

In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', it is revealed that the Strongs boast descent from the [[First Men]].{{Bookref|F&B|16}} Their name is a typical example of First Men naming conventions, in which surnames are usually single words that may describe the house founder's appearance, personality, or occupation.
