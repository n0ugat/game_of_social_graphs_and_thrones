==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Gael was born in 80 AC. She was called the "Winter Child," according to some due to the fact that she was born during the winter, and according to others because the queen was in "the winter of her childbearing years." She was considered to be simpleminded and frail. She followed her mother everywhere, and slept in her bed.

In 99 AC, Gael disappeared. It was said officially that she had died of a summer fever, but after the king and queen died, it was revealed that she had drowned herself after giving birth to a stillborn son fathered by a traveling singer.
