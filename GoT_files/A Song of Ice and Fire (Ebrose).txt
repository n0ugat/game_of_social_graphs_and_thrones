'''''A Song of Ice and Fire''''',{{Ref|GOT806}} formerly titled '''''A Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert I''''',{{Ref|GOT702}} is a book detailing the events of the [[War of the Five Kings]] and the [[Last War]] after the death of King [[Robert Baratheon]]. The book is written by [[Archmaester]] [[Ebrose]] with the assistance of [[Samwell Tarly]], who came up with the title. This is the first book written by an archmaester that presents the [[bastard]]y of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and [[Tommen Baratheon]] as fact, along with the [[incest]] of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister]].<ref name="Famtree">[https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/season-8-episode-6-series-finale-props-song-of-ice-and-fire/ The Making of ''Game of Thrones'': A ''Song of Ice and Fire'' prop, Lannister family tree]</ref>
