{{Quote|I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.|Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]]|The Kingsroad}}
'''Hallis Mollen'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was the new captain of the guard at [[Winterfell]] after the departure of [[Jory Cassel]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] suggests to [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] that if she is heading south to capture [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], she should take "Hal" and a squad of guardsmen with her. Catelyn declines, pointing out that too large of a traveling party will attract unwanted attention. Instead, Catelyn only allows Rodrik himself to accompany her.{{Ref|GOT102}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Hallis Mollen is Jory Cassel's replacement as captain of the guard at Winterfell, after Jory travels with [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] to King's Landing. He is muscular and has a square brown beard. He has a loose tongue and tendency to state the obvious.

In the books, following Ned's arrest, Hallis goes south with [[Robb Stark]]'s army and takes part in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood|battle in the Whispering Wood]]. Later he accompanies Catelyn south when she goes to treat with [[Renly Baratheon]] at [[Storm's End]]. After Catelyn receives Ned's bones at [[Riverrun]], she orders Hallis to escort them back to Winterfell for proper burial in the crypts. What happened to Hallis's party is unknown, except that they never reached their destination.

In the TV series, Ned's bones are delivered instead by [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], at Tyrion's request, at Renly's camp in the [[Stormlands]]. In "[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]," Jon says "We're going to bury [[Rickon Stark|my brother]] in the crypt next to my father" - indicating that Ned's bones have been brought to Winterfell and buried in the crypts.
