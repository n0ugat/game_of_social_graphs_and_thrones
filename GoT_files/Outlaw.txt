An '''outlaw'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is an individual that has defied the [[Laws and customs|laws of the realm]] and the "King's peace" and are thus outside the protection of the law. A similar term, but with a more negative connotation, is '''brigand'''.{{Ref|GOT106}}

Outlaws tend to form bands or "brotherhoods" for protection and to avoid capture.
