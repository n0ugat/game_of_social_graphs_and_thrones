===Notes===
*At least 1 of 25 starring cast members appears in this episode.

==Behind the scenes==
*This is the seventh episode directed by [[Clare Kilner]] for ''House of the Dragon,'' making her one of only four directors to date who have done seven or more episodes for the ''[[World of Westeros]]'' franchise. The other three directors are [[Miguel Sapochnik]], [[Alan Taylor]], and [[David Nutter]] - all of whom (as of 2025) are in a three-way tie for most episodes, with each having directed nine episodes in total.
**Sapochnik and Taylor reached a total of nine episodes across both ''Game of Thrones'' and ''House of the Dragon'': Sapochnik did six on the first and three on the second, Taylor did seven on the first and two on the second. Nutter's nine episodes were all on ''Game of Thrones'' itself, which is the current record for most episodes within a specific TV series (of course, ''Game of Thrones'' ran for a full eight seasons compared to a projected four seasons for the prequel series). 
**Kilner is directing a total of three episodes in Season 3, which combined with the five she directed in prior seasons brings her to a total of eight. If she returns for Season 4, she will match if not break the record as most prolific director in the franchise.
**Kilner is all but guaranteed to be the most prolific director specifically on ''House of the Dragon'' if Season 4 is indeed the final season. By the end of Season 3, no other director will have done more than three episodes compared to Kilner's eight. Therefore even if Kilner ultimately does not return for Season 4, another director would have to do an unprecedented ''five'' episodes in a single season to even match her current record on it. 
**Following the departure of [[Geeta Vasant Patel|Geeta Patel]] after Season 2, Kilner is also the only director from ''House of the Dragon'' Season 1 who worked on all three current seasons of the series. Sapochnik and [[Greg Yaitanes]] did not return for Seasons 2 or 3, though Season 2's new directors [[Loni Peristere]] and [[Andrij Parekh]] did return for Season 3. 
**If Kilner returns for Season 4, she will also break the record for most ''consecutive'' seasons. Due to the massive scale of ''Game of Thrones'' few directors ever did three consecutive seasons, and particularly directors like Taylor and Sapochnik who handled major battle sequences would also need to go on a longer break afterwards. Taylor directed on ''Game of Thrones'' Seasons 1, 2, and 7 (and later ''House of the Dragon'' Season 2); Sapochnik directed on Seasons 5, 6, and 8 (and then ''House of the Dragon'' Season 1); Nutter directed on Seasons 2, 3, 5, and 8. Only three directors ever did three consecutive seasons before: both [[Mark Mylod]] and [[Jeremy Podeswa]] directed six episodes each across Seasons 5, 6, and 7, and [[Alik Sakharov]] directed four episodes across Seasons 2, 3, and 4 (Sakharov also worked on Season 1 but was only as a cinematographer, not a full director). Thus as of ''House of the Dragon'' Season 3, Kilner is now in a four-way tie for director who has worked on the most consecutive series.
