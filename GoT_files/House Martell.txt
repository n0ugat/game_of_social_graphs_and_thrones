{{Quote|'Unbowed, unbent, unbroken.' The words of House Martell. A promise to our enemies, and a challenge to our lovers.|[[Oberyn Martell]]|House Martell (short)}}
'''House Martell'''{{Ref|GOT105}} of [[Sunspear]] is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. It rules the peninsula of [[Dorne]] in the far south of the continent. Though loyal to the [[Iron Throne]], the Martells were never [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered]] by the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] and have pursued a more isolated role in wider political events since [[Robert's Rebellion]].

With the [[Coup in Dorne|assassinations]] of Prince [[Doran Martell]] and his only heir, Prince [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]], by [[Ellaria Sand]] and the three eldest [[Sand Snakes]], the Sand Snakes carry the Martell blood through their father [[Oberyn Martell]]. The Sand Snakes also continue to use the Martell sigil to represent themselves and Dorne.<ref name="E60">"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

Under the leadership of Ellaria Sand, the forces of House Martell and Dorne were aligned with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] against [[House Lannister]].

Following the deaths of Ellaria and the three eldest Sand Snakes, a [[Prince of Dorne (Last War)|Martell]] rises to power as the new [[Prince of Dorne]].

House Martell's [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a red sun pierced by a golden spear, on an orange field, a combination of the original Martell sigil - a yellow spear - and the emblem of Princess [[Nymeria]] - a red sun - to symbolize the marriage of the warrior-queen to [[Mors Martell]]. Their [[house words]] are "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken."<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

==History==
===Background===
[[File:H&L401.png|thumb|Nymeria led the Rhoynar refugee fleet in a massive migration to Dorne, fleeing the Valyrians.]]
House Martell started out as local [[king]]s in Dorne, which was long divided between many petty kings of the [[First Men]] and [[Andals]]. About a thousand years ago, [[Rhoynar]] refugees [[Rhoynish Wars|fleeing conquest]] by the [[Valyrian Freehold]] in [[Essos]] migrated across the [[Narrow Sea]] to Dorne, led by their warrior-queen [[Nymeria]]. [[Mors Martell]] was smitten with Nymeria and chose to join forces with her through marriage-alliance. With their combined strength, they [[Nymeria's War|conquered and unified the rest of Dorne]]. To symbolize their union, the original golden spear sigil of Mors Martell was combined with the red sun sigil of Nymeria, creating the red sun pierced by a golden spear sigil that House Martell has used as a sigil ever since. Like their Rhoynar ancestors, House Martell styled its rulers as "princes" instead of "kings", and kept using the titles, resisting the Targaryen invasion and keeping local laws and traditions even after joining the Seven Kingdoms after a matrimonial alliance.
[[File:Dorne resists the Targaryen Conquest.png|thumb|The Martells resisted the Targaryen conquest by resorting to guerrilla warfare: if a dragon came the Dornish hid in the desert until it left, then ambushed the Targaryens' supply lines, until they eventually withdrew.]]
The Martell words are "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken" - referring to their history, in which they have never been successfully conquered by outsiders. This makes them unique among all of the Great Houses. During [[Aegon's Conquest]] (three centuries before the War of the Five Kings), Dorne was the only region of the Seven Kingdoms to successfully resist the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] and their [[dragon]]s. Realizing that large armies could not stand against dragons (as seen at the [[Field of Fire]]), nor large castles (as seen at the [[Burning of Harrenhal]]), the Dornish instead resorted to guerrilla warfare, ambushing Targaryen soldiers and harassing their supply lines as soon as their dragons moved on to the next castle, then disappearing back into the harsh deserts when the dragons returned. The Dornish armies took advantage of Dorne's arid climate, which helped them to adopt attrition warfare against the invading Targaryens, as the arid climate and harsh wastelands of Dorne cannot easily support large invading armies. Losing many men due to attrition, ultimately even [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] decided to withdraw from Dorne, to focus on reining in the other six newly conquered kingdoms.  
[[File:Daeron's death.png|thumb|King [[Daeron I Targaryen]]'s invasion of Dorne lasted only 4 years, ending with the death of Daeron I, along with 60,000 of his men, and the Martells still defiantly independent.]]
House Martell and Dorne have never been ''successfully'' conquered. Over a century and a half after the Targaryen Conquest of the rest of Westeros, they were invaded again by King [[Daeron I Targaryen]], the Young Dragon. A military genius, his [[Conquest of Dorne]] actually succeeded - on the battlefield. But the initial conquest was followed by a four year long Dornish insurgency, in which occupying troops were again bled through ambush and guerrilla tactics. [[Lyonel Tyrell]], the steward that Daeron I put in charge of Dorne, was then assassinated, and all of Dorne rose up in open rebellion. Daeron I himself was killed attempting to put down the insurrection, and after only four short years House Martell once again ruled an independent Dorne.  
[[File:Targaryen Martell two marriages.png|thumb|The double marriage-alliance that united the Martells with the Iron Throne: King [[Daeron II Targaryen]] married Prince [[Maron Martell]]'s sister [[Myriah Martell|Myriah]] (left), and Prince Maron married Daeron II's sister [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys]] (right).]]
A few decades later (a little over a century before the War of the Five Kings), King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II the Good]] managed to finally unite Dorne with the [[Iron Throne]] - not through conquest, but by voluntary marriage-alliance on equal terms. Daeron II married [[Myriah Martell|the sister]] of the Prince of Dorne, and the Prince of Dorne married [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daeron II's sister]]. This special, semi-autonomous status allowed Dorne to retain several special privileges, such as the Martells continuing to style themselves as "Prince" or "Princess" instead of "Lord Paramount" and continuing their practice of gender-blind primogeniture. This union did cause several political tensions at the royal court between Daeron II's pro-Martell faction and anti-Martell lords (from the Reach, the Stormlands, and the [[Dornish Marches]]), eventually leading to the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]].  
[[File:Slaughter.png|thumb|At the end of Robert's Rebellion, Lannister bannerman [[Gregor Clegane]] killed [[Elia Martell]]'s children, then raped and killed Elia.]]
Generations later, King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] (later known as "the Mad King") had no daughters, so he sought a suitable bride for his son Crown Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] from outside of the family. Aerys II chose to snub the offer of [[Tywin Lannister]], his own trusted [[Hand of the King]] and dutiful servant, that Rhaegar marry his own young daughter [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Instead, a match was arranged with the then-current Princess of Dorne to wed her daughter [[Elia Martell]] to Rhaegar.

In [[Robert's Rebellion]], Elia was kept in King's Landing to ensure the continued allegiance of House Martell to the Targaryen's against the rebels. Elia bore Rhaegar two children, but all three were later killed during [[Robert's Rebellion]], during the [[Sack of King's Landing]] by Tywin's army. Elia's brothers Doran and [[Oberyn Martell|Oberyn]] were outraged and, while peace was restored, the Martells withdrew from interacting with the royal court. During King [[Robert Baratheon]]'s subsequent reign, the Martells and Dorne were rarely if ever even mentioned at court, except for their Dornish wine.

{{Quote|After the tradition of her people, House Martell then ruled Dorne as 'princes', not 'kings' - unless the eldest child was a daughter, for unlike the rest of Westeros, our loyalty isn't commanded by a cock.  We follow a Prince or a Princess Martell just the same.|[[Oberyn Martell]]|House Martell (short)}}[[File:Nymeria and Mors Martell.png|thumb|[[Mors Martell]] and [[Nymeria]] united to conquer and unify Dorne. Afterwards they ruled equally, and were succeeded by their eldest daughter over their younger son - following the gender-blind inheritance customs of the Rhoynar.]]
Like their [[Rhoynar]] ancestors who migrated to Dorne a thousand years ago, Dornish noble houses follow gender-blind equal primogeniture, in which the eldest child is the heir regardless of whether that child is male or female. This is different from the male-preference inheritance laws in all of the rest of the Seven Kingdoms, the laws of the [[First Men]] and [[Andals]], in which a younger son succeeds ahead of an older daughter. In [[House Stark]], for example, [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] are officially ahead of their older sister [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] in the line of succession, and in [[House Lannister]], [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] was officially ahead of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] despite being younger than her.

In contrast, a ruler of House Martell is always succeeded by their eldest child, even if it is a daughter. The current ruler of Dorne (when House Martell is fully introduced in Season 5) is Prince [[Doran Martell]], who has been the head of House Martell for many years. The immediately preceding head of House Martell, however, was Doran's ''mother'', who was also the mother of Elia and Oberyn. Doran's mother actually had a younger brother, [[Lewyn Martell]]. Under the inheritance laws of the rest of Westeros, Lewyn would have succeeded ahead of Doran's mother, but because Dornish inheritance laws are gender-blind he did not (and therefore he was free to join the elite [[Kingsguard]]).

In the style of their Rhoynar ancestors who lived in city-states in Essos (near the location of the later [[Free Cities]]), House Martell styles its rulers as "[[Prince of Dorne]]" (or "Princess") instead of "King" or "Queen". All members of House Martell are called a Prince/Princess, though the current head of the household is the ruling Prince/Princess. There is little functional difference between the "Prince of Dorne" and a "Lord Paramount of the North", though the title "Prince" is considered to be, at least nominally, more prestigious.

Due to uniting with the Iron Throne through marriage-alliance on equal terms instead of through conquest, the Martells were allowed to retain several special privileges, among which were continuing to style their ruler as a "Prince", and continuing to practice gender-blind equal primogeniture.  While many of the Martells are hot-tempered, especially Prince Oberyn, they are a close-knit and loving family, undivided by internal rivalries such as those in House Lannister and House Baratheon.

==Family tree==
{{Martell tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Martell does not play a major role in events until the third and fourth books in the series, only being referenced in the first two.

House Martell was originally a tiny, obscure noble house of Dorne back when the peninsula was home to numerous small, warring states, approximately one thousand years ago. The [[Rhoynar]], refugees from a war against [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]] on the eastern continent, fled to Westeros led by their warrior-queen Nymeria, where they made landfall in Dorne and allied with Lord Mors Martell. After a brief war, Mors named himself the ruler of the unified Kingdom of Dorne, adopting the title "Prince" rather than "King" in Rhoynish fashion. Mors married Nymeria, uniting the bloodlines of the Rhoynar with the native First Men and Andals. As a result, the full name of the family is actually "House Nymeros Martell", with "Nymeros" signifying "of Nymeria". For example, Oberyn's full name is given as "Oberyn Nymeros Martell". However, even the Martells themselves do not usually use the full name, with the inclusion of "Nymeros", except on very formal occasions.

When [[Aegon I Targaryen]] invaded Westeros, he conquered six of the seven kingdoms extant at that time, but the Dornish refused to give open battle where Aegon could destroy them with his [[dragon]]s, instead resorting to hit-and-run attacks which severely damaged his army through attrition. Aegon agreed to leave Dorne to its own devices after trying to conquer it again during the First Dornish War of 4 AC to 13 AC. However, the Dornish once again prevailed and the Martells managed to kill Aegon's wife, Rhaenys, before forcing the Conqueror to agree to peace on their terms. Aegon never tried conquering Dorne again. 

A century and a half later, Dorne was briefly occupied by the armies of King Daeron I, but overthrew them in a bloody rebellion. Eventually, roughly a century before the events of the series, Dorne joined the Seven Kingdoms through a peaceful marriage alliance. House Martell's motto, "Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken", directly references the fact that they were never conquered by outsiders. Because they came under the authority of the Iron Throne through marriage instead of the sword, House Martell and the other Dornish houses continue to practice absolute primogeniture, in which the eldest child is the designated heir, regardless of whether they are male or female. Another major difference is that the rulers of Dorne are styled ruling Princes (or ruling Princesses) instead of Lords Paramount. At the time of the beginning of the narrative the current head of House Martell is the aging Prince Doran. His daughter and eldest child is Arianne Martell: despite being female, she has been actively groomed to succeed her father, as are eldest daughters all over Dorne. In his old age and infirmity (though he retains his wits) Doran has semi-retired, delegating most of the day-to-day governance of Dorne to Arianne. 

The Martells were loyal vassals of the [[Iron Throne]], with Princess Elia Martell marrying Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and bearing him two children. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], the Martells were unhappy with Rhaegar's betrayal of Elia by taking [[Lyanna Stark]] as his paramour and sparking a war over the matter. Still, they supported King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]'s bid to retain the throne, predominantly due to Aerys effectively holding Elia as a hostage to ensure their loyalty. The Martells lost many soldiers at the [[Battle of the Trident]] and Princess Elia and her children were brutally killed during the Sack of [[King's Landing]] by [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers. Ironically, the Martells had only grudgingly stayed loyal to the Targaryens during the civil war, but the needless and brutal murder of Elia turned Dorne into a hotbed of pro-Targaryen sentiment (to the point that, after the Sack of King's Landing, Oberyn had wanted to continue the fighting on behalf of [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]]). Though House Martell swore fealty to King [[Robert Baratheon]] after the war (though this was only due to extensive peace negotiations on the part of [[Jon Arryn]]), they have harbored anger and resentment towards the Lannisters ever since and have adopted a mostly isolationist policy ever since, not mixing with the other Great Houses unless totally necessary. As a result, the Dornish have stronger relations with the Free Cities of Essos than the rest of Westeros.

The Martells and Tyrells have been sworn enemies for many generations. Over the centuries, they have fought border wars beyond count, and raided back and forth across mountains and marches even when at peace. The enmity between the two houses waned a bit after Dorne became part of the Seven Kingdoms, but the maiming of [[Willas Tyrell]] by the Dornish prince Oberyn Martell in a joust fanned the animosity between the families, though Willas himself does not hold any grudge against Oberyn, as both men knew what happened was simply an unfortunate accident.

In the second novel, Varys reports Tyrion that Prince Doran Martell has called his banners, and there are rumors that he intends to join [[Renly Baratheon]] (Renly tells [[Catelyn Stark]] the same thing). Knowing that an alliance between Renly and Dorne will be disastrous to the Lannisters, Tyrion take steps to prevent it by offering Prince Doran to marry Myrcella to Trystane, [[Gregor Clegane|his sister's killer]], a seat at the [[Small Council]], and some castles on the Marches. Despite Cersei's protests, Tyrion sends Myrcella to Dorne as a token of good faith. The Martells stay neutral throughout the war, although it is unclear whether the reason is Tyrion's offer, or the Martells bide their time. 

Tywin, too, understands it is necessary to appease the Martells, lest they form an alliance with [[Stannis Baratheon]]. He is partly correct: as revealed in the fourth and fifth novels, Doran Martell intends to support enemies of House Lannister; the enemies in question, however, are the Targaryens, not the Baratheons.  

Cersei deeply hates the Dornish in general and the Martells in particular, thinking that all Dornishmen are snakes, and the Martells are the worst of them. Her hatred is fueled by the fact that Oberyn fought for Tyrion at the trial-by-combat, and had come within a hairbreadth of a victory that would have allowed Tyrion to escape the blame for Joffrey’s murder. This is perhaps the reason for her unsuccessful scheme to assassinate Trystane. 

In ''A Feast for Crows'', Doran reveals to Arianne that he sent her brother Quentyn to [[Meereen]], to offer a marriage-alliance to Daenerys. Quentyn meets Daenerys in the following novel, but she rejects his offer, because she has already promised to wed [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]. Some time later, after Daenerys departs from Meereen, Quentyn attempts to steal her dragons, but is killed by [[Rhaegal]]. His family has not been informed yet of his death.

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', the presumed-dead [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia, and [[Jon Connington]] arrive at Westeros. Connington believes it is essential to obtain the support of the Martells, because only they have enough power to to defy House Lannister and its allies. For that purpose, he sends Doran a letter, informing him that his nephew is alive, and offering an alliance. Doran, cautious as ever, regards the contents of the letter dubiously; since he prefers not to act till he knows for a certainty what is happening, he sends his daughter Arianne to find out whether Aegon and Connington are really the people whom they claim to be.

While the Martells intend to ally with House Targaryen in general, it has yet to be seen which of the individual Targaryen contenders they will support - Daenerys or Aegon.

[[George R.R. Martin]] has said that the production team was not certain how many members of House Martell they could fit into the TV series. Doran has three children, while Oberyn and Ellaria have eight daughters. Even for House Tyrell, which has four children in the current generation, two have apparently been cut from the TV series (Loras and Margaery's older brothers from the books). Conversely, in Season 2 the production team thought they might have to cut [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s only child, [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]], but subsequently were able to introduce her in Season 3. While Oberyn and Ellaria did appear in Season 4, only [[Trystane Martell]] and three of the [[Sand Snakes]] ([[Obara Sand|Obara]], [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]], and [[Tyene Sand]]) have appeared in the TV series. 

House Martell's name might have been inspired by Charles Martel (Charles the Hammer),{{Cite}} who led the Franks to turn back the Muslim invasion of France at the Battle of Tours in 732.
