The following is a list of '''differences''' between [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]] and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]''. While all the plotlines in the show are ahead of the point the novels reached, there are still many differences between the episodes and the material source.

==Differences by episode==
==="[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"===
*The [[Golden Company]] has not been hired by [[House Lannister]], but by [[Jon Connington]] (aka Griff), the guardian of a new contender who has been omitted from the show - [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]].
*[[Harry Strickland]] is fat and cowardly.
*The Golden Company has 10,000 men, not 20,000.
*More than half of the Golden Company does not reach Westeros, due to a storm that scattered its fleet.
*The Golden Company ships the elephants, but the great cogs that carry most of them have not arrived yet.
*It is not Asha ([[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]]'s name in the novels) who is held captive by [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]], but [[Aeron Greyjoy]].
*Asha and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] are currently held captive at [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s camp.
*Euron has no interest in Cersei (he wants to wed [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]), and Cersei has no intentions of forming an alliance with the [[ironborn]], whom she disdainfully considers as "a sorry pack of squids".
*[[Bronn]] has a [[Castle Stokeworth|castle]], and has not been hired by [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] to kill [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and/or [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] for one.
*The Lannisters (Tyrion and Cersei) have fulfilled all the promises they ever made to Bronn.
*There is no mention in the books that [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] disliked [[Jon Snow|Jon]] when they were children, only that they were never as close as he and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] were.
*[[Robett Glover]] has always been loyal to the [[House Stark|Starks]].
*The wights make no noises.

==="[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"===
*[[Tormund]] tells the story about the giant in a much earlier point in the books, while Jon travels with the [[Free Folk|wildlings]]' host.
*Tormund's story is different in the novels: caught in a storm, he found a sleeping giant, cut open her belly, crawled inside her, and that way she kept him warm enough. At spring, she woke up, mistook Tormund for her baby, and suckled him for three whole months before he could get away. He admits to Jon that he did not kill the female giant, or any giant in general.
*[[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] tells [[Catelyn Stark#In the books|Lady Stoneheart]] that Jaime not only saved her from being gang-raped by the Brave Companions and sent her to save Sansa, but also saved her from the bear pit. She insists that Jaime had no part in the [[Red Wedding]], but her words fall on deaf ears.
*Brienne does not claim that Jaime lost his hand because he defended her.
*There is no mention of several past three-eyed crows.
*There is no mention in the novels that Jaime participated in the [[Siege of Pyke]], or any other stage of the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
*The knighting ceremony is longer than the one Jaime performed. In the TV series, only three of the Seven gods are mentioned: the [[Warrior]], the [[Father]], and the [[Mother]]. In ''The Hedge Knight'', the [[Maiden]] is also named, charging the new knight to protect all women.
*According to [[Barristan Selmy]], [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] indeed loved to sing, but there is no mention in the novels that he ever gave money to poor children.
*Daenerys does not believe that Rhaegar raped [[Lyanna Stark]]. All stories told to her about Rhaegar are by [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] and Targaryen loyalists, who wouldn't attempt to defame him.

==="[[The Long Night]]"===
*[[Dragonglass]] does not hurt [[wight]]s; on the other hand, fire, even very small, destroys them very quickly.
*There is no [[Night King]] in the novels. The [[Night's King]], who is already deceased by the beginning of the first book, was a known consort to the [[White Walkers|Others]], but not a central leader.
*[[Beric Dondarrion]] dies at a much earlier point, in a different way: shortly after the Red Wedding, he gives his life in order to resurrect [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]].

==="[[The Last of the Starks]]"===
*[[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] has never been referred to as "Gendry Rivers" (or "Gendry Waters") in the books.
*There is no mention in the books that King [[Daeron II Targaryen]] had a crippled relative, or that he designed a wheelchair.
*Bronn is never offered [[Riverrun]] or [[Highgarden]].
*[[Scorpion]]s cannot take down a dragon as easily as in the show. When the [[Dornishmen|Dornish]] killed [[Meraxes]] with a scorpion, it was an ''extremely'' lucky shot through the eye. Dragon-scales act as a powerful natural armor.

==="[[The Bells]]"===
* The bells of [[King's Landing]] do not signify surrender.
* The population of King's Landing is 500,000, not 1,000,000.
* The Golden Company's banner has no device, but is simply a plain gold field.
* The Golden Company is not solely led by Harry Strickland, especially not in battle, as Strickland is no warrior. Instead, it is ''de facto'' led by one of its former lieutenants, Jon Connington.
* [[Sandor Clegane|The Hound]] yells "Look at me!" to Sansa, not Arya, and it happens at a much earlier point. It seems this line was reused due to Rory McCann's audition performance, in which he read dialogue from the books.
* [[Arys Oakheart]] and [[Preston Greenfield]] are already deceased by the point the novels have reached; the former was killed by [[Areo Hotah]], the latter - during the [[riots in King's Landing]] (note that these Kingsguards are only presumed to include Arys and Preston in the show).
* Ser Robert Strong, the reanimated [[Gregor Clegane|Mountain]], apparently has no skull.

==="[[The Iron Throne]]"===
*Jaime, not Brienne, is the one who records his defeat at the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]] in the [[Book of Brothers|White Book]].
*Jaime does not write in the White Book who freed him from the captivity in Riverrun, what was the promise he made and to whom, just "''ransomed for a promise unfulfilled''". On the other hand, he does specify his following captivity by the Brave Companions and his maiming at [[Locke#In the books|Vargo Hoat]]'s order.
*[[Arthur Dayne]]'s father is unknown.
*Jaime was knighted at the age of fifteen, not sixteen (however, Arthur Dayne's entry in the White Book does state that he was fifteen, directly contradicting Jaime's entry in the same scene).
