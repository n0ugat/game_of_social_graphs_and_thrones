{{Quote|The Tall Men at first scorned the Horselords as uncivilized barbarians. Which they were. But Khal Mengo had united all of them into one khalasar with one aim. To trample the world beneath their hooves and take other peoples as their herd. One by one, the cities of the Tall Men were overwelmed|[[Jorah Mormont]]|The Dothraki}}
''Khal'' '''Mengo''' was a [[Dothraki]] ''[[khal]]'' during the [[Century of Blood]].

==Biography==
During the Century of Blood, Mengo united the Dothraki into a single ''[[khalasar]]'' for the purpose of conquering the [[Known world|world]] and all its peoples. During his reign, his ''khalasar'' conquered many of the cities of [[Kingdom of Sarnor]] and largely wiped out the [[Sarnori]]. Mengo was succeeded by his son, [[Moro (son of Mengo)|Moro]].{{Ref|H&L608}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Mengo united all of the [[Dothraki]] tribes and ''[[khalasar]]s'' under the guidance of his mother Doshi and became the first great ''[[khal]]'', enslaving and killing any who refused to follow him. In his later years he moved against the [[Kingdom of Sarnor]]. The [[Sarnori]] looked down on the Dothraki and attempted to convince the horselords to fight for them by bribing them with gifts such as gold and slaves. Mengo took the gifts and then burned the fields, towns and farms that the Sarnori had built. The Dothraki consider it a sin to cut the flesh of the earth with plows, spades and axes, hence they wished to return the [[Dothraki Sea]] to its former state.
