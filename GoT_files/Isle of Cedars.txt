The '''Isle of Cedars'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is an island between [[Slaver's Bay]] and the [[Gulf of Grief]]. It is home to the cities [[Ghozai]] and [[Velos]]. The island appears on a map in [[Archmaester]] [[Ebrose]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.<ref>[https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/season-8-episode-6-series-finale-props-song-of-ice-and-fire/ Making ''Game of Thrones'', ASOIAF prop]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novel series, the Isle of Cedars has been abandoned since the [[Doom of Valyria]], when a tsunami 300 feet high washed over the island, killing all of its inhabitants numbering in the hundreds of thousands. It is still inhabited by animals, including pigs and monkeys. In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Victarion Greyjoy thinks that the "Isle of Monkeys" would be a better name for the island. He and his [[Iron Fleet]] make a stop near the ruin of Velos, and later hunt a trading galley named ''Ghiscari Dawn'' near Ghozai.
