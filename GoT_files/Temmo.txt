''Khal'' '''Temmo''' was a [[Dothraki]] ''[[khal]]'' during the [[Century of Blood]].

==Biography==
Temmo embarked on a vast campaign of plunder in the [[Century of Blood]] that followed the chaos of the [[Doom of Valyria]]. Without the Valyrians and their [[dragon]]s to keep them in check, the Dothraki swept across [[Essos]]. During this time Temmo commanded a ''[[khalasar]]'' numbering in the tens of thousands.{{Ref|H&L301}}

Temmo was finally stopped, however, by a force of 3,000 [[Unsullied]] warrior-[[eunuch]]s during the [[Battle of Qohor]]. The Dothraki could easily have outflanked the Unsullied, but by tradition they scorn infantry, and thinking of them as easily ridden down. On this occasion, however, the lockstep phalanxes of the Unsullied held firm, and fearlessly resisted his khalasar's assaults. By the end of the battle only 600 Unsullied remained, but 12,000 Dothraki had been killed, including Temmo and his sons. Defeated, the surviving Dothraki cut off their braids and threw them at the feet of the Unsullied, to mark their shame, and departed.{{Ref|H&L301}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Temmo's story is about the same; [[Jorah Mormont]] tells it to [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], in order to persuade her to purchase Unsullied troops, and she does.{{Bookref|ASOS|8}}

According to ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Temmo had multiple wives.
