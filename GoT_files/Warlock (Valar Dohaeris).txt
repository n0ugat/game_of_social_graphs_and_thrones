{{Quote|The Warlocks...|[[Daenerys Targaryen]] after surviving an assassination attempt|Valar Dohaeris}}
This '''Warlock''' is an assassin. Like her cohorts, she displays the blue-stained lips of those who drink [[shade of the evening]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
This Warlock appears as a young girl and entices [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] to play while in [[Astapor]]. The ball she rolls to Dany actually contains a [[manticore]]. Before the manticore can strike, Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] stabs it in the back with a dagger and kills the creature. The assassin runs and jumps off the dock - only to then magically appear in the distance. The warlock escapes uninjured.{{Ref|GOT301}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daenerys is the target of an assassination attempt (the second of three) before abandoning [[Qarth]], and is saved by Barristan Selmy, though he is under the assumed identity of "Arstan Whitebeard" at the time. In the books, this occurred on the docks of Qarth as she was leaving, but the TV series moved it forward slightly to occur in Astapor, soon after Daenerys arrives from Qarth.

In the books, the would-be assassin is not a Warlock but a Sorrowful Man, an ancient guild of assassins in Qarth known for whispering "I am so sorry" to their victims before killing them. It is not known who orders the attempt on Daenerys's life, as several Qartheen factions have called for her death by this time in the narrative, though the Warlocks have a special interest in Daenerys's death after her dragons kill their leaders, the Undying Ones, when she tries to leave from the [[House of the Undying]].
