The '''hollow hill'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a sprawling underground complex of caves and tunnels located somewhere in the [[Riverlands]]. It is adopted by the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], and used as their base of operations during the [[War of the Five Kings]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], and [[Sandor Clegane]] are taken to the hollow hill, following the latter's capture by the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]. There, the trio are introduced to the Brotherhood's commander: Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]], who sentences Clegane to [[trial by combat]].{{Ref|GOT304}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the hollow hill also serves as the headquarters of the Brotherhood Without Banners. For this reason, some members of the Brotherhood refer to themselves as "the knights of hollow hill."
