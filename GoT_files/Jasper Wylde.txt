{{Quote|My queen, there was no need to sully you with darkling schemes.|Jasper Wylde, to Alicent Hightower|The Green Council}}
Lord '''Jasper Wylde''', known as '''Ironrod''', is the head of [[House Wylde]]. Late in the reign of King [[Viserys I Targaryen]], he joined the [[Small Council]], occupying the post of [[Master of Laws]], a position he continues to hold under [[Aegon II Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Lord Jasper Wylde of the [[Rain House]] joined the [[Small Council]] to replace Lord [[Lyonel Strong]] in the post of master of laws.{{Guideref|Jasper Wylde}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
By [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|The Princess and the Queen}} Jasper has become the new [[Master of Laws]]{{Guideref|Jasper Wylde}} to fill the spot vacated by [[Lyonel Strong]] after his appointment to [[Hand of the King]]. During a session of the Small Council regarding the [[Stepstones]], he wonders aloud about the location of Prince [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]], sarcastically correcting himself by calling Daemon [[King of the Narrow Sea|King]] as "he won a [[Siege of Bloodstone|battle]] [[Bloodstone|there]] once." At the end of the meeting, Jasper stands up to leave the room, but Rhaenyra interjects and tells the council to wait in order to make a proposition to Queen [[Alicent Hightower]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

In [[132 AC]],{{Dateref|The Lord of the Tides}} during the time of Alicent's regency, Jasper is present at the Small Council meeting, briefly discussing the succession of [[Driftmark]]. In counter to [[Lyman Beesbury]]'s stance that [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] is the rightful heir, Jasper argues that [[Corlys Velaryon|Corlys]] never formally named Lucerys as his heir. Later he listens to Lyman Beesbury's "exhaustive" accounting of the realm's finances.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Lord Jasper is part of the [[Green Council]]. When Alicent demands to know why she was not informed of the plot to crown her son [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], Jasper replies that they did not want to sully her with "darkling schemes." Jasper also asserts that their plotting is now irrelevant since [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] ostensibly changed his mind on his heir, angering Lyman Beesbury. Jasper supports the plan to crown Aegon as [[king]] and assassinate Rhaenyra and her family to eliminate her rival claim. When he tries to persuade Alicent of the benefit of such an act, she angrily silences Jasper by threatening to strip him of his position and have him exiled to the [[Wall]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Jasper is later present in the [[Dragonpit]] during Aegon's coronation, standing on the stage with the rest of the Green Council.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Jasper is present during a session of the [[Green Council]]. When Dowager Queen [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] questions Grand Maester Orwyle whether [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] has responded to her letters, Jasper cynically asks if one was an apology for her dead [[Lucerys Velaryon|son]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

In the wake of the [[Assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen|murder]] of Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]], when King Aegon insists on blaming his half-sister Rhaenyra for his son's death, Jasper insists they need to be certain the prince's murder was Rhaenyra's handiwork and not that of some unknown enemy. The comment prompts Aegon to round on him, accusing Jasper and the other members of the Green Council of potentially being traitors until Otto Hightower defuses the situation.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

At the first meeting of the Green Council following the appointment of Ser [[Criston Cole]] to the post of [[Hand of the King]], when Cole and King Aegon discuss the appointment of his friends, Sers [[Martyn Reyne]], [[Leon Estermont]] and [[Eddard Waters]], to the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] following the resignation of Ser [[Harrold Westerling]], the defections of Sers [[Erryk Cargyll]], [[Lorent Marbrand]] and [[Steffon Darklyn]], and the death of Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]], Jasper mutters that Arryk's death during his botched assassination attempt on Rhaenyra was a needless loss. The Council discusses the aftermath of the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]]; Jasper insists Houses [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken|Bracken]] are using the succession crisis to continue their age old feud, only for Aegon to angrily insist that both his faction and the Blacks will consider it an act of war. When [[Grand Maester]] [[Orwyle]] proposes sending a [[raven]] to Lord [[Grover Tully]] at [[Riverrun]] to rein in his bannermen, Jasper insultingly derides Grover as an old man with little to no control over his bannermen. King Aegon asks Jasper to provide an alternative; Jasper suggests sending word to Lord [[Ormund Hightower]] to bring his army, along with Aegon's younger brother, Prince [[Daeron Targaryen|Daeron]] and [[Tessarion|his dragon]], against the Blackwoods, only for Ser [[Tyland Lannister]] to dismiss the proposal, insisting it will take months for Ormund to muster his host, whereas Tyland's brother, Lord [[Jason Lannister]] is assembling the armies of the [[Westerlands]] at [[Casterly Rock]], a force which will be ready to march in a matter of weeks.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Following [[Larys Strong]]'s inclusion to the Green Council, Jasper and the other council members discuss the expenses of the war and [[Daemon Targaryen]] claiming [[Harrenhal]]. Aegon, however, is bored, and Jasper stands up when his king decides to leave the meeting.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

==Behind the scenes==
Jasper Wylde's character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"The master of laws on King Aegon II’s small council."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros.

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Jasper Wylde was called Ironrod by the [[smallfolk]] due to his unbending attitudes to law, according to Septon Eustace. According to the court fool Mushroom, it referred to the stiffness of his member, as he had fathered 29 children with four wives before the last died of exhaustion.
