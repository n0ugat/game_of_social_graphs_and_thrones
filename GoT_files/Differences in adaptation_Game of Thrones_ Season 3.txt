{{DISPLAYTITLE:Differences in adaptation/''Game of Thrones'': Season 3}}
The following is a list of '''differences''' between [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]] and the first half of ''[[A Storm of Swords]]'', the book from which it is adapted.

==Differences by episode==
==="[[Valar Dohaeris]]"===
*Nearly the whole scene of the [[fight at the Fist]] is omitted in the TV series.
*[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] is on the [[Fist of the First Men]] during the [[White Walkers|White Walker]]/[[wight]] attack. He did send out ravens, but only two of them carried a message. Those who remained in Castle Black received Sam's message.
*Sam collapses during the retreat. Only Grenn and Small Paul remain with him. Soon, the three fall behind the rest of the survivors, and a white walker attacks them. Sam kills it, earning himself the nickname "Sam the Slayer".
*[[Ghost]] is not present during the battle, as he is with [[Jon Snow]].
*Most of the remaining brothers of the [[Night's Watch]] were all on horseback after their escape.
*In the books, [[Rast]] was never present at the [[Fist of the First Men]] as he remained a recruit and stayed at [[Castle Black]].
*The [[Free Folk|wildling]] spears are all tipped with metal points, while in the novels, they are are simple, fire-hardened, sharpened poles.
**In the behind-the-scenes featurettes, the production team explains that most of the wildlings actually do carry weapons made of only sharpened wood or bone because they don't have enough knowledge of metallurgy to make their own. However, in the books, it is mentioned that wildlings will scavenge steel weapons from the bodies of members of the Night's Watch they have killed. Thus, in the TV series, some of the wildlings do have steel weapons, but they're the same design as those used by the Night's Watch to indicate that they were only scavenged.
*In the novels, [[giants]] wear no clothing, they are covered in shaggy fur pelts like mammoths. They are much more like descriptions of a Sasquatch or yeti.
*In the novels, when Jon Snow enters [[Mance Rayder]]'s tent, Mance is singing a song, which makes Jon think of him as a singer and not the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]. There are five more people in the tent: Mance's wife Dalla, her sister Val, a wildling raider named Jarl, [[Styr]], and [[Tormund]]. Since Styr and Tormund look like leaders, Jon thinks incorrectly that one of them is Mance.
*Jon does not kneel before Tormund in the books.
*Mance is glad [[Qhorin]] is dead, but also sad since Qhorin was once his friend.
*Mance Rayder recognizes Jon since Mance had seen him twice at Winterfell. The first time Mance saw Jon was when Mance visited [[Winterfell]] as a member of the Night's Watch and saw Jon and Robb playing together as young boys at the castle. The second time Mance had seen Jon is when Mance came to Winterfell as a singer during [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s visit and took note of Ned Stark's six children with their direwolves.
*Jon gives a different reason as to why he wants to join the [[Free Folk]], involving his bastardy.
*There is no mention in the books that [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] had a servant girl beaten at Casterly Rock who lost an eye as a result, for stealing a necklace, and that Tyrion told Tywin about that.
*[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] visited [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] many times while he was unconscious.
*[[Podrick Payne|Pod]] mentions that [[Bronn]] was anointed by the King himself. In the book, Bronn is anointed by a member of the [[Kingsguard]].
*The scene with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Shae]] does not happen in the book.
*[[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] never approached Sansa directly with his offer of escape, but acted through an intermediary - [[Dontos Hollard]]. Sansa had no idea that Dontos works for Littlefinger.
*Baelish never tells Sansa that [[Arya Stark|Arya]] is alive, as he never visits [[Harrenhal]] to observe her as Tywin's cup bearer.
**While Littlefinger does stare at Tywin's cup bearer briefly, Arya is careful not to look at him and it is unclear if he recognized her. Littlefinger wouldn't have known that Arya escaped Harrenhal, and moreover, Harrenhal falls to the Starks in this episode. Moreover, it is implausible that Littlefinger would discover Arya at Harrenhal but do nothing to keep her under his control. Compare his earlier lie to Catelyn about having both Sansa and Arya in [[King's Landing]].
*The scene between Tyrion and Cersei in Tyrion's chambers does not happen in the book.
*The scene where [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] comforts the orphans and hands out food does not happen in the book, though Cersei receives reports that Margaery and her family are deftly building up support for themselves among the commoners by handing out food aid, buying hot pies off baker's carts, giving alms to beggars, and so on and so forth. Ironically, the Tyrells actually heavily contributed to the famine of the smallfolk by closing the Rose's Road.
*During Margaery's tours at the city, she is accompanied by Tommen, not Joffrey. Cersei chides Tommen, not Margaery, for putting himself in danger, reminding him of the [[Riots in King's Landing|riots]].
*The dinner scene with the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] and [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] does not happen in the book.
*[[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] was stranded on a tall spire of rock, not a conical island.
*It is not made clear how long Davos was stranded in the TV series, while in the book he is there for about a fortnight.
*While Davos is on the island, he prays to the Mother to have mercy; soon he hears a voice (or imagines that, since he is feverish, undernourished and overwhelmed with grief over the loss of four of his sons), which he believes to be the Mother; the voice chides him for doing nothing to stop the destruction of the idols of the [[Seven]] in Dragonstone and the [[Godswood]] in Storm's End, and blames him for [[Cressen]]'s death and for participating the murder of Ser Cortnay Penrose. The whole scene is omitted from the series.
*Davos was rescued by Khorane Sathmantes, one of [[Salladhor Saan]]'s captains, not Saan himself.
*Davos was not taken to see [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] for months as he was thrown in the dungeon almost the moment he set foot on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. [[Melisandre]] has foreseen Davos's plan to kill her.
*In the books, it was not Davos but Lord Bryce Caron, Lord of Nightsong and one of Stannis's most powerful bannerman, who persuaded Stannis not to bring Melisandre to the Blackwater. Lord Caron was killed during the Battle of the Blackwater. He does not appear in the series.
*There was never a massacre at Harrenhal.
*Neither Catelyn nor Robb Stark went to Harrenhal. They never met [[Qyburn]], nor any other member of the Brave Companions.
*Qyburn was therefore never encountered at Harrenhal having survived a massacre, nor was he affiliated with Robb's army.
*By this time in the books, Harrenhal was already taken by [[Roose Bolton]].
*Arya was still at Harrenhal when the Northern army arrived, and she served as Roose Bolton's [[cupbearer]].
*The conversation between [[Rickard Karstark]] and Roose Bolton never happened in the books.
*[[Daenerys Targaryen]] is seen traveling with only one ship in TV series. In the books, she travels with three ships named "Vhagar", "Meraxes" and "Balerion", named after the [[dragon]]s of her ancestors, [[Aegon I Targaryen]] and his sisters, [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] 
*The ships were sent by [[Illyrio Mopatis]] in the books. In the TV series, she bought one ship after she had looted [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos|Xaro]]'s mansion in Qarth.
*Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] does not reveal his identity until much later in the book, after he kills [[Mero]]. He adopts the alias Arstan Whitebeard, a man in the service of Illyrio. Having, by his own admission, spent decades serving a drunk and a madman, Barristan wanted to assess Daenerys's character before committing himself to her. He also grows his hair and beard long, which is such an effective disguise that not even Jorah Mormont recognizes him. This change was probably because book readers did not know "Arstan"'s real identity until he was outed, whereas TV viewers would have recognized Barristan instantly.
*In the books, Ser Barristan is squire for Strong Belwas, a character that does not exist in the series.
*[[Astapor]] is constructed of crumbling red bricks in the novels.
*Daenerys first plans to go to [[Pentos]], but takes a detour to Astapor on Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]'s insistence.
*[[Missandei]] is also much younger than she is presented in the TV series. She is around 10 at this time.
*The [[Unsullied]] training also includes the recruits raising a puppy for a year before strangling it to death. Also unmentioned is that during their training the Unsullied are given a potion to drink known as the Wine of Courage, which gradually deadens their bodies' sensitivity to pain. In the books, it is stated that only one in three boys survive the years of training to become Unsullied, while the TV series says that only one in four boys survives.
*The assassination attempt on [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is made back in [[Qarth]], before she leaves for Astapor. It is also sent by the [[warlocks]], but it is through a Qartheen guild of assassins known as the Sorrowful Men.
*There is no mention in the books that Salladhor has any children.

==="[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]"===
*[[Jojen Reed|Jojen]] and [[Meera Reed]] are introduced much earlier, in the book ''A Clash of Kings''; they come as guests during one of the harvest feasts at [[Winterfell]].
*Jojen Reed is much younger in the books.
*[[Osha]] never threatened Jojen with any weapon, and Meera never threatened Osha with any weapon.
*[[Bran Stark|Bran]] dreams of a [[Brynden Rivers#In the books|three-eyed crow]], not a raven.
*[[Osha]], [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] and [[Shaggydog]] had split up from Bran, [[Hodor]], [[Summer]] and the Reeds long before, in the end of the book ''A Clash of Kings'', at Maester [[Luwin]]'s advice. The TV producers said they pushed the Reeds back into Season 3 because there wasn't enough time to fit them into Season 2 without overfilling the season with too many characters.
*In the books, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] was at [[Riverrun]] at her [[Hoster Tully|father]]'s bedside long before he died since the first book ''A Game of Thrones'', until his death in ''A Storm of Swords''.
*In the books, [[Rickard Karstark]] never expresses any thoughts about the breaching of the marriage pact with the Freys or about losing the war.
*After receiving a report from Ser Rodrik about the alleged death of Bran and Rickon, neither Robb nor Catelyn had any hope that maybe they are still alive. They are also resigned to the fact that Arya is probably dead too. The TV writers said that to have Catelyn react in shock to another death in her family, after having the same reaction when Eddard was killed, would be too similar. Instead they felt it would be more interesting for her to understandably struggle with some false hope for a while, but by the next episode she is coming to grips with the reality that they are probably dead.
*Robb and Catelyn are reported on two occasions about the sack of Winterfell, first by Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers, and later Roose tells more details about it.
*In the book, similarly to the show, Roose falsely claims that the ironborn destroyed Winterfell and killed its occupants; he also lies about the fate of Ser Rodrik, Cley Cerwyn and Leobald Tallhart, claiming they were killed by the ironborn. He does not, however, falsely claim that Theon and the other ironborn escaped before Ramsay arrived there; instead, he tells Robb and Catelyn that Theon was taken captive to the Dreadfort, and is being flayed by Ramsay (that part is true).
*Catelyn's tale to Talisa about attempting to love [[Jon Snow]] as her own son after he nearly died from a pox is not in the books.
*The scene where [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] insults [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] does not happen in the books.
*[[Shae]] becomes [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]'s maid much later, and they are never on such amicable terms.
*[[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] is considerably upset when he meets Sansa in the books, as she reminds him of more innocent times at the [[Tournament#Tourney of the Hand|Tourney of the Hand]]. In the books, Loras recklessly killed [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]'s two [[Kingsguard]] members, [[Robar Royce]] and [[Emmon Cuy]], who were outside his tent when he was assassinated, out of sheer rage. Sansa mentions that she saw him defeat Robar Royce in the joust. Loras explains that he has killed Royce as well as Cuy, and becomes quite distraught because he is remorseful for his past actions.
*At the dinner Sansa is invited to, in addition to [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna]] and [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] she meets Margaery's mother [[Alerie Tyrell]], her distant cousins Megga, Alla and Elinor, and more of the Tyrells' retinue: Janna Fossoway, Leonette Tyrell, Septa Nysterica, Alyce Graceford, Alysanne Bulwer, Meredyth Crane, Taena Merryweather and the jester Butterbumps.
*Sansa's description of Joffrey to Olenna Tyrell is actually much longer in the books. As in the series, it becomes increasingly clear that Sansa is worried that they will be overheard by the ever-present spies around the [[Red Keep]]. Therefore, Olenna bids her jester Butterbumps to sing "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]" until he is bellowing it out at the top of his lungs. While the exact conversation is not presented in the text, Sansa describes in explicit detail all of the atrocities that Joffrey has committed since becoming king and long before that - lying about [[Mycah]], causing her father to kill [[Lady]], ludicrously ordering a dozen guards to kill a crowd of starving peasants numbering in the hundreds, shooting refugees with a crossbow simply for begging for bread at the castle gates, having her stripped and beaten in front of the entire court, etc. This did not seem to concern Olenna and Margaery, who apparently have already known what monster Joffrey is, and what Sansa told them only confirmed that.
*[[Shae]] does not come to visit Tyrion until much later in the books, and even then they meet in the cellars at the dragon skulls.
*Shae never expressed any concern about Sansa.
*The crossbow scene with Joffrey and Margaery doesn't happen in the books.
*Renly's homosexuality was only implied in the books, though George R.R. Martin has independently confirmed that he intended Renly and Loras to be lovers. Cersei's private disgust with Renly as a "degenerate" does not correspond to a scene from the novels at this point, though she does make similar comments to this effect disparaging Loras's homosexuality at other points in the book.
*In the books, the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] only speak the [[Old Tongue]], though a few speak [[Common Tongue|the Common Tongue]] (archaic English), not 7 different languages.
*The character [[Orell]] was killed in ''A Clash of Kings''. He and [[Ygritte]] were two of the three watchers that Qhorin's party encountered. Orell and the third wildling were slain, but part of Orell's spirit remained in his eagle. Technically, Orell should not appear in the third season; he lives on by warging in his eagle. The TV character "Orell" is more of a splice with another [[Warg]] character, Varamyr Sixskins.
*A character called Small Paul, steward of the [[Night's Watch]], carries Sam on his back in the book; [[Rast]] is not even on the beyond the [[Wall]] expedition.
*[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]], [[Grenn]], and Paul fall behind the survivors of the Watch, and encounter one of the [[White Walkers|Others]] (who had been hunting down the Night's Watch survivors since their retreat from the [[Fight at the Fist|fight]], picking off any unlucky enough to fall behind). Paul is slain but Sam manages to kill the thing by stabbing it with a dragonglass dagger (unaware it is lethal to the Others), discovering their vulnerability to dragonglass (obsidian) in the process. Part of the scene is portrayed in a later episode, "[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]".
*The Night's Watch was retreating through the [[Haunted Forest]] in the novel.
*[[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Hot Pie]] and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] were all horseback and were headed for [[Riverrun]] using a map Arya stole.
*Arya and her companions came across the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|outlaws]] on a road near a river, not the forest.
*The singer Arya hears wasn't [[Thoros]], but a man named Tom of Sevenstreams, who was singing about a maid of Gulltown, not "[[The Rains of Castamere]]." 
*Arya scarcely recognized Thoros from his days at [[King's Landing]] in the books.
*Thoros wasn't with the outlaws who found Arya. He is described as wearing faded red, almost pink, robes. Being from Myr, he also has a foreign accent.
*The events surrounding [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]'s imprisonment are not mentioned in the novels until the fifth book ''A Dance with Dragons''. The readers were left wondering if Theon had survived the [[Sack of Winterfell]], though it is mentioned by [[Roose Bolton]] that he is being flayed at the [[Dreadfort]].
*[[Sandor Clegane]] does not appear until much later in the book. He does not reveal Arya's true identity to the Brotherhood. In fact, he does not even recognize her at first, even when she openly accuses him of Mycah's death, only after taking a good look at her. Several members of the Brotherhood are actually the last remnants of her father Eddard's personal guard that he sent out to bring [[Gregor Clegane]] to justice, and one of them, Harwin, recognizes Arya instantly. Harwin was actually present when the newborn [[direwolf]] pups were found in the first regular chapter of the series (after the first Prologue scene).
*The people that find [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] are the notorious [[Mercenary|sellsword]] company Brave Companions (who do not exist in the series), not Bolton's men. There was no farmer who told them where to find Jaime and Brienne. The noise Jaime and Brienne made while fighting attracted the attention of the Brave Companions. They also fought for a long time before being found, and ended in a river where Jaime slipped and fell. Also, from her POV Brienne notes that Jaime was difficult to fight, even while malnourished and shackled.
*Cleos Frey (who was replaced by [[Alton Lannister]] in the series) travels with Jaime and Brienne in the book. Shortly before the encounter with the Brave Companions, they were attacked by archer outlaws who killed Cleos and injured Brienne. It's Cleos's sword that Jaime took when he dueled Brienne. Brienne was injured by two arrows before she fought Jaime. Both managed to injure each other, but Brienne overcame Jaime.

==="[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]"===
*[[Brynden Tully]] isn't upset with his [[Edmure Tully|nephew]] for missing his father [[Hoster Tully]]'s funeral boat with his flaming arrow. The book makes it explicit that Edmure misses because he is so consumed by grief at his father's death that he cannot shoot straight. Brynden later tells [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] that Hoster himself was so consumed by grief at their father's funeral that he also kept missing the funeral boat.
*While at Riverrun for the funeral, Robb informs his mother that Sansa has been married to Tyrion. Their reaction to the news, if they found out, is never shown in the TV series.
*Brynden Tully calls himself "the Blackfish" because of his rocky relationship with his older brother, stemming from Brynden's refusal to take part in a marriage-alliance to [[House Redwyne]] which Hoster proposed for him. This led to Hoster calling him the black sheep of the Tully family, but pointing out that the Tully symbol is a fish, Brynden decided that this made him the "Blackfish" of the Tully family. Brynden took as his personal sigil the normal blue and red [[House Tully|Tully]] heraldry, but with the silver fish replaced with a black one.
*Edmure is enraged that [[Walder Frey]] sent "a cripple and a bastard" ([[Lothar Frey]] and [[Walder Rivers]] respectively) to the funeral, but [[Robb Stark|Robb]] greets them with courtesy and gives Lothar Frey a spot as pallbearer.
*Edmure's blunder is actually dealing [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] a loss at the Battle of the Fords. Robb wanted Edmure's army to make only a token defense and then retreat, allowing Tywin to cross the [[Red Fork]] with his army. Robb could then have hemmed Tywin within his own lands, and Tywin would have been unable to come to the defense of King's Landing when [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] [[Battle of the Blackwater|attacked]]. The Northerners could then have negotiated with Stannis once he had taken the capital. The defeat by Edmure meant that when news of Stannis's impending attack reached Tywin, he was able to hurriedly march to King's Landing and help defeat Stannis.
*[[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister]] are not Tywin's father's brother's great-grandsons, but his nephews. They were not captured by [[Edmure Tully]] in the [[Battle of the Fords]], but by the Starks long before: Willem and his cousin Tion Frey (son of [[Genna Lannister]] and Emmon Frey) were captured in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]], while Martyn was captured in the [[Battle of Oxcross]]. Robb may have been trying to make a point for emphasis's sake when he said that if Tywin didn't stop when his own eldest son was prisoner, he won't stop when his more distant relatives are prisoners either. In "[[Kissed by Fire]]", Edmure says they are Tywin's nephews.
*[[Podrick Payne|Podrick]] does not get a reward for saving [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]'s life in the book. Particularly, he is not rewarded with prostitutes: Podrick is much younger in the books, only about 12 or 13 years old, but was aged-up for the TV series.
*There is no mentioning in the book that the corpses at the Fist have been arranged in any pattern.
*[[Tormund]] and [[Orell]] are not among the wildlings that [[Mance Rayder]] sends to scale the [[Wall]].
**Also in the books, Mance sent 120 men to scale the Wall, led by [[Styr]], the Magnar of the [[Thenns]]. Four teams attempt the freeclimb and then raise a rope ladder. [[Jon Snow|Jon]] and [[Ygritte]] are amongst those who use the ladder. In the TV series, only 20 men scale the wall without any ladder.
*The specific scenes with Tyrion, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], [[Ros]], [[Bronn]], and Pod at the brothel do not happen in the books, though after Tyrion is made [[Master of Coin]] he comments on discrepancies in how Littlefinger has been running things. It is not mentioned that Littlefinger has increased the crown's incomes tenfold since coming into office. Tyrion also does not mention the Iron Bank, but speaks generally about the crown's heavy debts.
*It is not Bronn who suggests that Tywin forgives the crown's debt to House Lannister. Tyrion asks that his father directly. Tywin responds "Don't be absurd".
*The literal "game of thrones" that [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] plays with the [[Small Council]] does not occur in the books. However, it is an accurate assessment of the disposition of these characters: Baelish is zealously ambitious, [[Varys]] is content to let Littlefinger think he has the upper hand, and [[Pycelle]] has survived numerous regime changes in King's Landing by not actively competing with the other advisors. [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] is determined to be at her father's right hand even when he doesn't provide her with a position to be so. Tyrion, meanwhile, actively disdains trying to win his father's favor at all, and mocks the others by going out of his way not to.
*After Pycelle was released from prison, he resembles a shambling skeleton, leaning heavily on a twisted cane and shaking as he walks, a few white hairs sprouting from his long neck in place of his once-luxuriant white beard. In the series, the only visible change about him is that his beard is shorter than before being imprisoned, most likely because Bronn cut a part of it off under the order of Tyrion.
*Tywin's Small Council has more members in the books. [[Mace Tyrell]], his bannermen Mathis Rowan and [[Paxter Redwyne]], [[Kevan Lannister]], and the [[High Septon]] are all present at the first council meeting.
*[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] do not stop at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], but a different inn further southwest known as the Inn of the Kneeling Man. The irony is that last episode, Arya made a big point stressing that the Red Fork of the [[Trident]] River is a hundred feet wide and difficult to cross... yet in order to reach the Inn at the Crossroads from [[Harrenhal]], they would have to have crossed the Trident "off-screen" during the middle of the previous episode (as they are already having a meal at the inn by the end of the episode). In the books, the Inn of the Kneeling Man is south of the Red Fork, between Harrenhal and Riverrun.
**[[Hot Pie]], therefore, stays at the Inn of the Kneeling Man in the books, not at the Inn at the Crossroads. 
**The innkeeper of the Inn at the Crossroads, [[Masha Heddle]], was killed at the end of the first novel, when the Lannister armies overrun the Riverlands. Tywin has her hanged from a gibbet for allowing Catelyn to kidnap his son. Tyrion is quite pleased at this, although Masha was just an innocent bystander and didn't have any choice whether Catelyn took him prisoner or not. The inn is subsequently run by Masha's nephew. Masha's death hasn't been explicitly established in the TV series. In this TV episode, Hot Pie says that "the innkeeper" was impressed by his baking skills, but this doesn't necessarily mean that Masha is still alive in the TV continuity, as Hot Pie doesn't state what the specific name of "the innkeeper" is.
*[[Melisandre]] leaving [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] to search for "a king's blood" is a heavy condensation of Stannis Baratheon's storyline in the third novel. In the books, his brother King Robert does have one acknowledged [[bastard]] son, Edric Storm, who was raised at [[Storm's End]]. In the second novel, after [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] is assassinated outside of Storm's End by a shadow-creature, Cortnay Penrose the castellan holds out against Stannis and refuses to hand over Edric, so Melisandre has to make another shadow-creature to assassinate him as well. Subsequently, Stannis takes control of Storm's End, and takes Edric Storm back to Dragonstone for safe keeping. After Stannis' crippling defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, Melisandre urges that she must make a blood sacrifice by burning Edric alive as an offering to the [[Lord of Light]]. Much of the Dragonstone subplot in the third novel revolves around whether or not Stannis will go through with sacrificing Edric Storm.
*Melisandre explains Davos, not Stannis, why she cannot make more shadows.
*Stannis does not ask Melisandre to make more shadows.
*Melisandre does not travel to the Riverlands or any other place.
*[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] doesn't see the birth of [[Gilly]]'s baby in the book.
*The events surrounding [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]'s escape are not mentioned in the novels until the fifth book, ''A Dance with Dragons''.
*In the show, Jaime advises Brienne that when the soldiers rape her - she'd better close her eyes and pretend they are Renly; in the book, he says that teasingly.
*[[Locke]] (Vargo Hoat's show counterpart) never participated in [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]'s attempted rape as [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] had already informed him about [[Tarth]]'s sapphires, and forbade his men to harm her.
*Vargo Hoat does not personally maim Jaime in the book. Vargo gives the order, but one of his subordinates in the Brave Companions, a fat [[Dothraki]] named Zollo, carries out the deed. It is done not because Jaime irritates him with his arrogance and continual attempts to bribe him, as in the TV series, but in order to drive a wedge between Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton, as Roose explains Jaime later.
*When [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] walks through the streets of [[Astapor]] and comes to the [[Walk of Punishment|Plaza of Punishment]], she sees a wooden platform where rebellious slaves are racked, flayed and hanged, but she does not try to help any of them.
*The [[Good Masters]] of Astapor stick to the rule that the Unsullied are only sold by the unit of 1,000 or 100. Their offer to sell 100+20+3 Unsullied in the TV series is against this rule. In fact, in the books, they offer to sell 1,000 Unsullied in exchange for Daenerys's ship and goods, and another 100 for her crown (never appears in the TV series).
*After Daenerys offers [[Kraznys mo Nakloz|Kraznys]] a dragon in return for the [[Unsullied]], only [[Barristan Selmy|Ser Barristan]] publicly pleads with her not to take the deal. Barristan is still under the guise of "Arstan Whitebeard", a masquerade he puts up to get to know Daenerys. He is also accompanied by the omitted character, Strong Belwas. Kraznys gives Daenerys [[Missandei]] as a token of their deal, rather than Daenerys asking for her.

==="[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"===
*[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] shaves his head in the book to avoid being recognized before being caught by Vargo Hoat (the rough counterpart of [[Locke]] in the books) and his men.
*After having his hand cut off, Jaime rides on the same horse as [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], at first tied back-to-back, then face-to-face as part of the abusing he suffered from his captors.
*Jaime doesn't spit out the horse urine, as he is desperate to drink anything at the point it is offered. However, he later throws up from consuming it and soils himself while riding, so Brienne is forced to clean him up.
*On the way to [[Harrenhal]], three of the Brave Companions ([[Rorge]], Shagwell, and Zollo) sneak at night to where Brienne sleeps, intending to rape her although Vargo Hoat forbade them because he believed Jaime's lie about sapphires. Again, Jaime intervenes in time to save Brienne from gang-rape: he yells "sapphires" loudly enough for Hoat to hear him. The three thugs beat Jaime severely till loses consciousness, but his shout does the trick: Hoat comes and stops his men. Since then, Hoat puts guards to make sure no one harms Brienne. Brienne thanks Jaime for his help.
*[[Varys]] tells [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] the tale of how he was castrated before the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], while they were discussing the strange circumstances of Cortnay Penrose's death. In both versions, Varys explains that he traveled around in several of the [[Free Cities]] before being castrated in [[Myr]], but in the books, he also adds the detail that he was born in [[Lys]].
*Varys never captures the [[sorcerer]] who cut him in the books.
*Varys's scene with [[Ros]] does not exist in the books; Ros is an invented character for the TV series, but even in the books no character spies on [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] for Varys this way. In the books, no one else is aware of Littlefinger's plot to sneak [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] out of the city.
*The scene with the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]] and the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] in the [[Great Sept of Baelor|Great Sept]] doesn't happen in the books.
*It is not [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] but Stannis who mentions [[Aerion Targaryen]]. In fact, Aerion was the older brother of [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]].
**It's somewhat ironic that Joffrey mocks Aerion, given that Aerion's personality was actually quite similar to Joffrey's: mentally unbalanced, pointlessly sadistic, cruel to animals, and terrorizing his younger siblings. But in contrast to Joffrey, Aerion was a capable fighter in tourneys, a member of the [[Second Sons]] for a while and fought in the Third Blackfyre Rebellion.
*Joffrey wants to show [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] the tombs of the last Targaryens (presumably the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], his son [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], and Rhaegar's children [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|Rhaenys]]), and that [[Robert Baratheon]] wanted them burned and scattered in the Blackwater River, but the [[High Septon (Joffrey)|High Septon]] convinced him to give them a proper funeral. In the books, the Targaryens were very proud of their descent from the Old [[Valyrian Freehold]], and maintained the Valyrian custom of cremating their dead. Thus there are no tombs containing the corpses of past generations of the Targaryen dynasty. Even Rhaegar was cremated after he died at the [[Battle of the Trident]]. Rhaegar was a man who Robert Baratheon utterly hated and even fantasized about killing again even years after he died, but even Robert still gave Rhaegar a proper funeral (when Rhaegar's soldiers who surrendered at the Trident insisted on it), cremating his body according to the customs of Rhaegar's family. Robert never had to be talked out of throwing their remains into the Blackwater river by the High Septon.
**That being said, the books never specify what exactly the Targaryens did with the resulting ashes: they might have scattered them, but it is entirely possible that they interred urns containing the ashes (i.e. in a [[Wikipedia:Columbarium|columbarium]] within the Great Sept of Baelor). Joffrey does state in the episode that Aerion Brightflame's ashes are kept in an urn, but of course, Aerion was burned from the inside out when he consumed [[wildfire]]. Joffrey's line still seems to imply that burning the last Targaryens would have been an insult; but his line might plausibly be interpreted as that scattering the ashes (instead of interring them) is what would have been offensive.
*The books don't give explicitly detailed descriptions of what the [[Seven]] look like, other than basic details such as that the Father carries a set of scales, the Crone carries a lantern, etc. Being a visual medium, the TV series of course has to make fully realized artwork depicting the Seven. This episode shows the interior of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] for the first time, and the statues of the Seven in the main sanctum are depicted as Greco-Roman or Renaissance artistic nudes, i.e. the Father looks like a Classical statue of Zeus, with a flowing robe that does not conceal his nudity. The [[Faith of the Seven]] is meant to be a loose analogue of the medieval Catholic Church, which was quite conservative and frowned upon such artistic depictions of nudity (albeit Jesus was frequently depicted as naked or nearly so on the cross, etc.) Then again, the Art History of the Seven Kingdoms doesn't need to necessarily correspond to social currents in real life, and such artistic depictions of nudity and religious figures were common in the Renaissance, i.e. the Sistine Chapel.
*The scene where [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] discusses Jaime and the Tyrells with [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] never happens in the books, as neither are POV characters at this stage.
*Varys does not discuss [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] with [[Olenna Tyrell]] in the books. In fact, Varys takes no particular interest in Sansa in the novels and the plot to have her marry a Tyrell is Olenna's alone. In the book during her first meeting with Sansa, Olenna mentions that she was approached by Varys beforehand but doesn't think very highly of him, going as far to jape that [[eunuch]]s in general are just men with the useful bits cut off.
*The scene where Margaery and Sansa walk along the coast never happens in the books.
*There is no character named Allana in the books, either of House Tyrell or otherwise.
*The Tyrells planned to marry Sansa to [[Willas Tyrell]], who is Lord [[Mace Tyrell]]'s eldest son and heir, not to [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]], who by this point in the books has become a [[Kingsguard]] and cannot marry.
**In the TV show the producers had decided to cut out the other Tyrell-brothers Willas and Garlan Tyrell. Willas is also a character that never appeared in persona so far and was just mentioned in dialogues. To propose a marriage between a known character (Sansa) to an unseen could be too confusing on TV. The aspects of Garlan and Willas were merged into Loras, therefore the Tyrells wanted to marry him to Sansa.
*[[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] never openly stated that he considered [[Eddard Stark]] to be his real father in the books. In ''A Game of Thrones'' he announced that "''Lord Eddard is a second father to me"'', but did not mean that: to Theon, Eddard has always been the man who'd brought blood and fire to Pyke and taken him from his home. In ''A Dance with Dragons'', however, when [[Barbrey Dustin]] asks Theon why he loves the Starks, he admits that he "wanted to be one of them".
*Theon never admits to anyone that the boys he killed and tarred were not [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]].
*While the rangers of the Watch stay at [[Craster's Keep]], [[Grenn]] tells everyone how Sam destroyed the Other. Most of the rangers (those who later [[Mutineers|rebelled against Mormont]]) do not believe the story and taunt Sam, but Mormont and Sam's friends believe. Since then, Sam earned the nickname "the Slayer", which the other rangers use either as respect or for mockery. Sam hates that nickname, not because it is mostly used to tease him, but because he does not feel he deserves any credit for destroying the Other, claiming that it was not him but the [[dragonglass]] that killed the Other and that he is the same coward he has always been. He keeps asking people not to call him that, but for no avail.
*It is not Rast but Dirk who says that [[Bannen]] died because [[Craster]] starved him dead, and that the day they leave - Craster will feast and laugh at them, out starving in the snow. He says that before Bannen's funeral.
*It is not Rast but Dirk who tells Craster "So you admit you got a secret larder. How else to make it through a winter?"
*Craster has his throat slit by Dirk in the novels, while in the TV series, a dagger is thrust into his throat by [[Karl Tanner]], up into the roof of his mouth.
*Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] is stabbed in the gut in the books, not by Rast (who was not there but remained back at Castle Black) but by Ollo Lophand. Mormont does not manage to fight his murderer.
*[[Grenn]] and the rest of those who remain loyal to Mormont do not engage in fight against the [[Mutineers]], since the latter outnumber them by 2:1. Instead, they escape to Castle Black.
*Before dying, Mormont tells [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] to go to the [[Wall]], and to tell them "All. [[Fist of the First Men|Fist]]. The [[Free Folk|wildlings]]. [[Dragonglass]]. This. All. Tell my son. [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]]. Tell him, take the black. My wish. Dying wish. Tell Jorah. Forgive him. My son. Please. Go".
*Sam stays back in the books, holding Mormont as he lays dying. Mormont commands him to escape with the others but he doesn't. Then two of Craster's old wives urge him to take [[Gilly]] and the babe and leave. 
*Sam and Gilly escape horseback in the books (the Night's Watch still had some of its own horses when it arrived at Craster's Keep).
*The [[Unsullied]] respond to [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]'s offer of freedom by shouting "Dracarys!" in the novels.
*Daenerys swings the slaver's whip in [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]]'s face and then releases [[Drogon]] on him with the command "Dracarys".
*Daenerys offers her ships along with Drogon to buy Unsullied.
*[[Missandei]] is already aware that Daenerys can speak [[Low Valyrian]].
*Daenerys orders the Unsullied to harm no child under twelve. In the TV series, she wasn't so specific, and said, "harm no child".
*Daenerys's followers are aware of her plans beforehand and attack the slavers as soon as signaled (when she shouts "Dracarys" and the dragons begin to attack).
*It is not [[Anguy]], but the Mad Huntsman (another member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|Brotherhood]]) who relates to the atrocities performed by the Lannisters at the [[Mummer's Ford]].

==="[[Kissed by Fire]]"===
*It is [[Styr]], the Magnar of [[Thenns|Thenn]], who questions [[Jon Snow|Jon]] about the number of Sworn Brothers who remained at the three manned castles of the [[Night's Watch]] (not only in [[Castle Black]]). Jon's answer is "500 at Castle Black. 200 at [[Shadow Tower]], perhaps 300 at [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea|Eastwatch]]". That was a deliberate lie. The actual number of the brothers who remained at the castles was no more than 700: 400 at Castle Black, 100 at Shadow Tower, less than 200 at Eastwatch.
*In the TV series, [[Ygritte]] refers to the [[Lord of Bones]] as Rattleshirt. In the books, only the Night's Watch brothers call him by that nickname for mockery, not the [[Free Folk|wildlings]].
*Ygritte didn't take Jon's sword to lure him into the caves. The wildlings were camped in the caves for the night.
*The chamber where Jon and Ygritte were was pitch black, with only their torch for light.
*The first time Jon and Ygritte made love was in the middle of the other wildlings, under their sleeping furs at night.
*Ygritte never mentions the second man she slept with, only her first.
*It was not [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] but Lem that stops [[Arya Stark|Arya]] from attacking [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]].
*Arya told the Hound "You go to hell!". [[Beric Dondarrion|Beric]] said "He has", either referring to the event [[Gregor Clegane]] shoved Sandor's head into a brazier, or speaking metaphorically about the Hound's life.
*Arya first learned of Gendry's intent to join the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|Brotherhood]] when he asked to be knighted by Beric.
*[[Rickard Karstark]] is brought before [[Robb Stark|Robb]] in front of a full court in the novel.
*In the novels, the murder of the captives by Rickard Karstark occurs off-screen.
*Rickard Karstark killed [[Willem Lannister]] and his cousin Tion Frey (son of Genna Lannister and Emmon Frey), not [[Martyn Lannister]]. Martyn was unharmed, and later was exchanged for [[Robett Glover]].
*In the show, Robb says that he saw [[Harrion Karstark]] die on the battlefield. In the books, Harrion has been taken captive at the battle of Duskendale, and his fate is unknown. His brothers, Eddard and [[Torrhen Karstark|Torrhen]], were killed by Jaime in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]].
*[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] and [[Talisa Stark|Robb's wife]] (Jeyne Westerling in the book) did not try to persuade Robb to spare Rickard, only [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] tried to.
*Robb does not use his sword to behead Rickard Karstark in the novel. He uses an axe, and takes several swings to take his head completely. 
*In the books, eight men killed the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] prisoners. When taking them into custody, Greatjon's men killed two of them, and fatally injured another.
*In the book, Rickard Karstark and his men kill not only the two prisoners, but also two of their guards, Elwood and Delp; Edmure tells that to Robb. In the show, only one guard is killed, and his killing is not mentioned when Rickard stands before Robb.
*In the book, Rickard claims that killing the Lannister prisoners and their guards was not a murder or a treason, for "Any man who steps between a father and his vengeance asks for death" and "How can it be treason to kill Lannisters?". In the show, Rickard says the two aforementioned sentences in a different context - after Jaime unsuccessfully attempts to escape and gets caught ("[[A Man Without Honor]]").
*It is [[Greatjon Umber]], not the [[Brynden Tully|Blackfish]], who punches Karstark for calling Robb "boy", breaking one of his teeth.
*Karstark's forces did not account for half of Robb's army in the novels. Indeed, it is absurd that one noble House could make up almost half of the Northern army. This might be explained away by Robb meaning that it was almost half of his ''current'' garrison at [[Riverrun]] itself. In the books, the Karstarks have around 2,300 men (less than the Freys, who have 4,000). Robb brought twenty thousand Northerners south, and they were joined by a perhaps equal number of soldiers raised by the Riverlords. They have been taking some losses in the war, and Robb has divided his forces between Riverrun in the west and [[Harrenhal]] in the east.
*Some of the Karstark soldiers have already left the garrison at Riverrun after the massacre of the Lannister prisoners.
*Robb occasionally consults with his mother, Edmure and Brynden about military affairs, but never with his wife.
*Catelyn, not Robb's wife, urges him to return to the North rather than continue fighting the Lannisters, and he agrees.
*Robb's plan was not to attack [[Casterly Rock]] in the books, it was to re-take the [[North]] from the [[ironborn]]. At this point, Robb had returned to Riverrun from his campaign harrying the [[Westerlands]]. Casterly Rock and [[Lannisport]] were left with only a skeleton defending force, but even so, Robb was reluctant to attack its solid defenses with the few men he had, particularly as he had to divide his forces when the [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]] attacked the North. The TV series presents this as a last-ditch effort spurred by the defeat of Stannis by the Lannisters and the loss of the Karstarks. Robb's plan in the books was indeed to return to the North, to drive the Greyjoys out and rebuild his power base from a more defensible location. There was some concern that soldiers would abandon the fight to gather harvests for winter, but the reasoning was that they'd at least still defend the North itself if the Lannisters tried to advance through the [[Neck]]. Thus, in the books, Robb doesn't just need the Freys' soldiers, he physically needs to cross back over the [[Twins]] to retake the west coast of the North from the Ironborn.
*The [[House Frey|Freys]] had already pledged their forces to support Robb, but left his side soon after he broke their marriage pact. This apparently occurred "off-screen" at some point before Season 3 episode "[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]", when Robb's marriage to Talisa is presented as public knowledge ([[House Bolton|Bolton]] and Karstark refer to her as Robb's wife). In the books, in sharp contrast to the show, the Freys react very furiously to the breaching of the pact, and leave Robb's host very demonstratively; moreover, the loss of the Frey alliance is treated as a major disaster, costing them some four thousand badly needed troops. The TV series treated it like Robb wasn't particularly concerned, even though it was arguably worse than losing the Karstarks, given that the Freys have more men and control a vital strategic passage into and out of the North.
*The TV series presents a shallower argument for why Lord Karstark must be executed, making it appear to be an even worse mistake. In the books, as in the series, Edmure and Catelyn fear that the Lannisters may respond by executing [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] or other Northern prisoners in retaliation, but the books give more motives, it is not Robb's main reason for executing Rickard: he feels that he must kill Rickard to atone for the two Lannister prisoners he murdered, and also because Rickard tainted his honor; that, and although it is not said explicitly - Robb needs to maintain basic discipline in his command, and can't let such direct treason go unpunished otherwise he will look weak. Then again, the TV series already built up Catelyn's release of Jaime Lannister to be far worse than it was in the books, in which after being told that [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] died at [[Winterfell]], Catelyn fears (not unjustifiably) that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] might kill Sansa simply on a whim, despite the fact that they hold Jaime hostage, so the only safe option is to get her daughters out of harm's way as soon as possible. Catelyn fears that Arya may be dead too, after Cleos Frey tells her that he only saw Sansa when he visited the court. Both decisions did have practical underlying reasons in the books, not pure emotion or ideology, so presenting Robb's decision to execute Karstark as having no practical merits sort of evens out for how much worse Catelyn's decision has been presented. In the books, Robb also has sex with then marries Jeyne/Talisa out of grief when he hears that Bran and Rickon are dead, so neither Catelyn or Robb feel they can justifiably be angry at the other, because they both made brash mistakes.
*Beric's second death was caused by a smash in the head with a mace by Ser [[Burton Crakehall]].
**He wasn't hit with an axe, nor was he hung and stabbed in the eye at the same time. Those deaths occurred on two separate occasions: [[Amory Lorch]] hanged him at the Rushing Falls (the third death), and [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] drove a dirk into his eye (the fourth death). It may have been too difficult to portray the actor with a caved-in skull using practical effects.
*In the show, Beric says "Second time I've been killed by a Clegane" after he is killed by the Hound and resurrected. In the books, he says "That's thrice I have died at the hands of House Clegane", since the Mountain killed him twice before.
*[[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse]] is often by [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s side in the books.
*Stannis never apologized to Selyse about anything. The books are ambiguous about if Stannis is consciously aware that Melisandre had sex with him to create a Shadow-creature, or if due to the magical powers involved, he didn't clearly remember what happened.
*It is uncertain whether Selyse found out that Stannis was sleeping with Melisandre, and if she cared.
*Selyse did not keep her stillborn children in jars in the novels. In fact it is never mentioned in the novels that she ever gave birth to stillborns, nor to any liveborn except [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]]. She mentions "Edric" as the name of one of her stillborns. Edric Storm is a bastard-son of Stannis' brother Robert, who was kept on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] for safekeeping in the novels, but who was removed from the TV series; Edric is actually a fairly common name in the [[Stormlands]].
*The song Shireen sings in the show, and is also played during the ending credits, was sung by her fool Patchface in the prologue of ''A Clash of Kings''. The line about the merwives amused Shireen, but she was scared of the line, ''"The shadows come to dance"''.
*Stannis never told Shireen that [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] was a traitor in the novels, nor did Davos ever give her a toy ship. In fact, Stannis never has any conversation with his daughter throughout the books.
*Shireen never visits Davos in the books, nor does she attempt to teach him how to read. Maester [[Pylos]] is the one who offered Davos to teach him, much later. Melisandre is the only visitor Davos has while he is imprisoned.
*Several days after Davos has been thrown to jail, Alester Florent (Selyse's uncle), formerly Stannis's hand, is brought to the cell. He tells Davos that Stannis unjustly had him imprisoned for treason: following the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Alester wrote a letter he planned to send to Tywin - without Stannis's knowledge or consent - offering peace and suggesting that Stannis would swear fealty to Joffrey and take back what he said about Joffrey's parents, but would remain Lord of Dragonstone and Storm's End, and that the Florents would get Brightwater Keep back. In addition, he offered Shireen's hand in marriage to [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. Davos tells Alester that Stannis would have never agreed to bend his knee to Joffrey, nor to the other terms. Alester whimpers, claiming that he was just trying to help Stannis and had no intention of treason. In the series, Alester does not appear, and the whole scene is omitted.
*In the books, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is the one who delivers the retort about not "losing" his hand, as Vargo Hoat/[[Locke]] had hung it around his neck. Writer Bryan Cogman said that they gave the line to Locke in the TV series, because they wanted to emphasize that Jaime was still in such emotional shock from losing his sword-hand that he wouldn't so quickly switch back to his normal self, spouting off sarcastic remarks (in the book version, this is told from Jaime's POV, and he clearly ''is'' shaken, and continues to half-heartedly make a few sarcastic remarks as a failed attempt to regain some of his lost composure, but this subtle nuance would have been difficult to portray on-screen).<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Season_3_Interview_Bryan_Cogman Westeros.org,] Season 3 Interview: Bryan Cogman.</ref>
*In the book, Roose Bolton does not toy with Jaime, but tells him right away that Cersei is well.
*Jaime's story about killing [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] is given in the novel in two parts:
**During the journey with [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] and Cleos Frey, Jaime muses how he approached Aerys, who had sent him earlier to kill [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]. Aerys asked if the blood on Jaime's sword was Tywin's. Jaime answers "[[Rossart]]'s". Too late Aerys realized that Jaime turned against him. He lost control of his bowels, tried to run for the throne, but Jaime caught him, bodily threw him to the floor and killed him with a single slash to the throat. Before Jaime could leave and let some braggart take the credit/blame, Ser [[Elys Westerling]] and Lord [[Roland Crakehall]] entered and saw him standing over Aerys's body. Crakehall was not surprised, figuring (incorrectly) that Jaime killed the king so the Lannisters can seize the throne. He asked Jaime "Shall I proclaim a new king as well?". Jaime knew what he meant: either Tywin, or [[Robert Baratheon]], or one of the surviving Targaryens. He thought for a moment of the boy [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] or baby [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon]]. But when he glanced down again at Aerys's body, he thought "his blood is in both of them" (presumably referring to the [[Targaryen madness]]). "Proclaim who you bloody well like," he told Crakehall. Then he climbed the Iron Throne and seated himself with his sword across his knees, to see who would come to claim the kingdom. As it happened, it had been [[Eddard Stark]].
**Jaime tells Brienne when they are in the bathtub about Aerys's plan to destroy the city. This part is quite similar to their conversation in the show.
*Jaime did not kill Rossart in front of Aerys in the books, nor was he present when Aerys gave the command to ignite the [[wildfire]] caches; in the books, Jaime was fighting to defend the [[Red Keep]], but he knew the battle was lost. He sent a messenger to ask Aerys's leave to negotiate terms of surrender; Aerys sent back the reply that Jaime bring him Tywin's head to prove his loyalty. When the messenger mentioned the [[Wisdom|pyromancer]] Rossart was with the king, Jaime guessed they were about to go through with their plan, and went to stop them. He killed Rossart trying to sneak out of the Red Keep to enact Aerys's orders.
*There were three pyromancers involved in [[Wildfire plot|Aerys's plot to raze]] [[King's Landing]], not one as the TV series implies. Jaime slew Rossart during the [[Sack of King's Landing|Sack]] along with Aerys, and then hunted down and killed the other two (Belis and Garigus) in the days following the battle, to ensure all those who know of and could enact the plan were dead. According to Jaime, Garigus begged and Belis offered gold in futile efforts to convince him to spare their lives.
*Eddard Stark was not the first to find Jaime after killing Aerys. Ser Elys Westerling and Lord Roland Crakehall were the first to enter the throne room and see Jaime standing over the Mad King's body.
*Jaime's final line in the bath scene whimpering "Jaime. My name is Jaime." was given in his inner POV monologue in the books, not aloud. Bryan Cogman explained that he felt it was a great line and wanted it to appear on-screen, but felt he had some leeway because Jaime is delirious and losing consciousness, so he's really just saying it to himself. Cogman actually noted that this is a constant balancing act in the adaptation, because some of the most thematically important lines in many chapters are internal thoughts that characters do not speak aloud. Thus the writers have to be careful over using an insult which is a great line, but which a character would never openly say aloud to another. Also from this episode, Tyrion's line to Tywin in the finale scene, "I was married once! Or don't you remember?" is actually a line from his inner POV monologue in the books, but Cogman felt it was important enough to include it in dialogue.<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/GoT/Features/Entry/Season_3_Interview_Bryan_Cogman Westeros.org,] Season 3 Interview: Bryan Cogman.</ref>
*Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] did sit on the [[Small Council]] in the books; he was present at the meeting where Daenerys's assassination was discussed, heard [[Jorah Mormont]] was the source of the information and was the only one besides Eddard Stark to protest the decision. Ser Barristan and Jorah Mormont also never befriended each other while serving under [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] because he is still disguised as Arstan Whitebeard. This TV scene specifically acknowledges that Barristan ''should'' have been on the Small Council in Season 1 episode "[[The Wolf and the Lion]]", but that the writers changed it so he was not, because they felt it would be awkward to have Barristan pretend to be "Arstan Whitebeard" for an entire season, when Daenerys doesn't know who he is but the TV audience does know.
*In the books, it is not Barristan Selmy but Jaime who rarely attends the meetings of the Small Council (although he has the right to, as the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard) because politics bore him.
*In the TV series, the [[Unsullied]] are given new names after being castrated. In the books, they draw new names every day. 
*The scene where [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] asks [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] to investigate the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] never happens in the novels.
*The scene where [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] discusses the wedding with [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna]] never happens in the book.
*Littlefinger never sent Olyvar (or anyone else) to [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] in the books. The only book character by that name is [[Olyvar Frey]], son of [[Walder Frey]], who served as Robb's squire and proved to be very loyal. He never had anything to do with the Tyrells or Littlefinger.
*The scenes between Loras and Olyvar never happen in the novels. At this point in the books, Loras swears that he will never love again after [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]'s death. Of course, having sex with Olyvar in the TV series wasn't presented as a new "romantic relationship", but it is highly unlikely that Loras in the books would have become intimate even on a casual basis with someone new, let alone so soon after losing the love of his life. The books never say or imply that Loras becomes involved with anyone else after Renly is killed.
*Loras was not the heir of [[Highgarden]] in the books, his elder brother Willas was. In fact, he had two older brothers, Willas and Garlan. In any case, Loras gave up his inheritance rights when he joined the Kingsguard.
*Loras cannot marry since he is already serving in the [[Kingsguard]].
*The Lannisters discovered Olenna's plan to marry Sansa to Willas by [[Dontos Hollard]]; Sansa innocently told him about the Tyrells' offer, unaware that he serves Littlefinger.
*Since Tyrion did not like the idea of marrying Sansa, Tywin said that if he would not have her, she would be wed to [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]] or another of Tyrion's cousins. [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] was not sure if that would work, as Lancel had not yet recovered from the injuries he sustained at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].
*Tywin did not intend to marry Cersei to Loras, but to his older brother [[Willas Tyrell]] or [[Balon Greyjoy]] or [[Oberyn Martell]] by her choice, and it was much later in the novel. Cersei was not thrilled by either alternative "the old squid or the crippled dog boy".
*In the books, Rickard Karstark reminds Robb that he was named after his grandfather [[Rickard Stark]] as well as the fact they are kin before his [[execution]]. In the show, he only reminds Robb they are kin and makes no mention of Rickard Stark.
*In the books, Rickard Karstark explicitly warns Robb that a kinslayer is accursed; in the show, he just mentions they are kin.

==="[[The Climb]]"===
*The bickering between [[Meera Reed]] and [[Osha]] does not occur in the novel. In fact, Osha, [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]] and [[Shaggydog]] are not even part of [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s party, having left on a different course after the [[Sack of Winterfell]].
*Meera did not hunt any rabbits, but fish and frogs.
*Jojen had no dreams about [[Jon Snow|Jon]].
*[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] never has a conversation with [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna]] concerning [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. At this stage in the book, Loras is already in the [[Kingsguard]] so he cannot marry anyone. Cersei was offered to [[Willas Tyrell]] instead, a character that has been cut from the series, so this serves as a highly condensed version of that subplot.
*Tywin made [[Mace Tyrell]] the offer of marrying Cersei to Willas, but Olenna foiled it by convincing Mace Cersei was "too old and too used" for her precious one-legged grandson (it's implied she also scuppered the offer as revenge on Tywin for thwarting her plan to marry Willas to Sansa). Tywin grudgingly dropped the offer and never mentioned it again.
*[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] never confronted Cersei about [[Mandon Moore]].
*Cersei never admitted that Tyrion saved the city by using [[wildfire]]. According to Tywin, she was (unjustly) given the credit for that.
*Loras never acquaints himself with [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] to the extent shown in the show. Sansa was not even offered Loras by the Tyrells, but his elder brother and the heir to [[Highgarden]], Willas Tyrell.
*Loras never mentions any interest in clothes or jewelery in the books.
*Sansa was never given early warning about her impending wedding to Tyrion. On the marriage day, she was taken from her room under threat of force right to the ceremony.
*[[Shae]] knew about Tyrion's impending wedding to Sansa before he told her. She told him that she had heard a page telling Ser Tallad about it, who had heard it from a serving girl who overheard [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] talking to Tywin about it. 
*Shae is not mad about Tyrion and Sansa's impending marriage. In fact she is indifferent, telling him "I don't care. She's only a little girl. You'll give her a big belly and come back to me". That proves to Tyrion once more that Shae does not have any feelings toward him.
*[[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] does not give his chaos speech to [[Varys]].
*Littlefinger didn't offer Sansa a chance to go with him when he left King's Landing. At this point in the books, he was already gone from King's Landing.
*[[Ros]] does not exist in the book, so her execution in the episode was new material.
*Interestingly, in the books [[Arya Stark]] actually does know some basic [[High Valyrian]], which she learned as part of her lessons with Maester [[Luwin]]. Then again she's stated to not know it very well, as she's only a child and hasn't been studying it for many years, so it's debatable if even book-Arya would have been able to understand two other people speaking in fluent High Valyrian.
*Arya does not practice shooting arrows. In fact she has not shot even one single arrow throughout the entire book series. Anguy let her try his longbow, but she could not draw it no matter how much she tried. He offered to make a lighter bow for her, but did not.
*[[Melisandre]] never visits the [[Riverlands]] in the books. Thus, she never meets [[Arya Stark|Arya]], [[Thoros]], [[Beric Dondarrion|Dondarrion]], [[Anguy]], or any other of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]. This episode's scene may be meant to mirror the scenes between the Ghost of High Heart, Arya and the Brotherhood from the books. [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] isn't taken by Melisandre or anyone else from the brotherhood in the novels. His usefulness for [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and Melisandre's plans is filled by Edric Storm, another of Robert's bastards.
*Edric Storm was taken from Storm's End to Dragonstone before the battle of the Blackwater, and not by Melisandre. He never had anything to do with the Brotherhood.
*The old woods witch known as the Ghost of High Heart, not Melisandre, is the one who looks closely at Arya and sees darkness in her. She is frightened of what she sees, and tells Arya to begone.
*[[Melisandre]] says [[Thoros]] was sent to [[Westeros]] to convert King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] to the religion of the [[Lord of Light]]. In the books, he was sent to convert the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] (the faithful of the Lord of Light believed Aerys' obsession with fire would make him a willing convert). Thoros did still hang around the royal court under King Robert and became one of his drinking companions, but he had even less luck preaching about the [[Lord of Light]] to Robert than he did to Aerys.
*[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] did not try to persuade [[Roose Bolton]] to let [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] go with him.
*Roose said that Brienne would stay in [[Harrenhal]] for Vargo Hoat's entertainment, not under arrest for abetting treason.
*The [[House Stark|Starks]], not the [[House Frey|Freys]], were the first to offer that [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]], instead of Robb, could marry one of [[Walder Frey|Lord Frey's daughters]]. The Freys accepted the offer.
*[[Brynden Tully]] never threatened Edmure. On the contrary, he said "I am the last man in the [[Seven Kingdoms]] to tell anyone who they must wed, nephew. Nonetheless, you did say something of making amends for your Battle of the Fords".
*Walder Frey never wanted [[Harrenhal]] in the book.
*[[Walder Rivers|Black Walder]] was not on a visit in [[Riverrun]] to negotiate the wedding with [[Lothar Frey]]. It was [[Walder Rivers]].
*Before discussing Edmure's marriage, Lothar tells the Starks about the [[sack of Winterfell|destruction of Winterfell]] (and about Ser Rodrik's death). He falsely claims that the ironborn burned the castle and killed most of its occupants, and that Ramsay took the survivors to the Dreadfort. He claims that he no idea what has become of Theon; later, Roose Bolton tells the Starks more details.
*Neither [[Orell]] nor any other of the wildlings cuts loose the rope to which [[Ygritte]] and Jon are clinging to. Orell's character was long dead, slain by Jon's scouting party in ''A Clash of Kings''.
*Ygritte hates the [[Wall]] in the books, and never had any dreams of standing on top of it. She also never reveals to Jon that she knows where his true loyalties lie.
*Jarl is leading the climb up the Wall in the books, not [[Tormund]].
*Jon and Ygritte are not among the dozen [[Free Folk|wildlings]] who first scale the Wall.
*While the wildling climbers were scaling the Wall, large parts of ice broke off the Wall. As a result, Jarl and three other climbers fell and were killed. Once the remaining climbers reached the top, they threw ropes to the wildlings on the ground. Ladders were pulled to the top of the Wall, and only then Jon, Ygritte and the other wildlings climbed much more safely and conveniently (though the climb was still dangerous and cost two more lives) than in the series.
*In the books, Jon and Ygritte reach the top of the Wall around midnight, not in daylight.
*After Jon and Ygritte reach the top of the Wall, she reveals what the secret power is that the wildlings have been looking for in the [[Frostfangs]] - the legendary Horn of Winter, used many years ago by [[Joramun]] to wake giants.

==="[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]"===
*[[Robb Stark|Robb]]'s wife Jeyne Westerling, changed to "[[Talisa Stark|Talisa Maegyr]]" in the TV series, never told him that she was pregnant. Jeyne's mother claims she has made certain her daughter would not get pregnant (presumably by giving her Moon tea), but in theory it is ''possible'' that Jeyne is pregnant in the later books, which chronologically would mean she became pregnant around this time if she has.
*Neither Orell (who was killed by Jon in ''A Clash of Kings'') nor any of the wildlings ever disapproved of the growing romance between Jon and Ygritte. Indeed, Tormund encouraged it, and was confused by Jon's initial reticence towards Ygritte.
*The scene with [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] does not specifically happen in the books, but is loosely adapted from flashbacks given in later books. The books never outright state that Theon's torturers castrated him, but it was twice alluded to in ''A Dance with Dragons''.
*There are minor book characters named Myranda and Violet, but they do not have anything to do with the [[House Bolton|Boltons]] and Theon's torturing.
*The conversation between [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] about the marriage to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] does not occur in the books. Sansa never discussed it with anyone, because she was not told until the wedding itself, and the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] distanced themselves from Sansa after their plot was discovered.
*The conversation between [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] and [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] does not occur in the books.
*The conversation between Tyrion and [[Bronn]] does not occur in the books.
*In the books, Tyrion never gave any chain to [[Shae]]. This chain later plays role in an important event in Season 4 episode "[[The Children]]", while in the books, a different chain is used in that event. Please refer to the corresponding section in [[Differences in adaptation/Game of Thrones: Season 4|Differences in adaptation/''Game of Thrones'' Season 4]] for details.
*Shae was not upset at all about Tyrion's impending marriage to Sansa. On the contrary, she told him indifferently: "I don't care. She's only a little girl. You'll give her a big belly and come back to me." Tyrion was quite upset at Shae's indifference, which proved to him that she does not have any true feelings to him.
*There is no mentioning in the book that there are 200,000 slaves in [[Yunkai]].
*Daenerys' meeting with the Yunkish envoy is different in the novel. First, the Yunkai'i meet her with an army of slave soldiers and sellswords at their back. Second, they do not offer her any ships to carry her to Westeros on condition that she leaves the Slaver's Bay (that offer is made in the fifth novel by [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]), but one chest of 50,000 gold marks (not bullions) which she does not keep when she rejects their terms. Third, she orders Drogon to breathe fire on the envoy as he leaves, setting his tokar (a Ghiscari garment) on fire.
*The Yunkai envoy's name is the books is Grazdan mo Eraz. There are several characters with the given name Grazdan in the books, and two of them have made an appearance in the TV series, and both are renamed, probably for avoiding confusion.
*Osha never mentions any husband or other relatives.
*There is no goodbye conversation between Jaime and Brienne before he leaves Harrenhal.
*As Jaime leaves Harrenhal, he says goodbye to the Brave Companions, promising them "I will be back. A Lannister always pays his debts".
*Jaime never told Qyburn or anyone else, except Brienne, that he saved the residents of King's Landing.
*Jaime does not ask Qyburn if he was expelled from the Citadel because "he fondled one boy too many". That comment may refer to the pedophile Septon Utt (who was omitted from the series), another member of the Brave Companions, who used to molest and murder children until he was caught and hanged by the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].
*Jaime decides to rescue Brienne after having a fevered dream of her, not after hearing from Qyburn that Vargo Hoat/Locke had rejected the ransom her father offered, as due to Jaime's lie about sapphires he was expecting more. Jaime is irritated to hear this, but reasons that Brienne is strong enough to survive a few rapes, and may even break Hoat's neck if he underestimates her. Jaime does not change his mind until after the dream.
*While Jaime is gone, Vargo Hoat tries to rape Brienne, but she fights him and bites off one of his ears. When Jaime returns to Harrenhal, he notices that Hoat's left side of his head is covered with bloody bandages.
*Brienne's fight with the bear is different in the book:
**Brienne fights the bear with a blunt metal tourney blade. Jaime only notices this after she stabs the bear without causing any injury.
**When Jaime arrives, he is accompanied by 200 Northmen commanded by Steelshanks who outnumber the Brave Companions by 2:1.
**Steelshanks and several other Northmen kill the bear with a dozen or so crossbow bolts.
**Jaime and Brienne do not climb out of the arena, since the bear is killed and they do not need to do so.
*[[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] has not learned so far that he is [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s bastard.
*[[Orell]] never takes an interest in [[Ygritte]], since he was killed by Jon in ''A Clash of Kings''.
*In the books, it is not Margaery but her brother Garlan (who has been omitted from the show) who tells Sansa that Tyrion might make a good husband. Also, in the books, it happens later, at the wedding itself.

==="[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"===
*The Hound does not give Arya a chance to kill him, but takes the rock from her and warns her "if you're stupid enough to try again, I'll hurt you".
*The [[Second Sons]] are 500, not 2,000 (the Stormcrows are also 500).
*It is not [[Grey Worm]] but Strong Belwas who offers Daenerys to cut Prendahl na Ghezn's tongue when the latter talks rudely to her. When Mero talks rudely to Daenerys, none of her guards offers that.
*It is Mero who asks for a flagon of wine to bring back to his captains, to which Daenerys replies by offering a barrel as they have wagons full of it. Mero then demands a wagon-full as a sign of good faith. Daenerys waits until nightfall, after which the mercenaries are too drunk to fight, then sends her forces in to attack them. Daenerys's trick and quick-thinking is what results in the quick fall of Yunkai, not an infiltration mission by Daario.
*Daenerys orders Jorah Mormont, not Barristan, to kill Mero first - when Mero is still in the tent and hears that. Mero is unimpressed, and continues the conversation.
*The scene between [[Prendahl na Ghezn]], Daario Naharis and Mero picking coins to decide who would assassinate Daenerys does not happen in the book. It is Mero and not Daario who sneaks into Daenerys's camp after his defeat and flight from the Battle of Yunkai. Mero almost slays Daenerys before he is stopped and slain by Barristan Selmy (still disguised as Arstan Whitebeard). Only after that point, Selmy's true identity is revealed.
*Daario is not a lieutenant but a captain of another sellsword company called the Stormcrows along with Prendahl na Ghezn and a character called Sallor the Bald (who does not appear in the show). In the novels, it is these two characters that Daario beheads to gain the trust of Daenerys. He sneaked into her camp (with no malicious intent), but was caught by the Unsullied. He showed Daenerys the severed heads, and declared "the Stormcrows are yours". Mero was not part of the Stormcrows but a commander of the Second Sons, and so was not slain by Daario.
*Daario does not take Missandei hostage, nor any of Daenerys' servants.
*Sansa does not tell Tyrion he looks handsome, because she figures that if she says such a thing, he will think she is either a fool or a liar. This is connected to the fact that Tyrion is much uglier in the books, and additionally, his injury in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] was much more gruesome.
*Shortly before the ceremony, Tyrion tells Sansa that if she does not wish to marry him, they will wed her to Lancel instead, so if she prefers to marry Lancel - she can ask to.
*Sansa and Tyrion are not married at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], but a local Sept at the [[Red Keep]].
*The Tyrells aren't present at the wedding ceremony, though they do turn up for the wedding feast in the small hall. Sansa dances at the wedding with Loras Tyrell's older brother, Garlan, who does not appear in the series. Tommen (who doesn't appear at all in season 3) is also at the feast, pestering his family for the right to be married like his uncle.
*Sansa is 12 years old, not 14, when she is married to Tyrion.
*The wedding scene between Sansa and Tyrion is different in the book. Sansa is far more distraught throughout the ceremony, and outright refuses to bend down when Tyrion attempts to cloak her, her only act of defiance throughout the entire ceremony. Thus Tyrion had no choice but to stand on [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos]]'s back in order to cloak Sansa in the colors of House Lannister, while everyone had a good laugh. There was no chair that Joffrey took in the show.
*After Tyrion thrusts his dagger into the table and tells Joffrey "Then you'll service your own bride with a wooden prick", he adds "I'll geld you, I swear it".
*Tyrion and Sansa get fully undressed and enter bed, and Tyrion gropes Sansa's breast. Although she does not explicitly say "no", he realizes that she does not wish to have sex with him, and he does not want to force himself upon her.
*When Sansa asks Tyrion what if she never wants him to touch her, he answers "that is why the gods made whores for imps like me" and climbs down off the bed. He never says, "And so my watch begins," or falls down drunk.
*Neither Shae nor anyone else checks Tyrion and Sansa's bed for stains of maidenhood blood. However, rumor spreads around (probably by Sansa's maids, all of whom are Cersei's spies) that Tyrion has not consummated his marriage.
*The scenes between Gendry and Melisandre never happen in the book, although there is some truth to them. In the TV series, there are leeches gorging on Gendry's blood, but in the book, there are leeches gorging on Edric Storm's blood, an acknowledged bastard of King Robert present on Dragonstone. Edric's bloodletting is performed as medical treatment, but off-screen. Stannis comments offhandedly that Edric coughs, shivers, has a fever, and Maester [[Pylos]] has been leeching him.
*Melisandre never gets intimate with anyone except Stannis (and that is only implied to take place off-screen).
*Sam's encounter with the White Walker/Other is significantly different in the novel:
**Firstly, the encounter occurs in much earlier point, shortly after the [[fight at the Fist]], during the retreat of the surviving brothers, with the Others in pursuit, picking off anyone who falls behind. Instead of Gilly, Sam is accompanied by Grenn and a steward named Small Paul, who carries Sam during the retreat. The Other kills Paul, then Sam stabs it with his dragonglass dagger as it struggles to free its sword from Paul's corpse, destroying it. They wait till the dagger is warm enough to touch, then Grenn picks it up.
**The creature that Sam encounters with Gilly is a wight (a human slain by a White Walker and has risen again at their command), formerly Small Paul.
**In the novel, Sam attempts to use his dragonglass dagger in this scene to kill the wight, but fails since dragonglass is only effective against white walkers, and it shatters when he tries to stab the wight with it. Sam tries his steel dagger, but for no avail, for Wights are not affected by stabbing of normal weapon. Luckily, Sam manages to grab a burning wood and thrusts it into the Wight's mouth, thus destroying it, but as soon as he steps outside - there are many more wights surrounding him and Gilly. Sam recognizes most of them as his fallen black brothers (Chett, Lark, Softfoot, Ryles, and others).
**At that point, a mysterious person (known as "[[Benjen Stark#In the books|Coldhands]]") appears, accompanied by countless ravens. The ravens swarm and attack the Wights, tearing them apart, saving Sam and Gilly. Then Coldhands takes them to the Nightfort.
*Sam does not have a sword (he lost it at the Fist), but a dragonglass dagger and a steel dagger.
*The White Walker does not shatter, but melts down when Sam stabs it.
*TV viewers might think it foolish that Sam left the dragonglass dagger on the ground where the White Walker died, instead of recovering such a valuable weapon. In the books, Grenn is present and tries to pick it up, but immediately flings it back to the ground because it is so cold from touching the Walker; it remains there on the ground wreathed in steam. Sam and Grenn wait till the dagger is warm enough to touch, then Sam tells Grenn to pick it up. Since so few dragonglass daggers were in the secret bundle that Jon found at the Fist, Sam wouldn't so carelessly leave behind the only weapon (as far as he knew at that time) that is lethal to the Others. The TV series reveals two episodes later in "[[Mhysa]]" that Samwell simply had multiple dragonglass daggers in his possession, so it was no particular loss that he didn't go back for the one he killed the Walker with. Still, given that there are so many White Walkers - it was not wise to lose even one dragonglass dagger.
*Given that these scenes were moved around, so Sam killed a White Walker as they were retreating from the Fist in the books, Grenn picked up and kept the dagger Sam used to kill the White Walker. Sam later takes Lord Commander Mormont's dragonglass dagger when he dies at Craster's Keep, which Mormont had been given by Jon Snow; that dagger shatters when Sam uses it against the wight.
*House Tarbeck participated the rebellion, alongside House Reyne, against the Lannisters.
*The Reyne-Tarbeck rebellion is mentioned in the novels by several characters (Tyrion, Jaime, Roose Bolton), but not by Cersei.
*The scene where Cersei threatens Margaery and informs her about [[House Reyne]] of Castamere does not happen in the novels, although the scene still voices a good deal of Cersei's interior monologues regarding Margaery and provides important backstory on the song. Cersei never threatens Margaery aloud, nor does she mention the Reyne rebellion.
*In the books, Cersei was born six years after the Reynes and Tarbecks were destroyed by Tywin, hence she could not have seen the rotting bodies.
*Stannis never comes to visit Davos in jail.
*Melisandre is the only visitor Davos has while he is imprisoned. She denies Davos' accusation that she is responsible for Stannis's defeat at the Battle of the Blackwater, and for the death of four of Davos's sons. She explains to Davos why she cannot make more [[Shadow]]s (because it weakened Stannis too much), and offers him to have sex with her for making a shadow. Davos rejects her offer, because he does not wish to have anything to do with Melisandre and her dark witchcraft.
*Stannis does not express sorrow for the death of Davos's four sons (just one son in the series) at the Battle of the Blackwater.
*Stannis does not order Davos to swear that he will never harm Melisandre.
*Stannis is more doubtful about killing an innocent boy, and does not give Melisandre permission to do it yet.
*It is not Davos but Stannis who wants a demonstration of the power in king's blood. Davos witnesses the ritual, but has not been given any explanations about it, thus has no idea what its purpose is.
*The order in which Stannis names the "false kings" while burning the leeches is opposite to the order in the show: Joffrey, Balon and Robb. He also hesitates before naming Robb Stark, maybe because he realizes Robb's treason is not as bad as the others.
*Gilly wouldn't give [[Sam|her baby]] a name before he is two years old, according to the wildlings custom that she follows in regards to the high rates of infant mortality.

==="[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]"===
*The Hound does not intend to kill the farmer. Instead, he forces the farmer at swordpoint to give his cart, horses, casks and most of his clothes. Arya does not intervene. The farmer curses the Hound, but reluctantly complies. Neither of them knocks the farmer unconscious or otherwise physically harms him.
*Arya has never heard how the Hound's face got burnt.
*The guard does not send the Hound back, but tells him to unload the food by the feast tents.
*Arya does not get close enough to see Grey Wind.
*Three of the Frey soldiers notice the Hound and attack him. One of them chases Arya and nearly kills her. The Hound kills the three and saves Arya, then knocks her unconscious.
*Catelyn does not encourage Robb to keep fighting the Lannisters, on the contrary: she tells him bluntly "Your first duty is to defend your own people, win back Winterfell, and hang Theon in a crow's cage to die slowly. Or else put off that crown for good, Robb, for men will know that you are no true king at all". Robb agrees, and expresses remorse for not returning to the North as soon as he was informed about the fall of Winterfell.
*Before heading for the Twins, Robb tells Catelyn he decided to legitimize Jon and make him his legal successor. Catelyn objects due to her feelings toward Jon, but Robb dismisses her objection, and issues a royal decree naming Jon his successor. It is unknown what became of the decree. Robb orders [[Maege Mormont]] and [[Galbart Glover]] to travel north to [[Howland Reed]]. He might have given them the decree.
*The musicians at the wedding are noted to be terrible (since they are really archers in disguise), while in the TV series they are quite talented.
*The Starks meet Roslin shortly after their arrival, long before the ceremony.
*Four of the Freys (Ryman, Edwyn, Petyr Pimple and Black Walder) welcome the Starks. As they get closer, Grey Wind acts menacingly and causes Petyr's horse to rear and throw its rider. Apparently, Grey Wind senses that foul play is afoot. Unfortunately, the incident makes a convenient excuse for Lord Frey to demand that Grey Wind will be kept out of the wedding hall. Robb does not like it, but complies because he wishes to appease Lord Frey for breaching their pact.
*Catelyn recalls that Eddard forbade a bedding ceremony at their own wedding. In the books, they did have one. She muses about it during Edmure's wedding: how [[Jory Cassel]] had torn her gown in his haste to get her out of it, a drunken Desmond Grell kept apologizing for every bawdy joke, only to make another, and when Lord Willam Dustin had beheld her naked, he'd told Ned that her breasts were enough to make him wish he'd never been weaned.
*The "Rains of Castamere" song was a signal in the book to start the massacre and was played during the slaughter. In TV series, the signal was Lord Walder's speech after the music had ended.
*A few of the wedding guests, among them [[Greatjon Umber]] and Dacey Mormont, fight the assailants, but to no avail. In the TV series, Greatjon does not attend the wedding.
*Roose Bolton's last words before killing Robb are different in the book. In the book, he says "[[Jaime Lannister]] sends his regards", while in the show he says "The Lannisters send their regards".
*Walder Frey is much older and weaker in the novel, being unable to rise from his chair without help.
*Lord Frey has several granddaughters and great-granddaughters named Walda, but no daughter by that name.
*There are no [[Arwaya Frey]], [[Derwa Frey]], [[Waldra Frey]], [[Janeya Frey]], [[Neyela Frey]] and [[Freya Frey]] in the books.
*Lord Frey introduces the following of his descendants:
**Daughters: Arwyn, [[Shirei Frey|Shirei]], and Tyta.
**Granddaughters: Ami, [[Marianne Frey|Marianne]], Cersei (aka Little Bee), [[Merry Frey|Merry]], Alyx, Marissa, the twins [[Serra Frey|Serra]] and [[Sarra Frey|Sarra]], and three girls named Walda.
*When introducing his twin granddaughters Serra and Sarra, Lord Walder does not remark that Robb could have had either, or both. In another context, Bran makes a similar comment about Lord Frey's grandsons, "Big" Walder and "Little" Walder Frey, who are briefly fostered at Winterfell.
*Grey Wind was not chained in a box in the novel. He was actually chained but released by Raynald Westerling, Robb's wife's brother, when it became clear the House Frey men intended to kill the wolf. It is claimed Grey Wind killed four Frey wolfhounds and tore off the kennel master's arm before dying.
*Sam and Gilly are heading for Castle Black, not Nightfort. Sam knows they are north of the Wall, but he is not sure how far east or west they might have strayed from the gate of Castle Black.
*Ygritte does not defend Jon when Jon refuses to kill the old man. When Summer intervenes to save Jon and Jon manages to escape after refusing to kill the old man, someone (Jon thinks it was her) fires an arrow at him, which pierces his leg.
*Jon does not kill Orell at Queenscrown; he had killed him much earlier in the Skirling Pass when he was still with [[Qhorin]] in the book ''A Clash of Kings''. Yet, part of Orell's spirit somehow remained at his eagle. The eagle attacked Jon without provocation shortly before Jon and the Wildlings arrived at the Fist, injuring his face and almost plucking his eyes.
*It is not Orell but some of the Thenns who heard noises from the tower.
*The tower is in the center of a lake and accessed via stone causeway hidden under the water. The causeway zigzags, making it difficult to follow.
*The old man does not breed horses for the Night's Watch. He has only one horse. He appears to be a traveler, not a resident of [[Queenscrown]].
*The old man does not try to escape or to fight. He says nothing to his captors. He only looks at Jon in accusation and appeal.
*It is [[Styr]] who orders Jon to kill the old man.
*It is not the first time Bran wargs into [[Summer]].
*Ygritte kills the old man by slitting his throat, not shooting an arrow at him.
*The departure of Rickon, Osha and Shaggydog occurs much earlier, right after the Sack of Winterfell.
*Osha, Rickon and Shaggydog do not go to [[Last Hearth]]. Their destination remains unknown until the fifth book ''A Dance with Dragons''.
*It is not Roose Bolton who tells about his marriage to [[Walda Bolton]]. Walda tells that to [[Wendel Manderly]], not to Catelyn.
*Catelyn does not take Walder Frey's wife [[Joyeuse Frey|Joyeuse Erenford]] as hostage, but his half-witted grandson Aegon (aka Jinglebell). She tells Lord Frey, "On my honor as a Tully, on my honor as a Stark, I will trade your boy's life for Robb's. A son for a son." Lord Frey answers, "A son for a son, heh. But that's a grandson... and he never was much use." After Robb is killed by Roose, Catelyn keeps her word by slitting Jinglebell's throat.
*Talisa/Jeyne was not at the wedding and thus did not die in the Twins. Robb and Catelyn decided that Lord Frey would take it as a slight if Robb's wife made an appearance at the Twins. Another reason was that while Robb was strong enough to put up with Lord Frey's rebukes, Catelyn feared that he would not sit quietly if Lord Frey insulted Jeyne to her face (as it nearly happens in the show). Thus Jeyne was left behind at Riverrun.
*Brynden Tully was not present at the Red Wedding, as he stayed behind to hold Riverrun.
*It is not Brynden Tully but Roose Bolton that excuses himself and exits in search of a privy.
*Roose Bolton does not wear his normal clothing over his armor when he changes after his conversation with Catelyn. He comes back from the ''privy'' clad in full dark armor with a flowing pink cloak, showing the colors of House Bolton.
*It is not Roose Bolton but Edwyn Frey whom Catelyn grabs, feeling that he wears an armor and slaps him.
*Many important Northern bannermen were present at the Wedding but not shown on screen. These include Greatjon Umber, Smalljon Umber, Dacey Mormont, Marq Piper, and Donnel Locke. By the end of the massacre, the Freys and Boltons have killed at least one member of each house in the North.
*Only a few of the wedding guests were spared, among them: Edmure Tully, Greatjon Umber, Patrek Mallister, and Marq Piper. The Freys planned to take Catelyn prisoner.
*When Catelyn begs Lord Frey to let Robb go, swearing that they will take no revenge, he looks at her in mistrust and says "Only a fool would believe such blather. D'you take me for a fool, my lady?".
*After killing Jinglebell, Catelyn is driven to insanity. She scratches her face, her blood mingled with tears, until the Freys disarm and kill her.
*Catelyn is killed by Raymund Frey, not by [[Walder Rivers]].
*Daenerys does not conquer Yunkai via a back gate. Her army destroys Yunkai's troops without actually invading the city, then Yunkai surrenders.
*Wendel Manderly is shown at the wedding, but not formally introduced. He can be identified at the wedding by the merman on his clothing.
*Roose does not kill Robb with a dagger, but stabs him in the heart with a longsword. 

==="[[Mhysa]]"===
*Tyrion and Sansa do not get along even remotely well in the books. Every moment they spend together is tense and awkward. Sansa's misery deepens every day, and anything Tyrion does could not cheer her up. The conversation between them does not occur in the books.
*Tyrion has never been called "demon monkey".
*There is no mention in the books that Arya ever put sheep dung in Sansa's bed.
*There are no characters named [[Desmond Crakehall]] and [[Eldrick Sarsfield]] in the books.
*When Joffrey says he will show Sansa Robb's severed head, it is not Varys but [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] who reminds him that Sansa is his aunt by marriage.
*Tywin expects that, with the tide of the war now firmly against them, most of the rebel Riverlands lords will [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]], and he plans to offer generous terms to those who surrender. Joffrey, however, wants them all executed. Tywin dismisses this as folly, pointing out that a lord who rebels should be crushed, but if he bends the knee, he should be granted mercy, or else no one will ever surrender to you again.
*After the Small Council meeting, once everyone else has left, Tywin and Tyrion discuss the murder of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]'s [[Elia Martell|wife]] [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|and]] [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|children]] by [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] and [[Amory Lorch]] as [[Oberyn Martell]] has already arrived at King's Landing seeking justice. Tywin reveals his intention to tell Oberyn that Amory, who has since been killed, was responsible for all three deaths, not just Rhaenys. Though Tywin admits that killing the Targaryen children was necessary to demonstrate the Lannisters' loyalty as they came late to Robert Baratheon's cause, he concedes that it was overly cruel and not necessary to kill Elia too. Tywin says he had not even considered Elia beforehand, and thinks that Clegane killed her because he had not been ordered to spare her. When Tyrion questions the oversight on his father's part, Tywin defends himself that at the time he was more concerned about [[Eddard Stark]], who was leading Robert's army south after [[Battle of the Trident|the Trident]] might either beat him to King's Landing or attack Tywin's army in the belief they supported the Mad King, that Jaime might do something stupid, or Aerys, facing certain defeat, might kill Jaime for no more reason than to spite Tywin
*After Joffrey leaves, Cersei mentions the time he cut open a pregnant cat, and Robert beat him severely, breaking two of his baby teeth. Tywin (who is irate at Joffrey's insults) merely replies that had Robert been allowed to beat the boy more often, it might have solved a great many problems.
*It is made more explicit in the novels that Tywin's patience with his insolent grandson is wearing thin. Tyrion notices that Tywin is enraged by Joffrey's accusation of cowardice during [[Robert's Rebellion]], and trying not to show it. Tywin reminds Cersei that she reassured him Joffrey was nothing like Robert, as he did not fight a war to put Robert the Second on the throne. Once she is gone, Tyrion says that Joffrey is not Robert the Second, but [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]] the Third. Tywin decides that Joffrey requires a "sharp lesson", which reminds Tyrion of the sharp lesson he received from his father after marrying [[Tysha]]. 
*Tywin never mentions having wanted to kill Tyrion as a baby.
*The scene where Arya and the Hound encounter the Freys is different in the novel. Firstly, Arya and the Hound are attacked when the fighting breaks out in the Stark/Tully camp outside the Twins. Sandor kills both of the Freys and then knocks out Arya to save her from running toward Catelyn and Robb and thus to her doom. In the novel, Arya did not attack the Freys or offer them money, as Sandor finished them off quickly.
*Tyrion tells Sansa about the death of her mother and brother.
*Varys never offers Shae a chance at a new life across the narrow sea. In the book, she never exhibits any feelings of loyalty toward Sansa.
*When Arya attacks the Frey man-at-arms after he boasts about stitching Grey Wind's head to Robb's body, she drops the coin that [[Jaqen H'ghar]] gave her to distract him and give her an opportunity to strike. In ''A Clash of Kings'', she does this to a different person, a Bolton guard at the Gate of Harrenhal, to facilitate her, Hot Pie and Gendry's escape. The multiple stabbing of the soldier by Arya portrays the way she kills another character later in the book.
*Both Davos and Stannis doubt that the leech ritual had anything to do with Robb's death.
*Davos does not just remind Stannis that Edric is his nephew, but explicitly states that a kinslayer is cursed in the eyes of gods and men.
*Stannis is not willing to sacrifice his nephew, but only after he receives news that all the three "usurpers" are dead.
*Gendry was never brought to Dragonstone. In the book, another of Robert's bastards, Edric Storm, is in Stannis's castle for safekeeping. However, Davos did help Edric to escape to the [[Free Cities]] on board of [[Salladhor Saan]]'s ship, alongside a group of trustworthy people who did not believe in the Lord of Light. Edric had no idea that his life was in danger, and Davos did not tell him that.
*Melisandre does not burn the letter which Davos shows Stannis.
*Stannis does not tell the guards to take Davos away. He draws Lightbringer and intends to kill Davos on the spot, unless Davos can give good reason to spare his life.
*Melisandre does not convince Stannis to spare Davos, on the contrary: she tells Davos that what he did was wrong. It is Stannis himself who decides to pardon Davos.
*The reason for sparing Davos is not Melisandre stating that they need him, but Stannis realizing Davos reminded him of his true duties as King: protecting the realm.
*The scene between Roose Bolton and Walder Frey does not occur in the novels.
*It is not Walder Frey but his son Emmon who is granted the title of Lord of Riverrun.
*Ramsay did not flay any of the ironborn who were killed during the sack of Winterfell. 
*While it is heavily implied twice in the book ''A Dance with Dragons'' that Theon had lost his manhood. The Boy, now revealed to be Roose Bolton's bastard son Ramsay, did not send his penis in a box to Balon Greyjoy at Pyke. He sent a piece of skin from Theon's little finger to Roose, and Roose showed that to Robb and Catelyn before the Red Wedding - the only time in the entire book ''A Storm of Swords'' that Theon's status is reported.
*In the books, the nickname "Reek" was assumed by three people successively: Ramsay's former servant whose real name may be "Heke"; Ramsay himself (he exchanges identities with Heke the "Reek" when his life is threatened); and Theon. The TV series only depicts the use of this nickname on Theon.
*Ramsay never sends any messages to Balon. He sends a warning message to Asha/Yara, to which he encloses a piece of Theon's skin (instead of a full body part) without specifying his status, but it happens much later.
*Asha/Yara believes that Theon is dead. She never attempts to rescue him, even after she realizes (from a letter Ramsay has sent her) he is alive and held prisoner by the Boltons.
*The scene with Balon and Asha/Yara does not occur in the books. At this point, Asha/Yara is present holding Deepwood Motte and Victarion holds Moat Cailin, as the ironborn continue their campaign in the north. Many of the ironborn believe Theon died at the Sack of Winterfell, as Yara/Asha later lamented that many of the bodies in Winterfell were unrecognizable (being mutilated by scavengers) when she arrived, so Ramsay never sent a letter to Pyke letting the Greyjoys know they held Theon captive. She thus does not prepare to attack the Dreadfort in the novel.
*Shae does not love Tyrion in the books and Tyrion is well aware of this. He chides himself for not breaking up with her.
*On the way to King's Landing, a knight named Bertram Beesbury meets Jaime and Brienne, and tells them about the Red Wedding. Brienne is emotionally devastated to hear about the demise of the Starks. Jaime feels sorry for her, although the Starks were the enemies of his house, and tries unsuccessfully to console her. In the series, Brienne does not learn of the Red Wedding on-screen.
*Jaime, Brienne, Qyburn and their escorts do not arrive at King's Landing until after [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's wedding]]. They arrive on horseback and are welcomed at the gate of the Red Keep by three of the Kingsguard and a dozen Gold Cloaks, rather than entering side gate on foot and unnoticed.
* Loras confronts Brienne, accusing her of [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|Renly's death]] and challenges her to fight. Brienne tells Loras it was [[Shadow|a shadow]] that killed Renly, but he does not believe her. Jaime intervenes and stops Loras, though he does order Brienne confined to a tower cell for both her own protection and to appease Loras. Later, Jaime talks with Loras and makes him realize Brienne is innocent.
*Neither Ygritte nor any of the other wildlings catch up with Jon on his way back to Castle Black. Jon fully escaped the wildlings after the incident in Queenscrown when Bran warged into Summer to allow Jon an opportunity to escape. He is shot in the leg by one arrow, not three, which he believes may belong to Ygritte.
*Jon never tells Ygritte that he loves her. It is in his thoughts where he says he loved Ygritte.
*Sam does not show the dragonglass weapons to Bran. He had only one dragonglass dagger (which he took from Mormont's body), and that dagger shattered when he fought the wight that attacked him and Gilly.
*The Black Gate, which secures the entrance to the secret passage across the Wall, seems to be omitted in the TV series. Located at the bottom of the well from which Sam and Gilly emerge, it is a door made of weirwood with a face on it. It needs a sworn brother from Night's Watch (Sam in this case) to recite the Night's Watch oath to open the gate.
*Bran does not tell his companions about the [[Rat Cook]]; he only recalls that Old Nan told him the story in mind.
*It is not Bran but Jojen who denies his identity when Sam recognizes him.
*Before departing, Bran makes Sam swear three times that he will say nothing about meeting him, not even to Jon.
*The mysterious person known as "Coldhands", who took Sam and Gilly to the Nightfort, joins Bran's group, and they continue north.
*Sam and Gilly are not at Castle Black when Jon first arrives. They arrive much later.
*Gilly does not name her baby, following the wildling custom not to name babies before they are two years old.
*The brothers who remained at Castle Black sent distress messages to all the five kings and many lords long before Sam returns with Gilly. One of those messages reached Dragonstone, but Alester Florent (the former Stannis' Hand) did not show it to Stannis. Only by chance, Maester Pylos gave this letter to Davos while he taught him to read.
*Arya and Sandor were not in the Twins long enough to see Robb with Grey Wind's head stitched on. In the novel, Robb's iron crown was nailed onto Grey Wind's head, but it happened off-screen.
*When Daenerys greeted the liberated slaves of Yunkai, she trotted through the crowd on her silver horse, who at that point in the show already died in the Red Waste.
*The conversation between Tyrion and Cersei does not occur in the novels.
*Tywin's plan to marry Cersei to Willas Tyrell (in the series - Loras) is rejected by the Tyrells, unlike in the series. Olenna Tyrell forced her son Mace to reject the proposal on the grounds that Cersei is too old and too "used" for her precious grandson. It may also have been payback for foiling the Tyrells' plan to marry Sansa to Willas. Tywin decides not to mention it anymore.
