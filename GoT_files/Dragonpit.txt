The '''Dragonpit'''{{Ref|GOT701}}{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Zaldrījudiri''}} is a huge structure in [[King's Landing]] that [[House Targaryen]] once used as a giant stable for their [[dragon]]s. It was built following [[Maegor Targaryen]]'s destruction of the [[Sept of Remembrance]]. It was later destroyed and never rebuilt.

==History==
===Background===
The top of Rhaenys's Hill was once home to the Sept of Remembrance. It was destroyed by Maegor the Cruel in the [[Faith Militant uprising]] and then replaced with the Dragonpit.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Dragonpit is a huge, cavernous building that sits atop the Hill of Rhaenys in King's Landing. It is located on the opposite side of the city from Visenya's Hill, atop which stands the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. [[Flea Bottom]] is located on the south side of the hill (at the bottom), and the Street of Silk (the red light district where [[Littlefinger's brothel|Chataya's brothel]] is located) is on the northern side.

During the early years of the city, a great Sept was built on Rhaenys's Hill known as the [[Sept of Remembrance]] which used to be the main Sept in King's Landing. During the [[Faith Militant uprising]], about forty years after the Targaryen Conquest, [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]] mounted on [[Balerion|Balerion the Black Dread]] [[Burning of the Sept of Remembrance|incinerated the Great Sept]] with dragonflame. Afterwards, Maegor decreed that a large domed structure would be built on the hill as a "stable for dragons". Maegor had just finished construction on the [[Red Keep]], after which he had all of the builders killed to preserve the secrets of the hidden passages within it. Understandably, few stonemasons and laborers volunteered to build the Dragonpit: instead, prisoners from the city's dungeons were press-ganged into construction labor. They were supervised by architects from [[Myr]] and [[Volantis]].

The Dragonpit was incomplete when Maegor died under mysterious circumstances but its construction was taken up by his successor. During King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]]'s minority, the rule of the realm was managed by his mother, Queen Regent Alyssa Velaryon, and her second husband Rogar Baratheon, [[Lord of Storm's End]] and [[Hand of the King]]. Completing work on the Dragonpit was one of Lord Baratheon's ambitions before he handed the rule of the Seven Kingdoms over to Jaehaerys. However, Maegor's wars had emptied the Crown's treasury and construction on the Dragonpit ground to a halt due to a lack of coin. When Jaehaerys took the realm into his own hands upon his majority, one of his first priorities was restoring the Iron Throne's finances, a task he accomplished thanks to his efficient Master of Coin, the Pentoshi Rego Draz. Draz's taxes on the luxury items desired by the lords and merchants of Westeros and his ability to gain favorable loans from the Iron Bank of Braavos and its rivals in other Free Cities allowed Jaehaerys to continue work on the Dragonpit, a construction that would eventually be completed and celebrated with the first great tourney of the King's reign since the marriage of his mother to Lord Rogar Baratheon. After the Dragonpit's completion, Balerion became the first dragon to be housed in the new edifice, soon joined by other dragons such as the King's [[Vermithor]] and Good Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]]'s [[Silverwing]]. To protect the dragons from thieves looking for dragon eggs, would-be dragon slayers, or overeager young Targaryen princes and princesses, King Jaehaerys ordered the creation of a new order of guards to protect the Dragonpit: the Dragonkeepers, seventy-seven guards charged with protecting both the dragons of the pit and the yards of Dragonstone.

Despite its simplistic name - "dragon pit" - it was actually a gigantic colosseum-like mega-structure. Thirty knights could ride abreast into its entrance. Forty large undervaults were carved deep under the hill, intended for one dragon to nest in each, though there were never that many Targaryen dragons at once. There were only 20 during the Dance, and many fewer during Maegor's time. Apparently, he had the foresight to anticipate the number of dragons to grow in the future. Inside of the dome, the walls were lined with stone benches which could comfortably seat 80,000 people so it was used for public spectacles such as the funeral ceremony for King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]]. When living dragons still nested beneath the dome, light would shine through the windows at night. Subsequent generations of dragons grew smaller. Some said it was because they were contained in the Dragonpit, though others scoff that by the same logic men who live in small houses should grow smaller. Many dragons continued to nest in the sides of the Dragonmont volcano on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] island. Dragons could be stabled in the Dragonpit, but nests for their eggs needed the heat of the volcano.

During the [[Great Spring Sickness]] so many people died so quickly that there was no time to bury the bodies. Instead they were piled up in the Dragonpit and when the corpses were 10 feet deep, the [[Hand of the King]], Lord [[Brynden Rivers]], ordered the [[Alchemists' Guild|pyromancers]] to incinerate them. The fires burned night and day, the dark green glow of [[wildfire]] visible through the windows at night through all of King's Landing.

By the time the [[War of the Five Kings]] breaks out, the Dragonpit is still an abandoned ruin, though it is now frequented by [[Prostitution|whores]] (apparently spillover from the nearby Street of Silk - the cheaper kind of street-walker whores who can't get work in a dedicated brothel building). In the second novel, one of these whores and her patron fall through the floor and stumble onto one of the hidden [[wildfire]] stashes that the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] had hidden throughout the city during [[Robert's Rebellion]] - part of the [[Wildfire plot]] to have the pyromancers destroy the entire city rather than let it fall to the rebels. This recovered stockpile enabled Tyrion to use it against Stannis's fleet at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] since the pyromancers could never have made the massive quantities of wildfire needed on such short notice. The TV show omitted this extra detail and just said that the alchemists worked day and night to produce that much wildfire.

During his [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat for Joffrey's murder]], when he sees the crowds that have come to watch, Tyrion thinks to himself that the Crown should have held the event in the Dragonpit and charged for admission, joking that the funds raised would have paid for [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s [[Purple Wedding|wedding]] and funeral.{{Bookref|ASOS|70}}
