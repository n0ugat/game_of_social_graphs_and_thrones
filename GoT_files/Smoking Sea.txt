{{Quote|East of Westeros lies the Smoking Sea, where no ship dares sail. There are those who swear it to be demon-haunted. And who's to say they're wrong?|[[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]]|Valyria & the Dragons}}
The '''Smoking Sea'''{{Ref|H&L108}}{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Ōrbro Embar''}} is a body of water located immediately to the south of the [[Valyrian peninsula]], on the south coast of [[Essos]]. It is part of the ocean known as the [[Summer Sea]]. Formed by the [[Doom of Valyria]], the Smoking Sea separates the numerous islands that were formerly part of [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]] from one another and the mainland to the north.

After kidnapping [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] in [[Volantis]], [[Jorah Mormont]] steals a fishing boat and heads east to [[Meereen]] in [[Slaver's Bay]] to present him as a gift to [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]. Jorah takes the boat through the Smoking Sea as a shortcut, and as he explains to Tyrion, because even pirates are afraid to approach the waters around Valyria, they won't get any trouble from them on that route. Along the way, they are attacked by [[Stone Men|stone men]] exiled among the ruins;<ref>"[[Kill the Boy]]"</ref> one of them touches Jorah on the left wrist and infects him with [[Greyscale]].

==In the books==
[[Image:Smoking Sea and Ruins of Valyria.png|thumb|200px|The Smoking Sea and the ruins of Old Valyria.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels the Smoking Sea is ill-omened. Its waters are said to bubble and let off foul vapors and mists which can kill sailors outright. The Smoking Sea is a recent phenomenon, formed four hundred years ago during the [[Doom of Valyria]] when the peninsula was shattered by a massive series of [[Fourteen Flames|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes.

The Smoking Sea is considered cursed and haunted. Most sailors refuse to sail its waters, instead circumnavigating Valyria by taking a wide detour out to sea.
