'''''The Seven-Pointed Star'''''{{Ref|GOT402}} is the holy text of the [[Faith of the Seven]].

Its title is a reference to the seven-pointed star used as a symbol of the Faith, which signifies the seven-in-one godhead. Just as the seven points are all part of the same star, the [[Seven]] are not actually seven separate gods, but a single deity that manifests to mankind through seven different aspects or facets.

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
At the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon|Luke Velaryon]] swear on ''The Seven-Pointed Star'' that they will act as peaceful messengers rather than warriors.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]] mentions to [[Melisandre]] that she has read ''The Seven-Pointed Star''. Melisandre, as a devout priestess in the religion of the [[Lord of Light]], scoffs that it is filled with lies.{{Ref|GOT402}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
When [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] and [[Margaery Tyrell]] are imprisoned by the [[Faith Militant]], their grandmother [[Olenna Tyrell|Olenna]] comes to the [[Great Sept of Baelor]] to demand that the so-called [[High Sparrow]] (the new [[High Septon]]) release them. He bluntly tells her that he serves the gods, and the gods demand justice. Olenna sarcastically asks how the gods communicate their will to him, by [[horse]] or messenger-[[raven]], but the High Sparrow simply responds that it is through their holy text, ''The Seven-Pointed Star'', and reminds her of the sections of the text prohibiting "buggery and perjury".{{Ref|GOT507}}

==Excerpts==
''Do not presume to know the damned. The foulest murderer may repent and seek the [[Mother]]'s mercy before the end. The honest septon may pray every night and still be found wanting.''

''The [[Seven hells|Seven Hells]] brim with the souls of saintly men. They scream in agony and their shame is so great. They do not feel the flames, for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved.''

''The King is father to the realm, but he is not the [[Father]]. The King speaks with the voice of the King. The [[High Septon]] speaks with the voice of the [[Seven|Gods]]. When the Gods speak, the King must listen. What the Gods demand, the King must provide. How the Gods judge, the King must submit.''

''When necessary, the High Septon may convene a Holy Court to try crimes against the faith, and dispense the Father's justice. As long as he sits in the Father's seat, the High Septon's word is mandate, for the faith and all the faithfull [...]''

==In the books==

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, ''The Seven-Pointed Star'' is the holy text of the Faith of the Seven. Much like the Christian Bible, it is divided into several internal sections or "books", based on different aspects of the Faith. The only specific internal subdivision mentioned so far is the "Maiden's Book", also called the "Book of the Maiden" ("the [[Maiden]]" being one of the Seven). Presumably there are a total of seven of these gospel-like sections, one for each aspect of the godhead.

Among other contents, notable sections include narratives about how the Seven first appeared to the [[Andals]] and their king, [[Hugor of the Hill]], thousands of years ago when they were still living in the hills of [[Andalos]] on the other side of the [[Narrow Sea]].{{Bookref|ADWD|5}}
