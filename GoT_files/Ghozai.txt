==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novel series, Ghozai was destroyed during the [[Doom of Valyria]], when a tsunami 300 feet high descended on the Isle of Cedars, drowning hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants. Its broken pyramids are infested with monkeys. In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Victarion Greyjoy orders the Iron Fleet to chase the trading galley ''Ghiscari Dawn'', which tries to escape by sailing close to Ghozai. Both the ''Lamentation'' and ''Ghiscari Dawn'' get so close to the ruins that they can hear monkeys chattering.
