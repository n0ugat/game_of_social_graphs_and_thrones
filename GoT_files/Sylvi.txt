'''Sylvi'''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }} is a brothel madam who resides in [[King's Landing]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Sylvi runs a high-end [[Prostitution|brothel]] on the [[Street of Silk]] that caters to nobles and the well-to-do. Her establishment has also been known to receive royal customers such as Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] and Prince [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[Criston Cole]] and Aemond visit Sylvi for information regarding Aegon's whereabouts. She tells them that the prince no longer comes to the Street of Silk, and that his tastes are known to be "less discriminating." As the pair leaves, Sylvi remarks at how much Aemond has grown since she last saw him.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:2x6 Dyana Sylvi and Ulf Still.jpg|thumb|Sylvi at the Cock Inn.]]
Aemond spends time leisurely with Sylvi at her brothel, telling her that he was the target of the [[Blood and Cheese|assassins]] Daemon sent, and that he feels remorse for [[Fight above Shipbreaker Bay|Luke's death]]. Sylvi tells him that when princes lose their temper, smallfolk like her often suffer.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

==Behind the scenes==
Michelle Bennard is a veteran actress and well-known acting coach. In the behind-the-scenes video for her first appearance in Season 1's "[[The Green Council]]," [[Fabien Frankel]] ([[Criston Cole]]) noted that it was odd sharing a scene with her because she actually used to be one of his own drama school teachers.

Sylvi's character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"The proprietor of an upscale brothel."''<ref name="WBD" />

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no direct equivalent to the scenes in "The Green Council" of Aemond and Criston searching for Aegon through the brothels of King's Landing, and it's never mentioned that Aegon took Aemond to a brothel when he turned thirteen.

Sylvi might, however, be loosely based on the book character Sylvenna Sand, a Dornish prostitute at the high-end brothel known as the House of Kisses which Aegon was known to have visited.
