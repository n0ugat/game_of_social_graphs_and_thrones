In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Leng is an island realm ruled by god-empresses. It is an island of forests and jungles, rich in spices and gemstones, and said to be home to "ten thousand tigers and ten million monkeys." The culture on the south of the island is indigenous to Leng, while the people on the northern half of the island are descended from [[Yi Ti]]. In the depth of the island, there are strange ruined cities with massive, fallen buildings.
