A '''Frey guard''' is a guard in service to [[House Frey]].

==Biography==
===Background===
He is a soldier sworn to [[House Frey]].{{Ref|GOT309}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The Frey guard turns [[Sandor Clegane]] and [[Arya Stark]] away from the [[Twins]] when they attempt to enter under the guise of a [[hog farmer]] and his daughter, as the surrounding soldiers prepare for the [[Red Wedding]] massacre. After Sandor voices doubt in the feast being over, the guard asks if he is soft in the head and tells him to turn the cart around. By doing this, the guard actually saves Sandor's life by stopping him entering what is to become the Red Wedding.{{Ref|GOT309}}
