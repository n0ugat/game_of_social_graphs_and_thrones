{{Quote|A prince is riding. I've heard the thunder of his hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him... and their wives will weep tears of blood... the stallion who mounts the world.|Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] translates the words of one of the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]''|A Golden Crown}}
The '''stallion who mounts the world''',{{Ref|GOT106}}{{Note|[[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]]: ''Vezh fin saja rhaesheseres''}} also known as the '''stallion who will mount the world'''{{Ref|GOT107}} or the '''stallion that will mount the world''',{{Ref|GOT108}} is a prophecy in the [[Great Stallion|Dothraki religion]]. According to the prophecy, the Stallion is the "''[[khal]]'' of ''khals''" who will unite all the Dothraki under his single ''[[khalasar]]'' and ride to the ends of the earth. The prophecy states that "he will be the khal of khals, and all the people of the world will be his herd."

[[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s unborn son, [[Rhaego]], was announced by the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]'' to be the prophesied figure.{{Ref|GOT106}} However, her son was killed in the womb before any part of the prophecy could be fulfilled. The [[Lhazareen]] ''[[maegi]]'' [[Mirri Maz Duur]] believed that Rhaego would bring about unbridled death and suffering, much as Rhaego's father had visited upon her village, so she tricked Daenerys into sacrificing his life for the life of her husband, Khal [[Drogo]].{{Ref|GOT110}}
