'''Willem of the Dun Fort''' was a [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Willem was elected Lord Commander after [[Robert of Oxbridge]] was stripped of his command and imprisoned. His decision to appoint Ser [[Jon Baxter]] as [[First Ranger]] was a subject of controversy, as Baxter was considered incompetent due to his heavy drinking. Willem would not relent, however, and threatened to condemn the protesters to share Robert's ice cell. This settled the matter, and Willem continued to serve as Lord Commander for twenty years with Jon as his First Ranger.<ref>[[:File:5x2 Night's Watch Book.jpg]]</ref>
