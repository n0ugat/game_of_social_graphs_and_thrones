{{Quote|We were so few though that all we could do was harry the Lannisters' rear. Luckily, all they could do was kill Beric.

Ser '''Burton Crakehall'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Crakehall]].

==Biography==
During the [[War of the Five Kings]], Ser Burton fought and killed [[Beric Dondarrion]], leader of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], crushing his helm and skull with a mace. However, [[Thoros]] eventually revived Beric.{{Ref|H&L611}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Burton Crakehall is the brother of Lord [[Roland Crakehall]].

Ser Burton pursues and kills Beric (this is Beric's second death), only for the latter to be resurrected. Later, Beric leads an ambush and slays Burton and his column of soldiers.
