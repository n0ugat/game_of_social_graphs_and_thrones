The '''Sword of the Morning'''{{Ref|GOT401}} is a title bestowed upon the [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Dayne]] that bears [[Dawn]], the ancestral longsword of the family.

==Known Swords of the Morning==
*Ser {[[Davos Dayne]]}, the son of the defeated King [[Vorian Dayne]].
*Ser {[[Arthur Dayne]]}, a knight of [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]]'s [[Kingsguard]]. Slain at the [[Tower of Joy]] in a duel against [[Eddard Stark]] and [[Howland Reed]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the title of "Sword of Morning" can be bestowed upon a member of House Dayne, who will afterwards wield their family's ancestral sword, Dawn, an incredible blade forged from the metal in a "fallen star". Dawn is not [[Valyrian steel]], although it has very similar properties concerning strength, sharpness, and light weight. Unlike Valyrian steel, Dawn's metal is pale as milk glass.

The title is ''not'' hereditary. Rather, Dawn is only held by a member of House Dayne who is considered worthy of the honor after displaying immense skill at swordsmanship. Sometimes the head of House Dayne wields Dawn, but in some generations of the family it is held by a younger brother or cousin. In some generations, no member of the family is allowed to wield the sword at all because it is deemed that none have proven themselves worthy. When a current "Sword of the Morning" dies, he does not pass Dawn down to his own children; instead, it is brought back to [[Starfall]] to wait for a new Sword of the Morning to rise again, which may take generations.

According to George R.R. Martin, the sword Dawn remains at Starfall during the [[War of the Five Kings]] as no new Sword of the Morning has yet risen since the death of Arthur Dayne.
