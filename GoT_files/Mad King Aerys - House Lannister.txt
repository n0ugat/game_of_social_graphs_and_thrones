==Premise==
{{Premise|H&L113}}

==Narration==
'''Tywin Lannister''': ''As Aerys Targaryen's behavior grew more and more erratic, the task of ruling the [[Seven Kingdoms]] fell to me, [[Tywin Lannister]].''

''I had served Aerys for nearly twenty years and as a result, the realm had prospered. The royal coffers were full, the land was at peace.''

''But Aerys grew increasingly hostile, jealous of the success many credited to me. My power and influence unnerved him.''

''The [[Captain of the guard|captain]] of my personal guard, Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], was once overheard making offhand comments regarding who was the true ruler of [[Westeros]]. When the king was given this information, he had llyn Payne's tongue ripped out with hot pincers.''

''It was my desire to unite the Houses of [[House Lannister|Lannister]] and [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] through marriage. My daughter, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], would marry Aerys's eldest son, Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]. Such a union made perfect sense for all parties. However, Aerys's senses had begun to leave him quite sometime earlier.''

''Instead of uniting the royal family with its most loyal and powerful ally, Aerys chose instead to insult my family, indicating that such a match was beneath Rhaegar. Instead, he chose [[Elia Martell]] of Dorne to be Rhaegar's wife.''

''As if to rub salt in my wounds, Aerys appointed [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], my son, to the [[Kingsguard]].''

''The Kingsguard may be an honor for lesser families than ours, but it is a lifetime appointment that forces him to renounce all family holdings. This creates a difficulty in naming an heir to [[Casterly Rock]]. But Aerys knew all that.''

''I had grown tired of the king's constant provocation. Thus I resigned my post as Aerys's [[Hand of the King|Hand]] and returned to [[Casterly Rock]] with my considerable forces.''

''When [[Robert Baratheon]] rebelled against the throne, Aerys grew fearful that I would join with Robert's forces and rise against him. He thought himself clever and kept Jaime very close as if warning me.''

''He sunk deeper and deeper into delusion, paranoia, and violence.''

''I've heard it said he became obsessed with [[wildfire]], a substance which, once lit, cannot be extinguished. Convinced he had enemies all around him, he wouldn't allow blades in his presence, save for those of his Kingsguard.''

''Alas, that proved to be his undoing.''
