{{Dialogue a-b|Kesh|When does she return?|Tyrion Lannister|Soon. You have my word.|Kesh and Tyrion|Book of the Stranger}}
'''Kesh''' is a former slave and a prominent leader among the freedmen of [[Meereen]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
After [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] has met with a delegation of the Masters from [[Astapor]], [[Yunkai]], and [[Volantis]], he meets a group of freedmen from Meereen, including Kesh, who are unhappy with Tyrion negotiating for peace with the people who caused so much suffering for them. Kesh asks Tyrion when [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] will return to Meereen, and Tyrion assures him that she will come back soon. However, the men do not trust Tyrion as he is a stranger to the court. Kesh turns to [[Missandei]] instead, asking her whether she trusts the Masters, and she reluctantly confirms that they need to make peace.{{Ref|GOT604}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character by the name of Kesh. Prominent freedmen include Mollono Yos Dob and Symon Stripeback, both of whom lead companies of freedmen fiercely loyal to Daenerys.
