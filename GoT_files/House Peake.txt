==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
House Peake declares for the [[Greens]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].<ref name="Intro">[[:File:Season 2 Opening Credits - House of The Dragon - Season 2 - HBO|Season 2 Opening Credits | House of The Dragon | Season 2 | HBO]]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the seat of House Peake is Starpike. Additionally, they used to own the castles [[Dunstonbury]] and [[Whitegrove]]. The current Lord of Starpike is Titus Peake.

House Peake was founded during the [[Age of Heroes]], by a husband of Florys the Fox, a daughter of [[Garth Greenhand]]. Under the reign of [[House Gardener]], the Peakes and the [[House Manderly|Manderlys]] were bitter rivals. This eventually ended in Lord Lorimar Peake, by King Perceon III's command, driving the Manderlys out of the Reach and taking their castle Dunstonbury. Lord Peake's daughter then married the king's son and eventual successor Gwayne. This was not the only union between Gardener and Peake; Lorimar's daughter had been the seventh Peake to become queen of the Reach. They also joined with Houses Costayne, [[House Florent|Florent]], [[House Hightower|Hightower]], Oakheart, [[House Osgrey|Osgrey]], [[House Redwyne|Redwyne]], and [[House Rowan|Rowan]].

Lord Armen Peake and his sons were killed on the [[Field of Fire]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]]. With the Gardeners extinct and the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]] the new liege lords of the Reach, the Peakes lost a considerable amount of power, having no connections with the new ruling family.

At the [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council of 101 AC]], Lord Peake was among the lords who voted for [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys Targaryen]].

Lord Gormon Peake was among the foremost supporters of [[Daemon Blackfyre]]. After the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], he lost Dunstonbury and Whitegrove.

At the end of the third century, Titus Peake is married to Margot Lannister. There are also three exiled Peakes serving in the [[Golden Company]]. Ser Laswell Peake is one of [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]]'s generals.

House Peake is an homage to the English writer {{WPS|Mervyn Peake}}, and several members of the house are named after characters from his works. The character Mervyn Flowers is named after Mervyn Peake himself, and Gormon Peake is named after his famous fantasy series ''Gormenghast''.
