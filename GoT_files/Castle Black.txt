'''Castle Black'''{{Ref|GOT102}} is the primary headquarters and redoubt of the [[Night's Watch]]. It is located roughly halfway along the length of the [[Wall]] on its southern side, at the northern end of the [[Kingsroad]]. It is a dark and chilling home to its garrison.

Castle Black was, initially, one of only three manned castles left on the Wall along with [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] and the [[Shadow Tower]]. There are nineteen castles along the Wall, but as their numbers fell over the centuries, the Night's Watch abandoned sixteen of them. Castle Black is located between the unmanned castles of [[Queensgate]] and Oakenshield.

Castle Black has a sept, but no [[godswood]]. Those who are followers of the [[Old Gods]] must travel a mile [[Beyond the Wall|north]] of the Wall, into the [[Haunted Forest]] to take their vows before a [[heart tree]].

After learning of the [[breaching of the Wall]], [[Jon Snow]] orders the remaining castles on the Wall be abandoned and for their garrisons to come to [[Winterfell]].
