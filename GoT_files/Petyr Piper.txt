{{Quote|I have seen my fair share of their quarrels, and I tell you there is no honor in a fight such as this.|Petyr on the Blackwood raids against House Bracken|Regent (episode)}}
Lord '''Petyr Piper'''{{Con|F&B}}{{Note|Only identified by surname in closed captions.}} is the Lord of [[Pinkmaiden]] and head of [[House Piper]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Petyr Piper and three other riverlords arrive at [[Harrenhal]] to complain to [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] about the [[Raids on Bracken lands|atrocities]] performed by the [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]] at the [[House Bracken|Brackens]]' lands. He angrily states there were works of barbarity, and that there is no honor in such fighting.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

At a meeting of the riverlords in Harrenhal's godswood, Lord Piper questions why he should respect the word of [[Oscar Tully]], a boy younger than his own sons. Oscar proves himself a capable leader, however, and Piper follows him in supporting [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s claim to the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|HOTD207}}

As the river lords gather at Harrenhal, Lord Piper informs Daemon that all the sheep in his land have been sold upriver and his vassals have sent pigs for [[Caraxes]] to feed on instead. Daemon says Caraxes prefer pigs over sheep and commands Lord Piper to feed them to his [[Dragons|dragon]].{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Petyr was a grizzled old man by 129 AC. In 105 AC, he was among the lords who swore fealty to [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] as [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]'s heir. The name might be a reference to the nursery rhyme {{WPS|Peter Piper}}.
