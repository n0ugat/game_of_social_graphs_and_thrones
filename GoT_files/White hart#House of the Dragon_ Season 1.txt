The '''white hart'''{{Ref|HOTD103}} is a rare type of deer in [[Westeros]], considered [[magic]]al. They are seen as a symbol of royalty.

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
On Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s second [[nameday]], a grand hunt is organized by King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] in the [[Kingswood]]. Eventually, the [[Royal Huntsman]] Ser [[Howland Sharp]] tracks a white hart, [[Otto Hightower]] naming it the "King of the Kingswood" and proclaiming it a regal portent for Aegon's nameday. This contributes to the king's doubt over naming his daughter [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] his heir, but to his relief the stag they find is not white.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

After a night out and killing a boar in the Kingswood, Rhaenyra and [[Criston Cole]] are approached by the so-called "King of the Kingswood." It stops in a safe distance and looks in Rhaenyra's direction. Ser Criston draws his sword, but Rhaenyra stops him. She and the hart look at each other for a long moment, then it runs off.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, white harts are the subject of songs and legends. In the songs, the gallant [[prince]] most often simply walks up to the white hart, touching it and doing it no harm. According to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]], white harts are very rare and magical.{{Bookref|AGOT|44}}

[[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] hunts a white hart in the [[Kingswood]], taking half of the royal court with him.{{Bookref|AGOT|43}} While they are away, Sansa tells her friend [[Jeyne Poole]] about a dream (actually, a wish) she had: [[Joffrey Baratheon|her prince charming]] shot the hart with a golden arrow and brought it back for her.{{Bookref|AGOT|44}}

Robert's hunting party finds the hart, but it has already been killed and mostly eaten by wolves, leaving the king with nothing but a hoof and a horn. He then sets out to hunt a boar instead, leading to [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|his untimely demise]].{{Bookref|AGOT|45}}

The ''White Hart'' is a war galley in the [[royal fleet]],{{Bookref|ACOK|8}} which gets destroyed by [[wildfire]] during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].{{Bookref|ACOK|58}}

In ''Fire & Blood'', there is no mention of white harts, and the whole hunt subplot does not occur.
