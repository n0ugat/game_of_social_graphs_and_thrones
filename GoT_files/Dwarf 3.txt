A '''dwarf''' makes a living by performing for other peoples' amusement.

==Biography==
===Background===
A [[dwarf]], he makes a living by performing for other peoples' amusement.{{Ref|GOT402}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Along with a group of other dwarfs, he takes part in a mock "reenactment" of the [[War of the Five Kings]] at [[Purple Wedding|King Joffrey's wedding]]. He dresses as [[Renly Baratheon]] and rides a mount resembling [[Loras Tyrell]]. His naked rear end is exposed, a crude reference to Renly's homosexuality. Ser Loras is offended, and storms off.{{Ref|GOT402}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there are only two dwarfs jousting. They ride live animals, a dog and a sow. Their real names are revealed in ''A Dance with Dragons'' - Oppo (aka Groat) and his sister Penny. Neither Renly nor the any member of [[House Tyrell]] is the subject of mockery in the wedding feast.

On the contrary, the song ''Lord Renly's Ride'', by Hamish the Harper, depicts Renly as repenting from attempting to usurp Joffrey and defying the Lord of Death to return to the world of the living to fight for him on the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], and then returning to [[Highgarden]] to look once more at his beloved [[Margaery Tyrell]]. The song was inspired by the account of Renly's ghost fighting along the forces of [[House Tyrell]] and [[House Lannister]] - it was actually [[Garlan Tyrell]] wearing Renly's armor; in the show it was Loras himself.

Hamish the Harper also sings ''A Rose of Gold'' in honor of House Tyrell.
