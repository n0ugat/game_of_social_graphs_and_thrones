The '''unmasking'''{{Ref|H&L504}} was the event in which the hidden city of [[Braavos]] revealed itself to the [[known world]].

==History==
[[Braavos]] was founded by [[Slavery|slaves]] of the [[Valyrian Freehold]] who found shelter in a lagoon behind a wall of pine-clad hills and sea stones, where the frequent fogs would help hide the refugees from the eyes of [[dragon]] riders passing overhead. They built a city in which they vowed that slavery would not be practised, having risked their lives in the name of freedom. This became the first law of Braavos, engraved in a stone arch spanning the [[Long Canal]].

For over a hundred years after this, Braavos hid itself from the world, leading many to call it the "Secret City". The captains of the city would hide their Valyrian [[ships]] by using a dye derived from a local snail to stain the sails purple. Braavos' merchants carried false charts and lied when questioned about their home port. Eventually, the [[Sealord of Braavos]], [[Uthero Zalyne]], decided that enough time had passed for Braavos to reveal itself to the world. The [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] paid the [[dragonlord]]s for the stolen ships, but refused to pay for the value of the slaves themselves.

To this day, the anniversary of the unmasking is celebrated in Braavos with a ten-day festival of feasting and masked revelry. It culminates on the midnight of the tenth day when the [[Titan of Braavos]] roars and tens of thousands of celebrants remove their masks as one.{{Ref|H&L504}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the unmasking is alternately known as the Uncloaking of Uthero. The [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] paid the settlements to the grandchildren of the owners of [[ships]] that [[Braavos]]'s founders stole (making it a point, however, to not pay for the value of the slaves themselves). Ships were then sent forth throughout the world announcing the existence and location of Braavos and inviting men of all nations to the city to celebrate its 111th anniversary.  The Valyrians accepted the money, but ultimately were more consumed with their own internal feuds and weren't really interested in the descendants of long-dead slaves living in an isolated city-state on the far borders of their territories, so they simply ignored Braavos and left it alone.

The Uncloaking of Uthero is apparently inspired by the real-life famous [[Wikipedia:Carnival of Venice|Carnival celebration]] held annually in [[Wikipedia:Venice|Venice]] since the 1100s.  Like other Carnival/Mardi Gras celebrations worldwide it takes place the day before the Christian fasting period of Lent.  Participants in Venice's Carnival celebrations famously wear masks throughout the festivities (so they can party and commit a range of vices free of inhibitions).  Braavos, as a merchant city-state famed for its canals, is heavily inspired by real-life Venice.
