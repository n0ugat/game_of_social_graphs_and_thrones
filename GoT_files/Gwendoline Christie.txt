'''Gwendoline Tracey Philippa Christie''' is an English actress who plays [[Brienne of Tarth]] in ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

==Career==
Born in October 28 1979, Christie grew up in the village of Small Dole within England's South Downs. As an adult, Christie is 6'3" in height (192 cm). She almost reached her full adult height by the time she was only 14 years old, but rejected the growth inhibitors offered by her doctor. She attended Henfield Primary School, then Warden Park Secondary School, and has said her height made it difficult to fit in. With her real life "very quiet, sedate, and bookish", she saw film as an exciting view of a wider world, and eventually moved to London to attend drama school.<ref>[http://www.net-a-porter.com/magazine/273/20 ]</ref>

Christie had several minor roles in films such as ''[[wikipedia:The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus|The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]'', before being cast as Brienne in ''Game of Thrones'', her first major role.

Christie has since been cast in ''[[Wikipedia:The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2|The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2]]'' (alongside fellow ''Game of Thrones'' actress [[Natalie Dormer]]), and on June 2 2014 it was announced that she would appear in ''[[Wikipedia:Star Wars: The Force Awakens|Star Wars Episode VII]]'' (alongside [[Max von Sydow]]).<ref>[http://starwars.com/star-wars-episode-vii-adds-academy-award-winner-lupita-nyongo-and-game-of-thrones-gwendoline-christie.html StarWars.com], June 2, 2014.</ref> Later reports revealed that she would play Captain Phasma, a high-ranking First Order Stormtrooper.<ref>[http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/04/star-wars-gwendoline-christie-revealed-as-captain-phasma]></ref>

==''Game of Thrones''==
On ''Thrones'' she plays the character of [[Brienne of Tarth]], who debuted in [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]]. She was announced in the role by [[George R.R. Martin]] on 8 July 2011. She joined the cast as a guest star in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]].

Christie first heard about the role of Brienne of Tarth when a friend notified her that there was internet speculation that she was going to be cast in an [[HBO]] series (there are only so many 6'3" tall actresses, thus Christie was on the short list of fansite speculation). In fact, Christie had never heard about it before, but this speculation led her to look up fansites and find out what ''Game of Thrones'' was, and about Brienne of Tarth. Christie fell in love with Brienne, read the books and everything about them, and subsequently sought out the role.<ref>[http://www.mtv.co.uk/television/game-of-thrones/video/gwendoline-christie-interview MTV Gwendoline Christie interview.]</ref>

Christie attended the audition in character and wearing armor. According to George R.R. Martin, they decided on casting her quickly, noting: "we looked at a dozen actresses who were reading for Brienne, and one actress who WAS Brienne."<ref>[http://grrm.livejournal.com/227044.html GRRM's blog]</ref> For her role as Brienne, Christie trained extensively to get into the right physical condition, cut off her long hair, and read all of the available novels to study her character's development in detail.<ref>[http://www.sfx.co.uk/2012/04/11/game-of-thrones-gwendoline-christie-interview/ SFX Magazine]</ref> HBO also had Christie take horseriding lessons, and she was trained in swordfighting by C.C. Smith.<ref>[http://www.mtv.co.uk/television/game-of-thrones/video/gwendoline-christie-interview MTV Gwendoline Christie interview.]</ref> She took up kickboxing, kundalini yoga, and running, and drastically changed her diet.<ref>[http://www.net-a-porter.com/magazine/273/20 ]</ref> According to Christie during Season 2, as a result of her extensive training for the role, she gained a stone and a half (about 20 pounds) in pure muscle weight.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKdsu5CaUTA ]</ref>

Writers Benioff and Weiss played a prank on Christie in Season 4: they presented her with a realistic but fake ''New York Times'' article calling her stuck-up and spoiled because she refused to sign a fan's autograph, but neither the fan nor the autograph ever actually existed.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/game-of-thrones/243771/67-things-you-didnt-know-about-game-of-thrones-season-4 ]</ref>

During [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]], Christie said of Brienne overall:

:"Women are all brought up with a series of conventional expectations, so one cannot help but want recognition or affirmation in those areas. I think what’s so beautiful and interesting about the character of Brienne of Tarth is yes, she’s strong; she’s a badass; she has vulnerability. But in all of her lack of convention and her uniqueness, all women can identify with her because she wants to be loved in the way that as human beings – male or female – we all want to be loved. We see the pureness of her humanity, and that she’s something that isn’t so far away from all of us."<ref>[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/gwendoline-christie-knows-brienne-is-a-badass ]</ref>
