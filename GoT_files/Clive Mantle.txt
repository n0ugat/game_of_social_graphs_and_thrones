}}'''Clive Andrew Mantle''' (born 3 June 1957) is a British actor. He was a chorister at St. John's College Choir in Cambridge for four years before joining [[wikipedia:RADA|RADA]]. He won the [[wikipedia:Laurence Olivier Award|Laurence Olivier Award]] for Most Promising Newcomer in 1986 for a stage performance of ''[[wikipedia:Of Mice and Men|Of Mice and Men]]''.

In 1984 he became very well-known to British audiences when he was cast as [[wikipedia:Little John|Little John]] in the cult TV series ''[[wikipedia:Robin of Sherwood|Robin of Sherwood]]'', a fantastical take on the [[wikipedia:Robin Hood|Robin Hood]] legend. He subsequently played the role of surgeon Mike Barrett over nine years, first in ''[[wikipedia:Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' and then its spin-off ''[[wikipedia:Holby City|Holby City]]''. He also had a brief recurring role on the sitcom ''[[wikipedia:The Vicar of Dibley|The Vicar of Dibley]]'' (which also featured [[Sean Bean]]) and a small role in the film ''[[wikipedia:Alien 3|Alien 3]]''.

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' he plays the role of Lord [[Greatjon Umber]] and was confirmed in the role on 20 August 2010.

Mantle was unable to return to the series for [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]] due to having been cast on another TV show. He was not asked to return for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]]. In the [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]] episode "[[Oathbreaker]]", [[Smalljon Umber]] states that his father [[Greatjon Umber]] died so it is unlikely that Mantle will return in later seasons or be recasted.
