'''House Ashford'''{{Ref|GOT504}}{{Note|Lord Ashford's surname is Ashford.}} of [[Ashford]] is a vassal house from the [[Reach]] that holds fealty to Lord [[Bronn]] of [[Highgarden]]. Their seat is [[Ashford]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] presents some paperwork to Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]], consisting of requests to various noble Houses to send new recruits to the [[Night's Watch]]. A few Houses can spare any men during the [[War of the Five Kings]], so the Watch is left scraping the bottom of the barrel: the requests are mostly to minor lords that Jon says he hasn't even heard of, including [[Lord Ashford]].{{Ref|GOT504}}

==Members==
*[[Lord Ashford]], head of the house.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Ashford is never mentioned. It is unknown which side the house took at the [[Battle of Ashford]] and at [[Robert's Rebellion]] in general.
