==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Gawen, along with his mother and sister, are captured when ironborn forces under [[Yara Greyjoy|Asha Greyjoy]] capture Deepwood Motte.

In ''A Feast for Crows'', he and his family are taken by Asha to the [[Ten Towers]] in [[Harlaw]], one of the Iron Islands. Asha ensures that Gawen and his family are well looked after and housed in a tower instead of a dungeon.

In A ''Dance of Dragons'', Gawen and Erena are left captive at Ten Towers in the care of Asha's aunt Gwynesse Harlaw while Sybelle and Asha return to Deepwood Motte, since Asha fears Erena is too unhealthy for a second sea voyage.

According to Sybelle, Gawen has just reached his fourth [[nameday]].
