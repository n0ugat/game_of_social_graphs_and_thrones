==In the books==
In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Hornwood is a loyal vassal of the Starks. House Bolton is said to have designs on their fertile lands.

When [[Robb Stark]] summoned his bannermen, Lord Halys Hornwood and his son Daryn went to [[Winterfell]] and joined his army. Daryn became one of Robb's personal guards. Both of them were killed in the subsequent battles.

Once [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] learned about the death of Halys and Daryn, he kidnapped Lady Donella, raped her, and forced her to marry him and to sign a will naming him the sole heir of the Hornwood lands. Then he locked her in a cell and did not bring her food. When Ser [[Rodrik Cassel]] arrived to save her, it was too late: she starved to death after chewing several of her fingers.

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', following the [[fight by Deepwood Motte]], House Hornwood is one of the northern houses who join [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] in [[Battle in the ice#In the books|his campaign against the Boltons]].{{Bookref|ADWD|35}}
