{{Quote|Baelon the Brave, rider of Vhagar, heir to the Iron Throne... dead of a burst belly. The gods have a dark wit.|Viserys I Targaryen|King of the Narrow Sea (episode)}}
Prince '''Baelon Targaryen''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Baelon Targārien''}} also known as '''Baelon the Brave''', was a son of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys the Conciliator]] and Good Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Baelon was married to his younger sister, [[Alyssa Targaryen]], with whom he had two sons: [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]]. He rode the [[dragon]] [[Vhagar]]. After the death of his older brother [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Aemon]], he was named [[Prince of Dragonstone]] by his father, passing over Aemon's daughter [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

King Jaehaerys organized a grand hunt in the [[Kingswood]] to celebrate Baelon being named [[Hand of the King]]. Five days later, Baelon died of a {{WPS|Appendicitis|burst belly}}.{{Ref|HOTD104}} His death caused a succession crisis that was resolved with the [[Great Council at Harrenhal]], in which Baelon's son Viserys was chosen by the lords of [[Westeros]] as the new Prince of [[Dragonstone]].{{Ref|HOTD101}} He was succeeded as Hand by Ser [[Otto Hightower]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Baelon's death is mentioned. His name is written in the results of the [[Great Council at Harrenhal]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[Ulf]], a commoner of [[King's Landing]], claims to his drinking companions that he is a [[bastard]] son of Baelon, though they do not believe him.{{Ref|HOTD203}} Ulf later admits that he does not actually know if his story is true, but whether it is or not, he successfully claims the [[dragon]] [[Silverwing]] during the [[Red Sowing]].{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Baelon was the fourthborn child of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] and [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]]. He and Alyssa had three sons: Viserys, Daemon, and Aegon, the latter dead in infancy.

Baelon, named after a pre-[[Aegon's Conquest]] Lord of Dragonstone, was born two days after the [[Citadel]] declared spring in 57 AC, earning him the sobriquet "the Spring Prince." He looked up to his older brother Aemon, and followed him wherever he went. The two trained at arms daily. On his first visit to the [[Dragonpit]], he hit [[Balerion]] on the snout with a toy sword, earning him the epithet "Baelon the Brave" from Ser Samgood of Sour Hill.

In 72 AC, Baelon participated in a [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Duskendale]], in which Aemon defeated him. In 73 AC, he fought in another tourney at [[Old Oak]] as a [[mystery knight]], calling himself the "Silver Fool." In the jousting competition, he defeated Lord [[House Rowan|Rowan]], Ser Alyn [[House Ashford|Ashford]], the [[House Fossoway|Fossoway]] twins, and Ser Denys Oakheart, before finally being unhorsed by Ser Rickard [[House Redwyne|Redwyne]]. After unmasking Baelon, Rickard promptly [[Knighthood|knighted]] him. Upon his return to [[King's Landing]], Baelon claimed the [[dragon]] [[Vhagar]].

Baelon trained his younger brother [[Vaegon Targaryen|Vaegon]] at arms for a year at King Jaehaerys's request. It proved fruitless, as Vaegon had neither the talent nor the interest. On their final session of training, Baelon humiliated his brother by making him fight their sister [[Alyssa Targaryen|Alyssa]]. Baelon [[Marriage|married]] Alyssa in 75 AC. Reportedly, the wedding guests were greatly amused by the sounds that came from their bedchamber that night. Viserys was born to them in 77 AC, and then Daemon in 81 AC.

During the Fourth [[Dorne|Dornish]] War in 83 AC, Baelon, Aemon, and their father Jaehaerys mounted their dragons Vhagar, [[Caraxes]], and [[Vermithor]] and burned the Dornish fleet before it landed. They received high praise for having won a war without a single friendly casualty.

In 84 AC, Alyssa gave birth to a third son, Aegon. She died six months later from complications, and Aegon died shortly before his first [[nameday]]. A few years later, Baelon's sister Viserra attempted to seduce him to break her betrothal to Lord Theomore [[House Manderly|Manderly]]. Unresponsive to her advances, Baelon sent her away.

In 92 AC, Prince Aemon was shot dead by a crossbowman during an invasion of [[Tarth]] by [[Myr]]ish exiles. Wroth, Baelon fell upon the Myrmen on Vhagar, and fought them with the [[Valyrian steel]] sword [[Dark Sister]]. Upon his return to King's Landing, Jaehaerys named him [[Prince of Dragonstone]], passing over Aemon's daughter [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] and her unborn child [[Laena Velaryon|Laena]]. In 100 AC, Baelon replaced [[Ryam Redwyne]] as [[Hand of the King]].

In 101 AC, Baelon complained of a stitch in his side during a hunt in the [[Kingswood]]. He was bedridden in the [[Tower of the Hand]] for five days before dying of his condition. After an autopsy, [[Grand Maester]] Runciter attributed the death to a burst belly (appendicitis). His father Jaehaerys personally lit his funeral pyre. He was succeeded as Hand by Ser [[Otto Hightower]].

Baelon's death nearly caused a civil war: reportedly, armies were formed by supporters of Prince Viserys and Princess Rhaenys, [[Corlys Velaryon]] prepared the [[Velaryon navy|Velaryon fleet]] to defend the claim of his son [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]], and Prince Daemon raised a small army of sworn swords and men-at-arms to support his elder brother. The tensions were reduced, but not extinguished, by the subsequent [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council of 101 AC]], in which Baelon's son Viserys was elected Prince of [[Dragonstone]], succeeding Jaehaerys as king two years later.
