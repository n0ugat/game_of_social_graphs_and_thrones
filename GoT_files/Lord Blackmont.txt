Lord Blackmont is greeted by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], outside of [[King's Landing]], when the latter is sent to welcome [[Oberyn Martell]] and his entourage of [[Dorne|Dornish]] lords and knights. The two exchange greetings, in which Lord Blackmont reveals Oberyn has arrived the previous night, before he and the rest of the envoy proceed to the [[Red Keep]].{{Ref|GOT401}}
