{{Quote|Lady Caulfield.|[[Samwell Tarly]] to [[Jon Snow]]|Sons of the Harpy (episode)}}
'''Lady Caulfield''' is the head of [[House Caulfield]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Lady Caulfield sends a message to Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]], in which she agrees to send men to the [[Night's Watch]].{{Ref|GOT504}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of any House Caulfield. The mention of "Lady Caulfield" in the TV show is apparently an in-joke reference to one of the TV show's producers, [[Bernadette Caulfield]].
