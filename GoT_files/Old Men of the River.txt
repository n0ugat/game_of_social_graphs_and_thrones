{{Quote|Legend has it that one day the Valyrians netted and butchered one of the giant turtles the Rhoynar held sacred.|Varys|The River Rhoyne}}
'''Old Men of the River'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} are very large turtles that live in the [[Rhoyne]] River. The largest river system in the known world, the Rhoyne and its network of tributaries flows throughout the territories of the modern-day [[Free Cities]].

The ancient [[Rhoynar]] people considered these turtles sacred.<ref>[[The River Rhoyne]]</ref>

==History==
According to legend, the centuries-long [[Rhoynish Wars]] first began when the [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] colonists in western [[Essos]] netted and butchered one of these giant turtles. This sparked a series of wars which lasted for generations, ultimately resulting in the Rhoynar city-states being destroyed by the might of [[Valyrian Freehold|Valyria]].<ref>[[The River Rhoyne]]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Rhoynar called the giant river turtles by a name which translates as "Old Men of the River". They were considered sacred in the Rhoynar religion, as the consorts of their primary deity Mother Rhoyne (the personified goddess of the river). Another deity in the Rhoynish pantheon, known as the "Old ''Man'' of the River", took the form of one of these giant turtles and was said to be the son of Mother Rhoyne.

The river turtles are described as "enormous", far bigger relative to normal turtles than a [[direwolf]] is relative to a common wolf. Despite their size, encounters with them are very rare. They are possibly few in number and certainly reclusive, as they seem to spend most of their time submerged underwater.

When [[Tyrion Lannister]] travels from [[Pentos]] to [[Volantis]] in the novels, he does so by riverboat down the Rhoyne (Season 5 of the TV series condensed this to just a long journey over land in a large horse-drawn wheelhouse). As they make their way down the Rhoyne past the ruins of the Rhoynar city [[Ny Sar]], one of these giant turtles briefly surfaces near the boat, then disappears again. Tyrion judges that it was as big as the boat he was traveling on, the ''Shy Maid'' - which wasn't just a raft or fishing boat, but a one-mast poleboat large enough to have three internal cabins (though this was still described as a modestly sized boat for long-distance travel). Based on his description it would seem that Old Men of the River can grow to ''at least'' the size of adult [[elephant]]s, possibly much larger.
