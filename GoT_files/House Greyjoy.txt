'''House Greyjoy'''{{Ref|GOT203}} of [[Pyke]] is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. It rules over the [[Iron Islands]], a harsh and bleak collection of islands off the west coast of Westeros, from the castle at [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]]. The head of the house is the [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].

House Greyjoy's sigil is traditionally a golden [[kraken]] on a black field. Their [[house words]] are "We Do Not Sow,"<ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref> although the phrase "What Is Dead May Never Die" is also closely associated with House Greyjoy and their bannermen, as they are associated with the faith of the [[Drowned God]].

Following the extinction of [[House Hoare]], the [[Ironborn]] elected House Greyjoy as [[Lord of the Iron Islands|Lord]] of the [[Iron Islands]], an administrative region of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], as vassals to [[House Targaryen]]. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], House Greyjoy declared for [[House Baratheon]]. During the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], [[Balon Greyjoy]] declared sovereignty and seceded from the Seven Kingdoms, but the rebellion was put down. House Greyjoy bent the knee to [[Robert Baratheon]].

During the [[War of the Five Kings]], Balon Greyjoy declared himself [[King of the Iron Islands]] and the Iron Islands independent once more, seceding from the Seven Kingdoms. Following his [[Assassination of Balon Greyjoy|assassination]] and the [[Kingsmoot on Old Wyk|election]] of his brother and murderer, [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]], as the new King of the Iron Islands, House Greyjoy was divided between Euron and his followers, and Balon's surviving children, [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]], and their followers. During the [[Last War]], Euron allied with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] of [[House Lannister]], while Yara and her followers allied with [[Daenerys Targaryen]], who Euron originally intended to ally with. After being set [[Rescue of Yara Greyjoy|free]] by Theon, Yara [[Retaking of the Iron Islands|retook]] the Iron Islands in Daenerys's name. Theon died at the [[Battle of Winterfell]] while Euron died at the [[Battle of King's Landing]], leaving Yara firmly as the head and last living member of House Greyjoy.

==History==
===Background===
House Greyjoy is one of the [[Great House]]s of [[Westeros]]. Their lands are the [[Iron Islands]] off the west coast of the continent. They rule from their castle [[Pyke]] from the [[Pyke (island)|island of the same name]]. The Iron Islands are harsh and bleak and the Greyjoys have traditionally survived by raiding their neighbors. They have always had plans to conquer the mainland, as their ancient tradition of reaving and plundering made them dominant in the waters. The head of the house is the [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]].<ref name="House Greyjoy viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Greyjoy entry]</ref>

House Greyjoy boasts descent from the [[Grey King]], a legendary [[King of the Iron Islands]] said to have ruled for a thousand years and taken a mermaid as his wife. Like the vast majority of [[Ironborn]], they worship the [[Drowned God]]. The Ironborn would never follow a hereditary ruler; instead they would choose their own monarchs from the Kingsmoot.

Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]] led [[Greyjoy Rebellion|a rebellion]] against King [[Robert Baratheon]] years after the downfall of the Targaryens in Robert's Rebellion. The [[Iron Fleet]], under Euron Greyjoy, sailed for Lannisport and burned the Lannister fleet, which made them unopposed in the Sunset Sea. Balon's sons [[Rodrik Greyjoy|Rodrik]] and [[Maron Greyjoy|Maron]] were killed in the unsuccessful rebellion, the former at Lord Jason Mallister's hand at Seagard and the latter during the Baratheon siege of Pyke. The Iron Fleet would later be defeated by the royal fleet under Stannis Baratheon at Fair Isle. Balon's only surviving son [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] was made a [[ward]] of Lord [[Eddard Stark]] to ensure Balon's submission to King Robert.<ref name="Balon Greyjoy viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/balon-greyjoy/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Greyjoy - Balon Greyjoy entry]</ref> Only his daughter, [[Yara Greyjoy]], and two of his brothers remained on the Iron Islands after his defeat.<ref name="Yara Greyjoy viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/greyjoy/yara-greyjoy/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Greyjoy - Yara Greyjoy entry]</ref>

At some point, Balon exiled his younger brother, [[Euron Greyjoy]], who became a feared pirate that terrorized the seas as far as from [[Oldtown]] in Westeros to [[Qarth]] in [[Essos]].<ref>"[[Home]]"</ref>

==Military strength==
Although House Greyjoy did not maintain a standing army, they were the commanders of the [[Iron Fleet]]. During the [[Last War]], Euron and Yara controlled different factions of the Iron Fleet. Yara had under her command 100 of the best ships from the original Iron Fleet, while Euron expanded the portion of the fleet that was under his control, eventually having 1,000 ships in his faction. During the Last War, Yara's fleet was destroyed during the [[assault on the Targaryen fleet]], eventually only having three ships under her command. Euron's fleet, including the ''[[Silence]]'', was annihilated during the [[Battle of King's Landing]], with little to no surviving ships.

==Family tree==
{{Greyjoy tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Greyjoys have been a powerful family in the Islands for possibly thousands of years, long ruling the formidable castle of Pyke. When King [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]] was slain by King [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] during the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] invasion, the [[ironborn]] elected Lord [[Vickon Greyjoy]] of Pyke to succeed him as ruler of the isles, now oath-sworn to the [[Iron Throne]]. The Greyjoys have ruled ever since. The Greyjoys keep themselves distant from the other Great Houses, rarely taking part in events on the mainland (which they call the green lands) and, at various times, even returning to their ancient practices of raiding the nearby coastlines.

After holding themselves aloof during [[Robert's Rebellion]], Lord Balon Greyjoy rebelled against the Iron Throne, declaring himself King of the Isles. Balon's belief was that Robert, who had only been on the throne for five years, did not command the total support of the nobles due to his status as a usurper and would not be able to rally the support needed to crush the rebellion. He was proven wrong and was defeated, with his fleet burned and two eldest sons slain during the war.

Additional Houses sworn to House Greyjoy, yet to appear in the series, include:

* House Drumm of [[Old Wyk]].
* House Orkwood of [[Orkmont]].
* House Saltcliffe of [[Saltcliffe]].
