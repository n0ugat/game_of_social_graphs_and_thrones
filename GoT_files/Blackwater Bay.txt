'''Blackwater Bay'''{{Ref|GOT202}} is an inlet of the [[Narrow Sea]], located on the east coast of [[Westeros]]. The great city of [[King's Landing]] sits on Blackwater Bay at the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[File:Wildfire explosion.jpg|thumb|Stannis's fleet is destroyed on Blackwater Bay.]]
The fleet of [[Stannis Baratheon]] sails into Blackwater Bay as a prelude to an attack on King's Landing. [[Tyrion Lannister]] destroys part of the fleet with [[wildfire]], but this only manages to delay the landing of a significant number of Stannis' troops, triggering the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Blackwater Bay is a fairly large body of water, held between the arms of [[Crackclaw Point]] to the north and Massey's Hook to the south, with the island of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] guarding the entrance to the bay. Elements of the King's Fleet patrol the Bay and ensure it is kept free from piracy.

Aside from King's Landing and Dragonstone, the largest port on the bay is [[Duskendale]] (which serves as a secondary port for King's Landing when the main port is overwhelmed with traffic), while the largest island is Driftmark, the seat of House Velaryon.
