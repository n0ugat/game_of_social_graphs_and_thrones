'''High Heart'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a hill in the [[Riverlands]], south-east of [[Riverrun]] and near [[Acorn Hall]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, High Heart was sacred to the [[Children of the Forest|children of the forest]]. Around its crown stands a ring of thirty-one [[weirwood]] stumps. The hill is considered a very safe place, due to its relative height compared to the very flat surrounding land that it makes it nearly impossible to be approached unseen.
The nearby smallfolk avoid the area, as it is said to be haunted by the slaughtered Children who had been killed by the [[Andals|Andal]] King Erreg the Kinslayer.

An old woods witch, known as the "ghost of High Heart," lives at High Heart. In ''A Storm of Swords'', the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|brotherhood]] arrives at High Heart and meet her; she tells about her prophetic dreams, which are symbolic visions of both recent and future events (among them [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|Renly's death]] and the [[Red Wedding]]).
