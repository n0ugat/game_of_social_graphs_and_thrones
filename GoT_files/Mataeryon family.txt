The '''Mataeryon family'''<ref name="Shrubbery">[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref>{{Note|Jaehaelor's surname is Mataeryon.}} was one of the forty [[dragonlord]] families of the [[Valyrian Freehold]].

==History==
The seat of the Mataeryons had topless towers, one of which contained [[Jaehaelor Mataeryon]]'s glass orb greenhouse, held in place by thirty-three stone [[sphinx]]es with garnet eyes. It was destroyed in the [[Doom of Valyria]]. Jaehaelor survived the Doom, the last of his line, but died a few years later in [[Volantis]].<ref name="Shrubbery" />

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and their supplementary material, the only dragonlord families named thus far are [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] and Belaerys.
