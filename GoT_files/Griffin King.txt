{{Quote|Except the Vale has been conquered, those vaunted mountains didn't stop the Andals who came by the eastern sea. The people of the Vale say that Ser Artys Arryn, the Andal general, flew on the back of a giant falcon and slew the Griffin King on top of the tallest mountain.|Petyr Baelish|The Vale}}
The '''Griffin King''' was the last of the [[Mountain King]]s, a [[First Men]] dynasty that ruled the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] since the [[Dawn Age]] in [[Westeros]]. He lived at the end of the [[Age of Heroes]] and the beginning of the [[coming of the Andals]].

==Biography==
[[File:Artys_vs_Griffin_King.jpg|thumb|The Winged Knight duels the Griffin King.]]
According to legend, the Griffin King battled the [[Winged Knight]], and was defeated. With the death of the Griffin King, the line of the Mountain Kings was extinguished.{{Ref|H&L122}}{{Ref|H&L316}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, the Griffin King is said to have dueled the Winged Knight atop a mountain known as the Giant's Lance. Like much of the old history Westeros, this story may be a product of myth and confusion.
