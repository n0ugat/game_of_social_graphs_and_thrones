Lady '''Rhaena Targaryen''' is the youngest daughter of [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Laena Velaryon]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Rhaena Targaryen is the youngest daughter of [[Daemon Targaryen]] and [[Laena Velaryon]]. She is the younger sister of [[Baela Targaryen]].{{Guideref|Baela Targaryen}} Rhaena was named in honor of her maternal grandmother, [[Rhaenys Targaryen]].

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
In [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|The Princess and the Queen}} Rhaena and her family live in [[Pentos]], as guests of Prince [[Reggio Haratis]]. Unlike her sister, Rhaena does not have a dragon and her [[Daemon Targaryen|father]] therefore spends little time with her. Her egg never hatched, despite Rhaena keeping it near the fire. Her mother comforts her by saying that many eggs never hatch, and that this does not mean that she will never be a dragonrider. When her mother dies, Rhaena and her older sister are shocked and sad.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Rhaena attends her mother's funeral at [[High Tide]], where she and her sister are warmly welcomed by her grandparents, especially Princess [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]]. At the request of his [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|mother]], [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] tries to comfort the grieving Rhaena.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

That night, Rhaena and her sister witness [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] flying [[Vhagar]], and they run to wake their cousin [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]]. The sisters, along with Jacaerys and his brother [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]], confront Aemond at an entrance to the castle. Rhaena berates him by saying that Vhagar was hers to ride, as she was her mother's dragon, to which Aemond retorts that she should have claimed her when she had the chance. He insults her by suggesting that her cousins could find her a pig to ride, saying that it would suit her. Tempers flare and a fight breaks out, in which Aemond beats up Baela and Rhaena. The [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] burst in and the children are taken to the Hall of Nine. Rhaena witnesses the wedding of Rhaenyra and [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]].{{Ref|HOTD107}}

At some point Rhaena tried to tame a dragon from Dragonstone, the creatures rejected her and she nearly lost her life,{{Ref|HOTD205}} [[Seasmoke]] among them.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

In [[132 AC]],{{Dateref|The Lord of the Tides}} Rhaena lives with her father and his new wife [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] on [[Dragonstone]], Rhaena accompanies Rhaenyra to [[King's Landing]]. Rhaena and Rhaenyra meet [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] in the [[Red Keep]]'s [[godswood]]. Rhaenys is delighted to see her granddaughter, but less so Rhaenyra, who asks Rhaena leave to let them talk in private. With Ser Vaemond's petition to the [[Greens]] imminent, Rhaenys agrees to marry Rhaena to her cousin and future Lord of [[Driftmark]] [[Lucerys Velaryon]], in exchange for backing [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]]'s claim to Driftmark. Rhaena is present to hear Ser [[Vaemond Velaryon]] petition for the inheritance of Driftmark. She is a witness to her father killing Ser Vaemond. In the Evening, Rhaena dines with her entire family, sans Rhaenys, [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] toasts her and [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]]. Tensions rises until a fight ensues, she tries to deescalate the situation by holding back her sister. She leaves [[King's Landing]] without her grandmother and returns to [[Dragonstone]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}
[[File:TBQ Rhaena and Baela Still.jpg|thumb|Rhaena and Baela attend the coronation of Rhaenyra.]]
[[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] offers Rhaenys to grant the inheritance of Driftmark to her granddaughters, if Rhaenys helps maintain the peace.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

Rhaena watches the funeral of [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]] on [[Dragonstone]]. After Rhaenyra is crowned, she and her sister kneel, unlike her grandmother. Rhaena gathers around the [[Painted Table]], as part of the [[Black Council]]. She hands Rhaenyra a cup. She has a hopeful look as her father mentions riderless [[dragon]]s on Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Rhaena is present at the [[Black Council]] when Rhaenyra returns from the [[Stormlands]] and the funeral of her former betrothed [[Lucerys Velaryon]], mourning his loss with tears.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Rhaenyra orders Rhaena to accompany [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] to the Vale, and from there - to take her children [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]] to safety, preferably to Pentos. Rhaena does not like the idea of being a babysitter away from danger, while her sister remains at Dragonstone, but obeys. She is also given four dragon eggs.{{Ref|HOTD203}}
[[File:2x6 Rhaena Targaryen Still.jpg|thumb|Lady Rhaena at the [[Eyrie]].]]
Already at the Eyrie, Rhaena hears Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]] say how impregnable her castle is, unless attacked by dragons. Rhaena reminds Lady Arryn that she promised her 15,000 soldiers in exchange for a dragon, and Rhaenyra fulfilled her promise by sending two dragons to the Vale. Lady Arryn (somewhat annoyed by Rhaena's tone of speech) points out that they are still young and that she cannot afford to wait until they grow up. Jeyne offers her condolences to Rhaena for the death of [[Rhaenys Targaryen|her grandmother]] and before telling her that she is waiting for her for dinner and leaves the girl alone.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Rhaena and her cousin [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] are taking a step outside the [[Eyrie]], escorted by some guards. Rhaena tells Joffrey that she has accepted that she will not participate in the war as a warrior.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Joffrey tells him how he longs for his mother, and Rhaena tries to console him when they come across a large bushel of scorched earth along with several charred sheep's bones, which can means only one thing: in the Vale of Arryn an [[Sheepstealer|adult dragon]] is hiding.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Back at the castle, Rhaena watches her half-brothers, [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]], and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]] while they are playing. Lady Jeyne arrives to tell Rhaena that the [[Reggio Haratis|Prince of Pentos]] has agreed to take her, and her siblings, in, and that a Braavosi merchant cog will take them there. Rhaena blames Lady Jeyne for hiding the fact that there is already a dragon in the Vale, but Jeyne dismisses this since the dragon is wild and cannot be used to defend the Vale.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Rhaena leaves the Eyrie with Aegon and Viserys, under the watch of Lady Jeyne. However, she separates from the others and sets out in search of the wild dragon of the Vale.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Behind the scenes==
On March 30, 2022, [[HBO]] announced that [[Phoebe Campbell]] had been cast in the role of Rhaena Targaryen for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. Her character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|Season 1]] reads as follows:
:''"Second daughter of Lady Laena and sister to Baela."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

Her character description for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|Season 2]] reads as follows:
:''"The younger sister of Lady Baela. Though she is eager to be a dragonrider like her sister, she has not claimed a dragon."''{{Webref|name=WBD2 |author=Unknown author |date=Unknown date |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-s2-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S2 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=June 5, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Rhaena and Baela are described as twins, but not identical twins: they started out looking very similar, but in their teenage years their appearance and personalities diverged. The TV series changed this to make Baela slightly older than Rhaena. In the book, Baela was the elder twin by a matter of minutes.

Rhaena was named in honor of her maternal grandmother, Rhaenys Targaryen. Like her grandmother, both of these names have repeated in the Targaryen dynasty: Rhaenys was named after Aegon I's sister-wife, and the earlier Rhaena was the older sister of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] (himself this Rhaena's great-grandfather).

During the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Rhaena was chosen to accompany [[Joffrey Velaryon]] to [[Gulltown]] for their protection, although they were told it was to defend the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] against the [[Greens]]' dragons. Rhaena brought three dragon eggs with her to the Vale, where she prayed nightly for their hatching.

Rhaena's role during the war was very scant and insignificant: she remained safely at the Vale as Jeyne Arryn's ward, enjoying a life of comfort and privilege. In the show, her character was merged with [[Nettles]]'s book character.
