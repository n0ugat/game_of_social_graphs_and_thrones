A live-action television series of the ''[[World of Westeros]]'' based on '''Aegon's Conquest''' is being discussed at [[HBO]]. Discussion of this project was first rumored in April 2023,<ref name="Variety">[https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/game-of-thrones-prequel-aegons-conquest-hbo-1235570239/ 'Game of Thrones' Prequel About Aegon's Conquest Eyed at HBO - Variety]</ref> but confirmation came on February 9, 2024, when it was revealed that screenwriter [[Mattson Tomlin]] is attached to lead the project. As of early 2024 it is still in the pitch phase and hasn't been officially greenlit.<ref name="Tomlin" />

The [[Aegon's Conquest (Rand Ravich/Far Shariat)|first attempt]] to pitch a prequel about Aegon's Conquest was made in 2017. In summer 2017, HBO announced that five separate prequel pitches were under consideration, none of which were ultimately greenlit. One was about Aegon's Conquest by [[Rand Ravich]] and [[Far Shariat]]. Their script portrayed Aegon the Conqueror as "a drunken lout," and was one of the first pitches rejected by [[HBO]].{{Webref|name=THR |author=James Hibberd |date=July 19, 2022 |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/house-of-the-dragon-game-of-thrones-prequels-1235181929/ |title=Inside ‘House of the Dragon’: The Epic Mission to Make the Next ‘Game of Thrones’ |website=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=December 6, 2023 }}

On April 3, 2023, ''Variety'' revealed that a new prequel about Aegon's Conquest was being considered by HBO. Early talks suggested the potential for a feature component to the project, in which HBO and Warner Bros. could release a theatrical film that would lead directly into the series. No writer was mentioned as being attached to the project at the time.<ref name="Variety" /> Following the straight-to-series order for ''[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', then titled ''A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms: The Hedge Knight'', on April 12, 2023, ''Entertainment Weekly'' revealed that their sources indicated that the Aegon's Conquest prequel was "not happening at this time."<ref name="EW">[https://ew.com/tv/game-of-thrones-prequel-knight-of-the-seven-kingdoms-the-hedge-knight-series-order/ Game of Thrones prequel The Hedge Knight gets series order from HBO | EW.com]</ref>
