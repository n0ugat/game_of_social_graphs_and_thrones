'''House Clegane'''{{Ref|GOT304}} of [[Clegane's Keep]] is an extinct vassal house that held fealty to [[House Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]]. Their lands were southeast of Casterly Rock and consisted of a small patch of land and a modest house named Clegane's Keep. They were landed [[Knighthood|knights]] rather than a full [[noble house]], but had strong ties to the Lannisters.

The former head of the family was Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], known as "The Mountain That Rides," who has since been named to the Kingsguard. Gregor's younger brother, [[Sandor Clegane]], known as "The Hound," was the rightful lord of House Clegane.

The Clegane sigil is three black dogs on a dark yellow background. The three dogs signify the three dogs that died fighting off the [[lion]]ess that attacked [[Tytos Lannister]].<ref name=":0">"[[House Clegane (short)|House Clegane]]"</ref>

==In the books ==
In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', the kennelmaster lost three hounds and a leg in the process of saving Lord Tytos. As a reward, Lord Tytos gave him lands and a tower house and took his son as his squire. Their sigil is three dogs on a yellow field; the three dogs represent the dogs that died saving Lord Tytos. [[Thoros]] disdainfully commented that in view of the atrocities performed by the Cleganes, an image of [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|two]] [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|bloody infants]] would have been more suitable for their House sigil.

Clegane's grandson, Gregor, became notable for his extreme size, and the rumor that he burned his younger brother's face as a child for playing with a toy without asking him. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Gregor proved his worth and ferocity in battle for Tywin, who took note of him and made him one of his inner council of battle leaders, noting that he was the most feared man in the realm.

Gregor's father, his younger sister, and his first two wives all died under unusual circumstances, leaving him and Sandor as the last members of the House.

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Clegane" is pronounced "Cli-GAIN", as opposed to "CLEG-ain", etc.
