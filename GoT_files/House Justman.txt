{{Quote|Even when the [[Riverlands]] finally united under the kings of House Justman, the unusual silence of peace attracted the [[Stormlands|Stormlords]], [[Westerlands|Westermen]] and those bloody [[Ironborn]] to try and take our grain, gold and women.|[[Brynden Tully]]|Riverrun (short)}}
'''House Justman'''{{Ref|H&L617}} is an extinct great house that once ruled the [[Riverlands]] as [[King of the Rivers and Hills|Kings of the Rivers and Hills]].

==History==
House Justman successfully united the [[Riverlands]], though it was not a peaceful reign, as the region still came under attack by forces from the [[Stormlands]], the [[Westerlands]] and the [[Iron Islands]].{{Ref|H&L617}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Justman was founded after the [[coming of the Andals]] by Benedict Rivers, a bastard from Houses [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken|Bracken]]. He defeated the kings of the [[Trident]] over thirty years, crowning himself afterwards. He was a wise king, becoming known as Benedict the Just, which inspired the name of House Justman. He extended his rule to [[Maidenpool]] and the [[Neck]], while his son Benedict II spread his to [[Duskendale]], [[Rosby]] and the mouth of [[Blackwater Rush]].

House Justman ruled for almost three hundred years, with King Bernarr II being the last of its line. Bernarr II's sons were murdered by King [[Qhored Hoare]], the [[King of the Iron Islands]], in the Guest Keep of [[Pyke]], which was afterwards known as the Bloody Keep. Bernarr rose against the [[ironborn]] but was defeated, with the Riverlands falling into anarchy for the next century.

The Riverlands were eventually conquered by the [[Storm King]] Arlan III Durrandon, with various pretenders unsuccessfully claiming to be river kings. Among them was Lucifer Justman, whose blood relation to House Justman was never confirmed.

Semi-canon sources claim their sigil to be golden scales within a blue a double tressure on a white field.
