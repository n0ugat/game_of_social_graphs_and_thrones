The '''Flatlands'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} are a region on the continent of [[Essos]], located to the east of [[Westeros]] beyond the [[Narrow Sea]]. The Flatlands is a fertile area of open fields and plains, located around the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Pentos]] and responsible for feeding it. Many [[Magister|magisters]] and nobles of the cities have estates on the Flatlands.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Flatlands are bordered by the upper reaches of the [[Rhoyne]] to the east, the Velvet Hills to the north and the Golden Fields to the south-east. The [[Dothraki]] have easy access to the Flatlands and find riding across it easy, so Pentosi nobles pay them heavy tribute so as to ensure they do not loot or sack any of the estates or villages in the area.

The Flatlands used to be the southern part of [[Andalos]], the kingdom of the [[Andals]] before they [[Coming of the Andals|migrated to Westeros]] 6,000 years ago.When Tyrion Lannister passes through the region on his way from Pentos to Volantis, as a student of history he notes that his own Andal ancestors lived in these lands thousands of years before.  When he has to come up with a pseudonym while traveling through the area, he jokingly calls himself "Hugor Hill", after the legendary Hugor of the Hill, an Andal king of the region (who for all he knows might be his direct ancestor).
