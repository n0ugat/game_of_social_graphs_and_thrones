{{Quote|There are no men like me. Only me.|Jaime Lannister to [[Catelyn Stark]]|Fire and Blood}}
Ser '''Jaime Lannister''' was the elder son of [[Lord of Casterly Rock|Lord]] [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin Lannister]], younger twin brother of [[King|Queen]] [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], and older brother of [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. He was involved in an [[Incest|incestuous]] relationship with Cersei, and unknown to most, he was the biological father of her three [[bastard]] children, [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]], and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], as well as her unborn child.

During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Jaime killed [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]], earning the derogatory nickname "'''Kingslayer'''." He was pardoned by Robert and allowed to serve in his [[Kingsguard]]. Following Robert's death, he was appointed as the [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] to his son, Joffrey. 

During the [[War of the Five Kings]], Jaime fought for his house, but was captured by [[Robb Stark]] and kept prisoner. He came to an agreement with [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], who decided to release him on condition that her daughters would be safely returned to her. Jaime was paired with [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]], whom Catelyn tasked to have him brought back to the capital. During their travel, Jaime lost his right hand, and revealed the actual reasons why he murdered Aerys. Upon his return to the capital, he continued to serve as Lord Commander to Joffrey, and then to Tommen, but was dismissed from his position after a tense confrontation with the [[Faith Militant]]. He became the new Commander of the Lannister forces, but left his position in order to help the North face the [[Wight|Army of the Dead]]. After the dead were defeated, he was horrified at the fate his sister would await back in the capital, so he went back to help her. 

Jaime died during the [[Battle of King's Landing]], in an attempt to get Cersei out of the capital.

==Biography==
===Background===
Jaime was the eldest son of [[Joanna Lannister]] and Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. Jaime had great difficulty learning to read as a child because he transposed letters in his mind. Tywin sat with him through four hours a day practicing until he learned. Jaime resented being forced to spend so much time on reading.{{Ref|GOT206}}

Jaime was the older brother of [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and the twin brother of Cersei. Their mother died giving birth to Tyrion. Due to his place in the Kingsguard, Jaime could not inherit his father's lands or titles, making Tyrion his father's heir; a fact which vexes Tywin. Unlike Cersei and Tywin, Jaime always treated Tyrion with love, kindness and respect.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Ser Jaime swore to the Mad King.png|thumb|180x180px|The Mad King, Aerys II, proclaims Jaime to his Kingsguard.]]
Jaime began an incestuous relationship with his twin Cersei in his youth. At the age of 16, Jaime rose to the rank of [[knighthood]].{{Note|There is an inconsistency between the show and the ''[[Histories & Lore]]'' about Jaime's age when he was knighted: according to "[[The Prince of Winterfell]]", he was 17 years old; according to "[[The Kingsguard - Jaime Lannister]]" and to Jaime's entry in the ''[[Book of Brothers]]'' (as seen and read aloud in "[[Two Swords]]" and "[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]"), he was 16 years old; according to "[[Robert's Rebellion - Jaime Lannister]]" and to [[Arthur Dayne]]'s entry in the ''Book of Brothers'' (as seen in "[[The Iron Throne]]"), he was 15 years old. The last number matches the information from the novels.}} At the behest of Cersei, he consented to join the [[Kingsguard]], which would prevent his father's plans for him to marry [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa Tully]] from coming into effect. Although initially hesitant (due the fact that Tywin was unable to accept Tyrion as his heir should Jaime be inducted), Jaime agreed, as Cersei's betrothal to [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] would allow the two of them to be in [[King's Landing]] together. However, Tywin erupted in fury and resigned his position as [[Hand of the King]], taking Cersei back to Casterly Rock with him. Jaime was sworn into the Kingsguard by the Mad King, [[Aerys II Targaryen]] during the [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]].{{Ref|H&L606}} He was then the youngest man ever appointed to its membership.{{Ref|GOT208}}

At the conclusion of [[Robert's Rebellion]], Jaime's father Tywin arrived at the gates of King's Landing with the main Lannister army, pledging his allegiance. Most of the small council urged Aerys not to trust Tywin, especially Jaime, knowing his father would never support the losing side of a war. Instead, [[Pycelle]] gave the opposite counsel, and once the Lannister army was allowed inside, Tywin ordered his men to attack the city. As Lannister soldiers raped and pillaged throughout the city during the [[Sack of King's Landing]], King Aerys remained holed up inside the [[Red Keep]], for hours maniacally repeating the order to "burn them all."{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[File:Jamie_Stabs_Aerys.jpg|thumb|Jaime slays the Mad King.[[File:Jaime on the Iron Throne.jpg|thumb|Jaime sits the Iron Throne.]]]]
Despite being sworn by the holiest oaths to protect the king as a member of the Kingsguard, Jaime ultimately turned his own sword on Aerys, slaying him at the foot of the Iron Throne itself. For this infamous act, he is known throughout the Seven Kingdoms as the "Kingslayer", to his irritation.{{Ref|GOT305}}

Jaime always refused to discuss precisely what happened the day he slew the Mad King, and thus his true motivations – and what plans Aerys had for King's Landing – were never revealed. On one occasion he confides the truth to [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]: Aerys's final orders were for Jaime to kill his father, and to [[Wildfire plot|burn the entire city and its inhabitants]] with [[wildfire]]. Unwilling to let that happen, Jaime killed him, and in doing so actually saved thousands of innocent lives. He adds that the "honorable" Ned Stark judged him guilty on the spot, without giving Jaime a chance to explain.{{Ref|GOT305}}

He was forgiven for breaking his vows by King [[Robert Baratheon]] and permitted to remain in the Kingsguard as part of Robert's alliance with House Lannister, along with the marriage of Jaime's twin sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] to Robert. In addition to the slaying of the Mad King, Jaime was known for his handsome looks, arrogant demeanor, and his superior and incredible fighting skills, and for his superb martial skills.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/jbaratheon/jaime-lannister/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of King's Landing - Jaime Lannister entry]</ref> He was so skilled and great with a sword, that he bragged there were only three men in the Seven Kingdoms who might have had a chance against him.{{Ref|GOT208}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]] ===
[[File:Jaime and Cersei 1x01.jpg|thumb|Jaime tries to comfort Cersei.]]
In [[King's Landing]], Jaime counsels Cersei over fears that [[Jon Arryn]] may have discovered their secret prior to his death. Jaime argues that even if he knew, Arryn did not inform the king, for if he had, they would already be dead. If Arryn knew, his knowledge died with him. He accompanies Robert to [[Winterfell]] where the king plans to ask [[Eddard Stark]] to replace Jon Arryn as [[Hand of the King]]. After their arrival, Cersei sends Jaime to find Tyrion. Jaime tracks Tyrion to a brothel, tells him that he is needed at the feast that night and brings him several whores to speed his exit.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Jaime-lannister-1x01-winter-is-coming-jaime-lannister-23125077-1280-720.jpg|thumb|Jaime confronts Bran, before pushing him out a window.]]
At the evening feast, Jaime blocks Eddard's path and asks if there will be a possibility of their competing against each other at a tournament. Eddard dismissively says no, as he doesn't play at fighting, and doesn't show off his skills to let opponents know his abilities. The next day, Eddard and Robert go hunting, leaving the castle largely empty. Cersei and Jaime liaise in a derelict tower. [[Bran Stark|Bran]] climbs the tower, looks through a window and finds them engaged in sexual intercourse. He is caught watching by Cersei, at that point Jaime is able to make it to the window to grab him. Bran is startled by everything he's seen, Jaime looks out the window and only sees Bran's direwolf pup [[Summer]]. He asks Bran how old he is, and he replies, "Ten." Jaime glances momentarily back at Cersei and says, "The things I do for love", and pushes Bran out of the window.{{Ref|GOT101}}

[[File:Jaime_1x02.png|thumb|Tyrion ponders the circumstances of Bran's fall with an uneasy Jaime and Cersei.]]
Several days later at breakfast, Tyrion tells his family that Bran is expected to live and notes his siblings' guarded reactions to the news. Tyrion informs them of his decision to journey north to see the [[Wall]] before returning to King's Landing. Jaime states that it would be kinder to let him die, due to Bran's paraplegia, but Tyrion states he would prefer to live in any case. Jaime then hints that it would be in House Lannister's best interests if Bran were to die.{{Ref|GOT102}}

[[File:Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow 1x02.jpg|thumb|Jaime sarcastically shakes hand with Jon.]]
Just before departing Winterfell, Jaime talks to Jon in the courtyard. Ostensibly, he thanks Jon for his service joining the Night Watch, but in reality he is mocking him, as those from the south see it as waste of time (ironically, Jaime's Kingsguard vows are also for life and prevent him from marrying, but he still gets to live in the capital city and not exiled to the frozen gloom of the Wall). The parties depart Winterfell. Jaime is with the group traveling south to King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT102}}

[[File:Lord Snow Cersei and Jaime.png|thumb|Jaime comforts Cersei.]]
The royal party reaches King's Landing. Eddard barely has time to get off his horse before he is asked to attend a meeting of the king's small council. Jaime awaits him in the throne room. Jaime is unhappy with Eddard judging him for killing the Mad King, the murderer of Eddard's [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]], but Eddard is unapologetic. He says it wasn't justice that drove Jaime to kill Aerys, and that Jaime served Aerys loyally when serving was the easier thing to do. A raven arrives at King's Landing with news of Bran's recovery. In the capital, Cersei fears he will expose their secret, but Jaime comforts her.{{Ref|GOT103}}

[[File:Jaime_Lannister_and_Barristan_Selmy.jpg|thumb|Jaime stands alongside Ser Barristan.]]
Elsewhere, Robert swaps old war stories with Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], a distinguished and famous knight and commander of the Kingsguard. Jaime is called in to join them. He tells them that the first man he killed was an outlaw from the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]], and, as he took off the man's head, there were no last words. Disappointed in not being able to mock him, Robert realizes that he never asked Jaime what Aerys's last words were, then taunts Jaime for killing a defenseless old man he had sworn to protect. Jaime tersely responds that the last thing the Mad King said was the same thing he'd been raving for hours, since the sack of the capital by the rebels began: "Burn them all!" This silences Robert's levity.{{Ref|GOT103}}

Jaime guards the king's bedroom while Robert cavorts with several women, Jaime taking it as a calculated insult to himself and his sister. He reminisces with [[Jory Cassel]], the captain of Eddard's household guards, about the [[Siege of Pyke]] during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] and the fierceness of the fighting. Jory tries to leave Eddard's message with Jaime, but is rebuffed, as Jaime angrily states that he does not serve Lord Stark.{{Ref|GOT104}}

[[File:Eddard_Jaime_Confrontation.jpg|thumb|Jaime confronts Eddard Stark in King's Landing.]]
Upon hearing of his brother's capture by [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], he confronts Eddard in the streets of King's Landing. Knowing that killing Eddard will result in Tyrion's death, he instead has Eddard's guards [[Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel|killed]], stabbing Jory through the eye himself. He and Eddard fiercely cross swords in an intense duel, and Jaime is surprised that Eddard is a match for him. After minutes of dueling, and neither opponent gaining ground on the other, the fight ends abruptly and prematurely when a Lannister guardsmen stabs Eddard through the leg. An irritated Jaime knocks out the guardsman and then departs the city, telling Eddard that he wants his brother back.{{Ref|GOT105}}

[[File:Tywin_and_Jaime.jpg|thumb|Jaime discusses legacy with his father.]]
Jaime joins the army of his father in the field. Tywin laments Jaime's pride and how he spends so much effort trying to convince others he doesn't care what they think of him. Tywin is incredulous and disgusted that Jaime would let Eddard live and go free because his victory was not "clean." He says that if other houses think they can take a Lannister hostage and not suffer for it they will lose respect for the Lannister name. Tywin says that Jaime must accept responsibility for the future destiny of their house, which will be decided by this war against the [[House Tully|Tullys]] and Starks. They will either die out like the Targaryens or begin a dynasty that will last 1,000 years. He gives Jaime thirty-thousand men and sends him to besiege [[Riverrun]]. In King's Landing, Eddard tells Cersei that he knows that Jaime is the true father of Cersei's three children. She admits it, saying they have loved one another from the womb and are destined to be together always.{{Ref|GOT107}}

[[File:Jaime_captured.png|thumb|Jaime is captured by Robb's army.]]
Some weeks later, [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], Jaime's uncle, tells Tyrion that Jaime has won several significant battles, smashing a host of the river lords at the [[Golden Tooth]] and currently laying siege to Riverrun.{{Ref|GOT108}} Robb Stark marches two thousand men towards Tywin's forces in order to create a distraction. The remaining force feints outside Riverrun, drawing out Jaime and a small number of troops to deal with what appears to be a small scouting party, and Jaime is taken prisoner in the resulting [[Battle of Whispering Wood]]. Jaime offers to fight Robb in single combat to decide the war, but Robb knows that Jaime is better at swordplay than he is and says they aren't going to do it his way. Robb initially intends to use Jaime as a bargaining chip for his father's and sisters' lives. However, Eddard is executed in King's Landing before news of Jaime's capture can reach the capital.{{Ref|GOT109}}

Catelyn visits the captive Jaime. He taunts Catelyn, saying widowhood suits her, informing her that he would have sex with her if she was lonely. She hits him in the head with a rock. Jaime knows that the Starks won't kill him as long as his sister holds [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] hostage, but Jaime always taunts others while he is in chains to show them he doesn't fear them and they aren't superior to him. She says he has gone against the laws of gods and man, he says, "What Gods?" Where were her gods when her husband was killed. When she says injustice in the world is because of men like him, he tells her, "There are no men like me. Only me." When asked directly, he admits pushing [[Bran Stark|Bran]] from the tower, but doesn't reveal why.{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[File:GreyWindJaimeFaceToFace.jpg|thumb|Robb uses Grey Wind to intimidate Jaime.]]
Jaime remains a captive of House Stark. [[Robb Stark|Robb]] keeps Jaime caged and chained to a post in his camp at all times to prevent Tywin bribing or threatening one of his bannermen into giving him up. Jaime remains defiant, taunting and insulting Robb when he comes to confront him. [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] has made Joffrey's parentage public, by sending letters to all the lords throughout the kingdom, exposing Jaime's incest with Cersei. Jaime counters that Stannis has a personal stake in these accusations, as if all of Cersei's children are Jaime's bastards that means Stannis is heir to the throne. However it is Jaime who is intimidated when Robb threatens him with the snarling [[Grey Wind]].{{Ref|GOT201}}

[[File:Jaime Lannister in his cell.jpg|thumb|Jaime reminisces about Ser Barristan.]]
Months later, Jaime is joined in his cell by his distant cousin [[Alton Lannister|Alton]]. They talk about the time Alton served as Jaime's squire at a tourney, and Jaime tells him about his own experiences as squire of Barristan Selmy. Drawing Alton closer, Jaime seizes the opportunity to escape. When he leans over to hear Jaime whisper about an escape plan, Jaime head butts him then strikes him in the head repeatedly cracking his skull. When the guard ([[Torrhen Karstark]]) is distracted by discovering Alton's body bloody and convulsing, Jaime strangles him to death and takes his keys to free himself from his chains.{{Ref|GOT207}}

[[File:Catelyn and Jaime.jpg|thumb|Catelyn visits a captive Jaime.]]
Jaime is soon recaptured. [[Rickard Karstark]] demands Jaime's head for killing his son. Catelyn convinces Rickard to wait until Robb returns but fears that his patience will not hold. Catelyn visits Jaime's cell with her female guard [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]. She accuses Jaime of being a man without honor because of his broken vows. Jaime explains his view that his vows frequently conflicted with one another. He asserts that he has more honor than some; he reveals that Cersei is the only one he has slept with and reminds Catelyn how her husband cheated on her and fathered Jon Snow.{{Ref|GOT207}}

[[File:Jaime_and_Brienne.jpg|thumb|Jaime and Brienne escaping on their way to King's Landing.]]
Catelyn makes a deal with Jaime and releases him. She tasks Brienne with escorting him to King's Landing to exchange him for her captive daughters. Brienne successfully smuggles him out of the camp on horseback and then they travel by rowboat to evade pursuit. Jaime needles her about her appearance and masculinity, unsuccessfully attempting to goad her into dueling him.{{Ref|GOT208}}

[[File:Brienne Jaime Stark Men 2x10.png|thumb|Jaime recognized by Stark men.]]
He changes subject, focusing on her virginity and childhood. They find a trio of women, hanged for sleeping with Lannister soldiers. He mocks her service to House Stark and she asserts that she serves Catelyn specifically. As Brienne goes to bury the bodies they are accosted by a trio of Stark soldiers. Brienne kills all three after they recognize Jaime, and he is impressed by her skill. He questions her readiness to kill Stark men and she reasserts her dedication to Catelyn and the task she set her.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Jaime continues to be escorted by Brienne to King's Landing. On their way there, they are spotted by a traveler. Jaime urges Brienne to kill the traveler, since he believes the man recognized him and will give away their whereabouts, but she refuses.{{Ref|GOT302}}

[[File:Brienne_Owns_Jaime.jpg|thumb|Brienne and Jaime spar.]]
Later, the pair have to cross a river, which means they can either attempt a dangerous fording or take the bridge, which will probably be watched. Brienne takes the safer route of the bridge, but Jaime manages to distract her long enough to take away her spare sword and cut his bonds. Brienne and Jaime enter into an extended sword fight on the bridge. Jaime, one of the most skilled swordsmen in all of Westeros, nearly overcomes Brienne several times.{{Ref|GOT302}}

[[File:Briennebacks.jpeg|thumb|Brienne and Jaime slowly back away from Locke.]]
However, Jaime's mobility is reduced because his hands are still manacled, and he is malnourished after having spent the past full year chained up in a cell. Jaime begins to tire, and Brienne wears him down further by making simple body-blows with kicks and punches. After a protracted fight Jaime finally slumps to the ground in exhaustion. Just then, riders from [[House Bolton]] arrive led by a man named [[Locke]]. Jaime asks if they want to negotiate, but Locke says they'll have his head if he doesn't bring the Kingslayer back to the King in the North, so there's not much Jaime can do to dissuade him from taking them prisoner.{{Ref|GOT302}}

[[File:Bolton-troops.png|thumb|Jaime is made a captive of the Bolton entourage. ]]
Along with Brienne, he is taken captive by Locke and his men. As they ride along, the men sing a rousing chorus of "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]." Tied up back to back on one of the horses, Jaime warns Brienne that when they make camp for the night, they will rape her, more than once, and that his honest advice is to give no resistance, and just think of Renly. They were only sent to capture Jaime, therefore Brienne means nothing to them, so at the slightest provocation they will kill her without hesitation. Brienne says she will fight even if they kill her, and Jaime agrees that if he were a woman, he would fight to the death before being raped too.{{Ref|GOT303}}

Later that night Locke's men make camp, and do indeed drag Brienne kicking and screaming into the bushes to gang-rape her. Jaime is disgusted by this pointless brutality, so he points out to Locke that Brienne is actually a noblewoman and the sole heir of Lord [[Selwyn Tarth]], the "Sapphire Isle", and her father will pay them a ransom of her weight in sapphires - provided that she is unharmed. Locke agrees and calls his men back before they are able to rape Brienne, and they tie her up to a tree again. Jaime then tries to smooth-talk Locke once again with offers of how his father Tywin will make him extravagantly rich if he lets Jaime go.{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:Locke-and-Jaime-3x03.jpg|thumb|Locke threatens Jaime.]]
Tiring of Jaime's arrogance and frequent attempts to bribe him into turning over to the Lannister side, Locke decides to prove that Jaime's father will never deal with the likes of him. At first, Locke has his men untie Jaime on the pretext of letting him go after feeding him. But then his men hold Jaime down on a tree stump serving as a chopping block while Locke grabs a carving knife; his reasoning being that maiming Tywin's son will be the ultimate proof that the Lannisters would never deal with Locke, much less bribe him.{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:Jaime's_Hand_gone.jpg|thumb|Jaime's sword hand is severed.]]
Locke mocks Jaime about always relying on his daddy Tywin and that his daddy isn't here. Locke says that Jaime's father can't help him now, and "this should help you remember!" - as he swings down the carving knife and hacks off Jaime's sword-hand. For half a second, Jaime stares at his severed right hand in shock, before what just happened can register in his mind, then he screams in horror.{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:Jaime_beaten.jpg|thumb|Jaime lays helpless in the mud.]]
The following day, Locke's men lead their prisoners Jaime and Brienne horseback. Jaime's severed right hand is tied onto a cord that hangs around his neck. Jaime is physically in agony from his wound, feverish and half-delirious. Barely conscious, he falls headlong off of his horse into the mud. Laying in the mud Jaime is mocked and tormented by Locke and his men, giving him horse urine to drink. However Jaime manages to steal a sword, and unsuccessfully tries to fight them off using only his left hand. Jaime is so weak and feverish that he can barely stand, much less wield a sword and must therefore quickly give up trying. His only hope is that one of the men would give him a small dignified death having a sword in his hand. He eventually succumbs to exhaustion and Locke simply warns him that if he tries that again he'll cut off his other hand.{{Ref|GOT304}}

Later that night Jaime and Brienne are restrained near a campfire. Jaime refuses to eat, and says he wants to die. Brienne says he should try to live for revenge, but Jaime says he was that hand, and without his sword-hand, even if he escapes, he is nothing, and would rather die as the Jaime he was than go on living, robbed of his very identity. Brienne says she overheard when he earlier managed to talk Locke out of letting his men gang-rape her. Brienne is confused, and asks Jaime why he helped her, but he doesn't answer. Brienne grows angry, claiming that this is the first time Jaime had to face the real world where things people care about get taken away. And that he's pathetically moping around like a woman. Her criticism and strength convinces Jaime to start eating.{{Ref|GOT304}}

[[File:Locke taunts Jaime s3e5.jpg|thumb|Jaime is taunted upon his arrival in Harrenhal.]]
The party eventually arrives at Harrenhal, where [[Roose Bolton]] is visibly angered at Locke for maiming Jaime. Jaime asks Bolton about Cersei, and Bolton briefly tortures him emotionally, describing Stannis Baratheon's attack on King's Landing in a way that seems as if he will say Cersei was killed, but he informs him that Tywin and the Tyrell army arrived to drive Stannis away, and Cersei is alive and well. Jaime is so relieved that he falls to his knees. His stump is later tended to by [[Qyburn]], an ex-maester who was expelled from the Order for his unethical but successful experiments. Qyburn implies that he may need to cut off Jaime's arm to stop the corruption spreading, but Jaime threatens to kill him if he does, so Qyburn agrees to only cut away the rotting flesh, and offers Jaime milk of the poppy to ease the pain, but Jaime, fearing that Qyburn will sedate him and still amputate his arm, refuses, and screams in agony as Qyburn starts operating on him.{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[File:Jaime_recounts_the_past_s3e5.jpg|thumb|Jaime recounts the story of slaying the Mad King.]]
While Brienne is bathing alone in baths of Harrenhal, Jaime approaches and slips into the opposite corner. He makes a snide remark about Brienne unable to protect [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] and for being the reason he died. She stands defiantly, and he quickly apologizes, claiming that Brienne has protected him better than most. Jaime begins to open up to Brienne, and tells his side of what happened the day he slew the Mad King. He reveals to a shocked Brienne the truth of that day, something he has never told anyone else: Aerys's final orders were for Jaime to kill his father, and to [[Wildfire plot|burn the entire city and its inhabitants]] with [[wildfire]].{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[File:Brienne and Jaime Kissed by Fire.jpg|thumb|Jaime faints in Brienne's arms.]]
Unwilling to let that happen, Jaime killed him, and in doing so actually saved thousands of innocent lives before Ned Stark entered the throne room and saw the aftermath. Brienne asks Jaime why he never told anyone if all of this is true. Jaime replies that Ned Stark judged him guilty the moment he laid eyes on him, and he vents, "By what right does the wolf judge the lion?" He begins to pass out and collapses in Brienne's arms. She calls for the guards to help the Kingslayer, but he corrects her and says his name is Jaime.{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[File:Jaime_The_Climb.jpg|thumb|Jaime in discussions with Roose Bolton.]]
While sitting at the dinner table with Brienne and Roose, Jaime clumsily tries to cut his meat with one hand until an annoyed Brienne helps him. Roose tells Jaime that wars cost money and that many people would pay a great deal of money for him. After discussing how busy Tywin is battling Robb all over the North, Jaime informs Roose that his father would make time for him. Roose tells Jaime, that when he is well enough to travel, he will allow him to return to King's Landing on the condition that he will tell Tywin the truth, that he had nothing to do with his maiming.{{Ref|GOT306}}

Roose does not allow Brienne to join Jaime however. Jaime protests and insists that she must go with him, but Roose claims that she must stay because she is charged with abetting treason. Before Roose heads off to the [[Twins]], Jaime jokingly tells him to send his regards to Robb, a task that Roose actually does carry out right before killing the Young Wolf.{{Ref|GOT306}}

[[File:Jaime_Harrenal_Bear_and_Maiden_Fair.jpg|thumb|Jaime leaves Harrenhal and begins his journey back to King's Landing.]]
Jaime arrives in Brienne's chambers to tell her goodbye before he leaves for King's Landing. He informs her that Roose Bolton has demanded she stay behind with Locke. He tells Brienne that he owes her a debt. Brienne tells Jaime that if he keeps his word to Catelyn the debt will be paid. Jaime promises that he will return the Stark girls to their mother.{{Ref|GOT307}}

Along their travel back to the Capital, the group stops for Qyburn to medicate Jaime's healing stump. Jaime notes that Qyburn's work is more effective than Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] and asks why he was expelled from the Order of Maesters. Qyburn tells him that it was because his experiments were "too bold." When Jaime mocks him, Qyburn subtly bashes him for all the lives he has taken while in the Kingsguard. Qyburn informs Jaime that [[Selwyn Tarth]] offered 300 [[Money#Westeros|gold dragons]] for Brienne's return, but Locke refused; believing that Lord Selwyn has all the sapphire mines in Westeros. Locke, feeling cheated, would make Brienne the men's entertainment for the night. Jaime senses a feeling of obligation to Brienne, knowing it is his fault for Locke believing there is a fortune in sapphires in Tarth. He approaches [[Steelshanks]] and tells him they are to return to Harrenhal. Jaime threatens that he will tell his father upon arrival in Kings Landing, that Steelshanks chopped his hand off. Or, he says he could tell his father that Steelshanks saved his life.{{Ref|GOT307}}

[[File:Boltonmen3.jpg|thumb|Jaime criticizes Locke's treatment of Brienne.]]
Steelshanks relents and escorts Jaime back to Harrenhal, where he finds Brienne being forced to fight a bear in a gladiatorial pit, using only a wooden sword. Jaime dives into the pit to aid her, forcing Steelshanks to aid them both by firing arrows at the bear. Jaime and Brienne narrowly escape the bear, and he once again demands that she accompanies him, asking Locke whether he believes Bolton would prefer to reward him or to ensure that Jaime reaches King's Landing. This time, Locke relents, and Jaime and Brienne depart together.{{Ref|GOT307}}

[[File:Jaime_Mhysa_finale_returns.jpg|thumb|Jaime returns to Cersei in the Red Keep.]]
Jaime walks into the gates of King's Landing with Brienne and Qyburn. A worker pulling a cart orders that he move out of the way, calling him a "Country Boy." Jaime immediately returns to Cersei back at the [[Red Keep]]. He steps into her room and notices her admiring a seashell fondly. He says her name and as she turns, he notices she is taken aback by his stump.{{Ref|GOT310}}

[[File:Tywinjaimenewsword.png|thumb|Jaime wields a newly fresh-forged Valyrian steel sword with his left hand.]]
Jaime is offered a sword by his father Tywin which is made of [[Valyrian steel]] from the recently reforged [[Ice]], the Starks' ancestral sword. Jaime comments that House Lannister has always wanted its own Valyrian blade and Tywin answers that they now have two. The original was absurdly large and had plenty of steel for two swords. He then reveals to Jaime his plan to have him removed from the Kingsguard so that he can return to [[Casterly Rock]] and rule as Lord in his stead. However, Jaime tells him that he has no plans of resigning and that he will remain in King's Landing to protect the King (and secretly continue his incestuous relationship with Cersei). He also rejects that this is about his honor, as he believes that his honor is too far gone so he might as well do what he wants rather than what is expected of him. Tywin agrees to let him do so, but tells him that he no longer considers him a Lannister. Despite this, Tywin allows Jaime to keep the sword, saying that a 'one-armed man with no family needs all the help he can get'.{{Ref|GOT401}}

[[File:Jaimehandfitted.png|thumb|Qyburn fits Jaime's steel hand.]][[File:Jaime-lannister-2.jpg|thumb|Jaime wants to make love with his sister, but she refuses him.]]
Cersei later offers Jaime a golden hand to cover his stump. As Qyburn fits it to him, he complains about it, believing it to be useless. He later tries to get intimate with Cersei but she refuses him saying that she blames him for leaving King's Landing after his fight with Ned Stark and for getting captured. Jaime protests that he [[Alton Lannister|murdered]] [[Torrhen Karstark|people]] so he could get back to her, but Cersei coldly replies, "You took too long."{{Ref|GOT401}}

[[File:Briennejaimetalkingsansa.png|thumb|Jaime and Brienne discuss Sansa's safety.]]
Jaime, Meryn, and Joffrey are later discussing which Kingsguard will be where in the wedding. Joffrey is paying no attention because he thinks he is safe now that the war is over but Jaime tells him that the war is not over while Stannis still lives. Later, Jaime and Brienne discuss what to do with Sansa. Brienne says that Jaime must keep his vow and get Sansa out of King's Landing, but Jaime says that her family are dead and there is nowhere to take her that is safer than King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT401}}

[[File:Jaime_in_The_Lion_and_the_Rose.jpg|thumb|Jaime talks with his brother.]]
In Tyrion's​ chambers, he and Jaime share a drink. Tyrion states that he is impressed with Jaime's new hand, saying that it's much better than the old one. Jaime brings up a dilemma of his: He can't use a sword, and he can't train, because it will be humiliating. Tyrion says he knows just the man, which is [[Bronn]]. Jaime and Bronn meet up by the sea to train, Jaime is worried that someone might hear them, but Bronn responds that he routinely has sex with a married woman in that place and that she is a screamer; if no one heard her, no one will hear them.{{Ref|GOT402}}

[[File:Joffrey points.jpg|thumb|Cersei and Jaime watch as Joffrey accuses Tyrion in his final moments.]]
At the wedding feast, Jaime is standing in his spot in the Kingsguard formation, where [[Loras Tyrell]] accidentally bumps into him and they talk about Cersei. Jaime says that Loras will never marry Cersei, that she would kill him and any child conceived on their wedding night; not that it matters since Loras will never marry her. Loras replies that neither will Jaime, a subtle barb to their incestuous relationship.{{Ref|GOT402}}

When Joffrey is dying after being poisoned by [[Olenna Tyrell]], Jaime rushes to his son's aid and is with him while he dies.{{Ref|GOT402}}

[[File:403 Joffrey funeral 5.jpg|thumb|Jaime attends Joffrey's funeral.]]
Jaime enters to [[Great Sept of Baelor]] to see Cersei and his dead son, asking Tommen if he is coping well with the situation. Jaime sends the septon and septas away so he can be alone with Cersei. Cersei wants the death of the accused Tyrion and his wife Sansa. She asks Jaime to kill Tyrion for murdering their son because she is sure Tyrion will talk his way out of it. Jaime refuses, almost positive that Tyrion did not kill their son and tries to comfort her through his affections.{{Ref|GOT403}}

[[File:403kissing1.png|thumb|Jaime and Cersei have sex before Joffrey's corpse. ]]
Cersei initially kisses Jaime then pulls away and turns back to her dead son after which Jaime proclaims "''You're a hateful woman, why have the gods condemned me to love a hateful woman?''" Jaime then becomes aggressive, tearing at her dress. Cersei insists his actions are inappropriate and repeatedly asks Jaime to stop, but he refuses. They embrace and proceed to have rough, angry sex on the floor in front of Joffrey's corpse.{{Ref|GOT403}}

[[File:Screen-shot-2014-02-10-at-5-58-15-pm.png|thumb|Bronn training Jaime to fight with his left hand.]]
Some time later, Jaime and Bronn are training, and it seems that Jaime has improved his sword skills with his left hand as he begins to overpower Bronn. Bronn then takes off Jaime's golden hand and slaps him with it and he falls to the ground, with Bronn lecturing Jaime as to the value of being willing to fight dirty. Jaime asks Bronn his opinion on the murder; Bronn says that Tyrion is innocent, and is shocked when he realizes that Jaime hasn't yet gone to see Tyrion, since Tyrion's original choice for his [[First trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] at the [[Eyrie]] was Jaime. After hearing this, he visits Tyrion. Convincing Jaime that he didn't kill Joffrey, Tyrion notes that not even an irrefutable confession by the real perpetrator would satisfy Cersei. She is out for Tyrion's blood, and he says that the trial is even worse because at least one judge has always wanted him dead. Jaime tells Tyrion that Cersei offers a knighthood to whomever captures Sansa. Tyrion insists that Sansa had nothing to do with the murder, despite having the best motive.{{Ref|GOT404}}

[[File:Jaime_and_Brienne.png|thumb|Jaime tasks Brienne with finding and protecting Sansa.]][[File:Jaime presents podrick to brienne.png|thumb|Jaime gives Podrick in service to Brienne.]]
Jaime visits Cersei on her request, but is disappointed when she only wishes to know Kingsguard formations for Tommen, concerned with the safety of Tommen following the assassination of Joffrey. She asks him if he would break his oath to Catelyn by hunting down and murdering Sansa, who Cersei believes killed Joffrey, aided by Tyrion. She then confronts him about visiting Tyrion. Jaime tries to convince Cersei that their brother is innocent, but she refuses to listen and tells him to leave, demanding more protection for Tommen.{{Ref|GOT404}}

Jaime and Brienne talk in the [[White Sword Tower]] about Jaime's honor, which he hopes to reclaim. He gives Brienne his new sword and armor and tells her to find and protect Sansa, to keep her somewhere safe, far away from his sister. He also gives her another present: a squire, [[Podrick Payne]]. She is reluctant at first, thinking that he will slow her down, but she accepts. Brienne names the sword Oathkeeper, and bids farewell to Jaime. They are both emotionally affected as he watches her leave the capital.{{Ref|GOT404}} Jaime is present at Tommen's coronation along with other Kingsguard.{{Ref|GOT405}}

[[File:Jaime_in_The_Laws_of_Gods_and_Men.jpg|thumb|Jaime tells Tyrion of his and Tywin's plan to let him join the Night's Watch.]]
Jaime is ordered by his father to have Tyrion shackled before his trial. It is clear that the trial is a farce, as Tyrion has no one to speak for him, and Cersei has gathered numerous witnesses to provide circumstantial evidence against her brother, all of whom miss out key contextual details. At recess, an angered Jaime goes to Tywin and offers him a deal; he will leave the Kingsguard and take his place as Tywin's heir if Tyrion's life is spared. Tywin immediately agrees, saying that Tyrion will be declared guilty and allowed to join the Night's Watch. Tywin's rapid agreement makes Jaime realize that this was his plan from the start, but he nevertheless agrees. Before the trial resumes, he tells Tyrion of the plan, but can only watch as [[Shae]]'s testimony sends Tyrion over the edge, resulting in him demanding a [[trial by combat]].{{Ref|GOT406}}

[[File:Jaime_in_Mockingbird.png|thumb|Jaime angry at Tyrion after the failed plan to get him join the Night's Watch.]]
After the trial, Jaime berates Tyrion in his cell for his outburst and not going through with the deal he made with Tywin. Tyrion knew that the deal was everything his father wanted and could not go through with it. Jaime points out that, despite his practice with Bronn, his current skill with a sword would be useless in a trial by combat. Tyrion jokes how devastating it would be for Tywin if Jaime were to die in his trial by combat. Jaime then tells Tyrion who Cersei has chosen as their champion: Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].{{Ref|GOT407}}

On the day of the trial by combat, when [[Oberyn Martell]] has agreed to fight for Tyrion, Jaime visits Tyrion in his cell. They discuss their dead cousin [[Orson Lannister]] and his habit of smashing beetles with rocks for no reason. Tyrion says he used to watch Orson for long periods of time and think about the reason behind his actions, but he hasn't come to any conclusion why all those countless beetles had to be killed. When Jaime says he doesn't know either, bells start tolling and he wishes Tyrion good luck. Shortly after, he seats himself next to Tywin, [[Mace Tyrell]], Cersei, Pycelle and [[Varys]] in the royal box to watch the duel. He exchanges a few supportive and cheerful looks with Tyrion when Oberyn seems to be winning, but is very unhappy at the result of the trial by combat, which condemns his brother to death - the Mountain crushing Oberyn's skull with his bare hands.{{Ref|GOT408}}

[[File:Kingsguard White Sword Tower original sigil table.jpg|thumb|Jaime and Cersei make love after Cersei tells Tywin of their relationship.]]
Cersei finds Jaime in the White Sword Tower, and he expresses disgust at her blatant attempts to have Tyrion killed. Cersei accuses that Tyrion killed their mother when she gave birth to him. Jaime is surprised that she still irrationally blames him for that, pointing out that he was an infant and had no control over what happened. He insists that Tyrion is her family whether she chooses to accept it or not. She rebukes his claim, saying he is not her family and that they all have a choice, and that she chooses Jaime. She then reveals that she has spilled their secret to Tywin. He is stunned by her actions, asking how Tywin reacted to the news, but she states that she does not want to discuss their father. Cersei begins to seduce him, saying she chooses her brother over everyone else in the world, no longer concerned with whether everyone else knows their secret. Jaime yields to her advances, kissing her passionately and throwing her on the table where they begin to have sex.{{Ref|GOT410}}

[[File:Game-thrones-3-600x450.jpg|thumb|Jaime rescues Tyrion.]]
Jaime's discontent with the result of the trial leads him to break Tyrion out of jail, and arrange his brother's escape to [[Essos]] using Varys's aid to ship him across the sea. He leads Tyrion to a stairway leading up to a locked door, instructing Tyrion to knock on it twice and then twice more to summon Varys, who will lead him to the ship. Before they part ways, they share a tender embrace and say their goodbyes, unsure if either will ever see each other again.{{Ref|GOT410}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[File:Cersei jaime sept wars to come.jpg|thumb|Cersei chastises Jaime in the Great Sept.]]
During the funeral of his father, Jaime meets with Cersei in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Jaime warns his sister that all the power and prestige their father built for House Lannister belongs to them now and that, once everyone sees that Tywin is truly dead, their enemies will do everything they can to take it away from them. Cersei bluntly states that their true enemy is Tyrion and that Jaime is partly responsible for Tywin's death since he was the one who released their father's murderer. He is left alone in the Sept, looking at his father's corpse and feeling guilty.{{Ref|GOT501}}

[[File:5x02-02.jpg|thumb|Cersei shows Jaime the "gift" from Dorne.]]
Jaime is summoned by Cersei, who has received a "gift" from [[Dorne]]: an ornately carved viper, with [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]'s unique Lannister pendant suspended from its fangs. Both siblings understand the gift as a threat from [[House Martell]]. Even though she is equally to blame for covering up their incest, Cersei lashes out at Jaime for not being a father to any of their children, to which he points out that if he had been, their children would be stoned in the streets. Jaime declares that he will bring Myrcella home, but Cersei mockingly asks how a one-handed man can rescue a princess alone. Jaime tells her that he never said he was going alone.{{Ref|GOT502}}

Later, Jaime goes to [[Castle Stokeworth]] in order to recruit Bronn on his mission to return Myrcella to King's Landing. To convince him to go, Jaime reveals that Cersei has arranged for [[Wyllis Bracken]] to marry [[Lollys Stokeworth]] instead of Bronn, and offers him a much better girl than Lollys and a much better castle once they return from [[Dorne]].{{Ref|GOT502}}

During the journey to Dorne, Bronn pushes Jaime for answers as to why he is rescuing Myrcella personally instead of sending an army. Jaime responds that he does not want to start a war, but Bronn insinuates that he knows Myrcella is actually Jaime's daughter and not his niece. He also warns Jaime on the impulsiveness of the Dornish people, and asks if Jaime set Tyrion free. Jaime claims it was Varys. Bronn asks Jaime to give Tyrion his regards should he see him again, but Jaime responds by saying that if he ever sees Tyrion again, he will kill him in revenge for their father.{{Ref|GOT504}}

[[File:Jaime_sword_fight_dorne_s5.png|thumb|Jaime uses his metal hand to stop a blade.]]
Not long after, Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne, where Bronn narrowly saves Jaime from being poisoned by a viper. As they make their way towards Dorne, they are discovered by Dornish soldiers and a fight ensues. Jaime personally duels one of the soldiers and holds his own with his left hand until he is disarmed. The man moves in to kill Jaime, who catches the blade in his metal hand and uses the distraction to get his sword and finish his opponent. Over Bronn's protests, Jaime insists that they bury the soldiers in order to avoid suspicions. Unbeknownst to either, [[Ellaria Sand]] and the [[Sand Snakes]] are aware that Jaime is coming for Myrcella.{{Ref|GOT504}}

[[File:Jaimelannister-s5e6.jpg|thumb|Jaime is threatened by the point of Areo Hotah's longaxe.]]
Jaime and Bronn, disguised as Dornish soldiers, finally reach the Water Gardens and find Myrcella with [[Trystane Martell]]. Myrcella is understandably surprised to see her alleged uncle in Dorne, but as Jaime attempts to persuade his daughter to flee with him, they are attacked by the Sand Snakes, who plan to kill Myrcella in order to force [[Doran Martell]] into war with the Lannisters to avenge Oberyn Martell's death. Jaime and Bronn [[Confrontation in the Water Gardens|fight]] with the Sand Snakes, with Jaime focused on [[Obara Sand]], until Doran's bodyguard, [[Areo Hotah]], appears with a handful of Martell guards and orders them to stand down. Jaime is briefly mocked by Areo for his missing hand before he drops his weapon, and he, Bronn, the Sand Snakes and Ellaria Sand are all arrested.{{Ref|GOT506}}

[[File:The Gift 07.jpg|thumb|Myrcella and Jaime talk about Trystane.]]
Jaime is locked up in a bedroom-like cell. Areo brings Myrcella to visit him. Jaime tells her that the situation has grown dangerous and he needs to take Myrcella back to King's Landing, though he fails to mention that it is because the Dornishmen seek to use her as a way to gain revenge for Oberyn. She soundly rejects his advice and claims she wants to stay in Dorne and marry Trystane, before leaving him alone.{{Ref|GOT507}}

[[File:Jaime in Sunspear with Areo Hotah.png|thumb|Jaime is escorted to meet Doran.]]
Later, Jaime is escorted into the main apartments of the Water Gardens by Areo Hotah, to be received by Prince Doran Martell in his solar, along with Ellaria, Trystane and Myrcella. He comments on the nature of Myrcella's clothes, suggesting that they are too revealing, covering this suggestion up by asking if she is cold. She rebuffs this, stating that she is suited to the Dornish climate. Doran asks Jaime why he has snuck into Dorne to abduct Myrcella back to King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT509}}

[[File:Meeting in dorn jaime myrcella.jpg|thumb|Jaime is received in Prince Doran Martell's solar.]]
He says he feared for her safety, but when Doran insists as to why he didn't just send a letter by messenger raven, he explains that they received a threatening message: Myrcella's Lannister lion pendant jammed in the mouth of dead viper. Jaime asks if Doran intends to behead him, but he says that he will not, because he wishes to avoid war. Doran insists that for the alliance between the Iron Throne and Dorne to continue, the engagement of Trystane and Myrcella must stand, and Trystane will simply take his uncle Oberyn's place on the small council. Jaime finds Doran's request entirely reasonable, and Myrcella is ecstatic that she will not be separated from Trystane, so Jaime agrees.{{Ref|GOT509}}

Ellaria later visits Jaime in his quarters and pretends to make amends with him, acknowledging that neither he nor Myrcella played any part in Oberyn's death, but expresses her knowledge that Myrcella is not Jaime's niece, but his daughter. Before leaving, she mocks him for not being born centuries ago into the Targaryen family, in which position his incest would have been accepted.{{Ref|GOT509}}

[[File:Jaime_&_Myrcella_(S05E10).jpg|thumb|Jaime embraces Myrcella as his daughter moments before her unexpected death.]]
Jaime, Bronn, Myrcella, and Trystane say their farewells to the Martells to return to King's Landing. Upon saying goodbye, Ellaria kisses Myrcella on the lips. Aboard the ship, Myrcella and Jaime talk about Cersei. Jaime begins to come clean to Myrcella, awkwardly telling her that one cannot choose who he/she love. Myrcella then reveals that she knows that Jaime is her real father, and that she is glad that he is, and the two embrace. However, Myrcella's nose starts to bleed and she collapses and dies in Jaime's arms, a victim of poison from Ellaria's kiss.{{Ref|GOT510}}

Jaime returns from Dorne with Myrcella's corpse. He then comforts Cersei in her quarters and the conversation shifts to the death of their mother. Cersei then tells Jaime about the prophecy that [[Maggy]] told her as a child concerning the deaths of her children. Jaime brushes this off, insisting that they are the only two who have ever mattered and promising they will take back everything that has been stolen from them. Aware that Doran Martell had nothing to do with Myrcella's murder, Jaime sends Doran a letter demanding the heads of Ellaria and the three Sand Snakes responsible, which leads to the [[Coup in Dorne|deaths of Doran and Trystane at Ellaria's hands]].{{Ref|GOT601}}

Jaime and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] later mourn Myrcella in the Sept of Baelor. Jaime informs Tommen they haven't found Trystane's killers, though Tommen suspects Cersei was involved. When Jaime asks why he has not allowed his mother to pay respects, Tommen informs Jaime that the [[High Sparrow]] has forbidden Cersei from entering the Sept. Jaime reassures Tommen that he will not let the Sparrows imprison her again while he is in the city and asks Tommen why has he not visited his mother yet. As Tommen questions his ability to rule and protect his family, the High Sparrow arrives and Jaime orders Tommen to go see his mother. Jaime is furious at what the High Sparrow has done to Cersei and considers killing him on the spot but backs down when the fanatics surround him. The High Sparrow then revels in the idea that he has managed to take control of King's Landing, effectively ruling the Seven Kingdoms, angering Jaime further.{{Ref|GOT602}}

[[File:Oathbreaker 23.jpg|thumb|Jaime and Cersei try to intervene on the small council.]]
Jaime and Cersei later visit Qyburn's lab accompanied by Gregor Clegane. As Cersei asks Qyburn to sway more of Varys' spies to her cause, Jaime wonders aloud on the ex-maester's treatment of Clegane, causing the Mountain to glare at him in anger. After meeting Qyburn, Jaime, Cersei and Gregor interrupt a small council meeting to demand a discussion on what to do about the Sparrows and Ellaria Sand's coup in Dorne. Kevan and Olenna remind Cersei of her place, but Jaime, being Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, asserts he can stay. Instead, Kevan and the Council refuse to continue to meet while Gregor Clegane is present and promptly leave the council chamber.{{Ref|GOT603}}

Later, after Cersei learns from Tommen that the High Sparrow means to have [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] perform a Walk of Atonement, she and Jaime try to appeal to the Council again. This time, they agree to work together to remove the High Sparrow from power. Jaime convinces his uncle to keep the Lannister forces in reserve but have the Tyrell army go to the Great Sept of Baelor and free Margaery and Loras, though Kevan warns that the High Sparrow has many supporters and thousands could die in the ensuing civil war.{{Ref|GOT604}}

[[File:Blood of My Blood 11.jpg|thumb|Jaime arrives with a Tyrell army in an attempt to free Ser Loras and Queen Margaery from the Sparrows.]]
Jaime meets Mace Tyrell and his army by the city gate and rides with the Lord of Highgarden to the Great Sept. As the High Sparrow is addressing the crowd, the Tyrell force marches into the square at the foot of the Sept's stairs. Just as it seems it will come to blood, the High Sparrow announces he will be releasing Margaery due to a new alliance between the Crown and the Faith, and Tommen emerges from the Sept with the rest of the Kingsguard. Jaime is shocked and enraged, and he gives the High Sparrow a scornful glare.{{Ref|GOT606}}

[[File:Cersei jaime blood of my blood.jpg|thumb|Cersei orders Jaime retake Riverrun.]]
After the failed attempt at the Great Sept, Tommen removes Jaime from the Kingsguard. He commands him to take an army to [[Riverrun]], which was recently captured by the [[Brynden Tully|Blackfish]] and the [[House Tully|Tully]] army, and help the [[House Frey|Freys]] retake the castle. Jaime later informs Cersei of this, angry that the High Sparrow has swayed Tommen to his side and threatening to attack the Sept with help from Bronn and other sellswords. Instead, Cersei advises Jaime to lead the Lannister forces to Riverrun, confident the Mountain will win her trial by combat. She kisses Jaime goodbye, reminding him their enemies have always underestimated them.{{Ref|GOT606}}

[[File:The Broken Man 09.jpg|thumb|Jaime reinforces House Frey's forces at the Siege of Riverrun.]]
Jaime arrives at Riverrun accompanied by Bronn and an army of 8,000 Lannisters. He witnesses [[Lothar Frey]] and Black [[Walder Rivers]] threatening to kill [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]] if the Blackfish doesn't surrender. Knowing his nephew is too valuable to lose, the Blackfish dismisses them and Edmure is spared. Jaime remarks on the Freys' poor attempts at siege warfare and points out that threatening to hang Edmure and then not doing so makes them look weak. To prove his point, he threatens to strike Black Walder if he speaks again; when Black Walder begins to answer, Jaime slaps him hard with his armored hand, drawing blood. Jaime assumes command of the siege and orders Edmure to be washed and fed. Jaime then sends word to Brynden that he wishes to [[parley]].{{Ref|GOT607}}

[[File:607 As Long as I'm Standing.png|thumb|Jaime meets with the Blackfish.]]
He comes face to face with Brynden, but it quickly becomes clear that the Blackfish is not interested in surrendering. He asks Jaime whether he has come to honor his vow to his niece and return her two daughters. Brynden quips that "negotiating with an oathbreaker is like building on quicksand", declaring that he is ready to die in his home. He challenges Jaime to either storm the castle or try to starve them out, claiming that they have two years worth of provisions. Brynden then asks Jaime, "Do you have two years?"{{Ref|GOT607}}

[[File:No One 02.jpg|thumb|Jaime discusses Sansa with Brienne during the siege of Riverrun.]]
A few days into the siege, Brienne arrives at Riverrun to seek an alliance with House Tully to fight the Boltons. As she and Jaime discuss the situation privately in a tent, Bronn asks Pod if he thinks they are having sex and says that Jaime would definitely have sex with her. Meanwhile, Brienne tells Jaime that she fulfilled their oath to Catelyn and explains Sansa's desire for aid from the Blackfish. She proposes that if she can convince the Blackfish to surrender the castle, then Jaime will allow him and the Tully army safe passage to the North.{{Ref|GOT608}}

[[File:No One 23.jpg|thumb|Brienne offers Oathkeeper to Jaime.]]
Jaime agrees and allows Brienne to enter Riverrun and try to convince Brynden to surrender. She then removes Oathkeeper and tries to return it to Jaime, since the purpose he lent it to her for (rescuing Sansa) has been fulfilled, but he refuses to take it back, saying that it's hers now. Brienne reminds him that her oath to Sansa will obligate her to fight him if her efforts to find a peaceful solution should fail if he attacks the castle. Jaime responds by saying that he hopes that it does not come to that.{{Ref|GOT608}}

[[File:No One 25.jpg|thumb|Jaime threatens Edmure.]]
After Brienne fails to persuade the Blackfish, Jaime visits Edmure to offer him a deal, trying to tempt him with seeing his son and sending him, his son and his wife, [[Roslin Tully|Roslin Frey]] to Casterly Rock, offering them comfortable rooms. Jaime promises that Edmure's son will be taken care of, that he will be given knights to train, and a keep of his own desire when he comes of age. Edmure ridicules Jaime. Jaime, realizing he cannot peacefully try to persuade Edmure into surrendering the castle, responds by warning him that people can do anything for love, threatening that he will kill every Tully in order to be able to return to King's Landing and be with Cersei again. With his family's life credibly threatened, Edmure agrees to cooperate.{{Ref|GOT608}}

Despite Brynden's protests, the gates are opened to Edmure and Jaime takes the castle without bloodshed. On the castle walls, Jaime is informed of the Blackfish's death, leaving him visibly saddened. He then witnesses Brienne and Pod escaping in a boat, but allows them to leave, waving goodbye to Brienne.{{Ref|GOT608}}

Jaime then marches to the Twins with the Freys as they celebrate their retaking of Riverrun. Jaime notices a [[Arya Stark|serving girl]] who smiles at him. Bronn then complains that all the women desire Jaime, who then calls over two young girls and introduces them to the knight. He then speaks to Walder Frey, who gloats about their victory. When Walder attempts to equate himself with Jaime, calling them both kingslayers, Jaime is visibly irritated. Walder goes on to say that fear is a marvelous thing but Jaime retorts that people fear the Lannisters, not the Freys, and questions the need for the Freys if the Lannisters have to keep helping the Freys hold the Riverlands. Walder does not respond and Jaime brusquely leaves. Walder and his sons, Black Walder and Lothar, are later [[Assassinations at the Twins|murdered]] by the same serving girl that smiled at Jaime earlier, who reveals herself to be Arya.{{Ref|GOT610}}

That evening, Jaime arrives at the throne room of the Red Keep in time to witness Cersei's coronation, but is visibly displeased that Tommen, their last child, is dead and his sister-lover has committed the very atrocity that Jaime prevented at such great personal cost when he killed the Mad King.{{Ref|GOT610}}

[[File:GoT-Sn7 FirstLook 01.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Jaime stands with Cersei during her audience with Euron Greyjoy.]]
Cersei and Jaime discuss their strategy and their enemies. Jaime points out their lack of allies and questions Cersei's power. He expresses his will to discuss Tommen's suicide, but she refuses, calling their youngest child a traitor. She later reveals that she has considered a new ally, [[Euron Greyjoy]]. Euron arrives to ask Cersei to marry, but she declines, stating that she cannot trust him. Jaime then reminisces about Euron's primary role in the Greyjoy Rebellion, including the [[Sack of Lannisport]] and is less then impressed when Euron proposes to Cersei, but is relieved when she refuses his proposal.{{Ref|GOT701}}

[[File:702 Randyll and Jaime.png|thumb|Jaime persuades Randyll of Olenna's dishonor.]]
Jaime is present when Cersei convenes a court of [[Reach]]men, including [[Randyll Tarly]], who are asked to betray their oaths to Olenna, who has recently joined forces with Daenerys. Jaime then manages to get Randyll on his own, after a brief confusion of names with his son [[Dickon Tarly|Dickon]], who is mistaken as "Rickard" to Jaime. He then makes it clear that Randyll is the most prominent of the lords of the Reach, and that the others will look to him when choosing sides. Despite Jaime mentioning the possibility of the [[Dothraki]] invading his lands, Randyll still announces that he doesn't wish to be dishonorable to Olenna. Jaime then promises to give him the title of [[Warden of the South]], should they succeed in triumphing over Daenerys.{{Ref|GOT702}}

[[File:Euron and Jaime.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Jaime and Euron converse over Cersei.]]
Jaime is present when Euron Greyjoy presents his captives of [[Yara Greyjoy]] and Ellaria and [[Tyene Sand]] as his promised gift to Cersei. As they stand beside the throne as Cersei proclaims Euron commander of her naval forces as well as assuring him of her hand in marriage once the war is won, Jaime quietly mutters that the same people who cheered for Euron would do the same if Cersei put his head on a spike. Euron ignores the jab, but responds with one of his own by asking Jaime for advice on how Cersei enjoys sex. A furious Jaime almost lunges at Euron, but Euron, delighted at having provoked him, gleefully tells Jaime to save it for later, in a not so public place.{{Ref|GOT703}}

Soon after, Jaime is seen dining in his chambers when Cersei enters the room, and proceeds to disrobe him. They have sex, and then the next morning, they are woken by a servant ringing the doorbell. Jaime urges Cersei to ignore it, and expresses shock when she decides to answer the door, as nobody should see him sleeping in Cersei's bed, but Cersei retorts that she is the Queen and can do whatever she wants. When Cersei opens the door, the servant tells her that the representative from the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]] is ready to meet with her, and her eyes catch on to the sight of Jaime in Cersei's bed, before quickly walking away. Cersei smiles as Jaime's concern turns to amusement.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:Lannister army reaches Highgarden s7.JPG|thumb|180x180px|Jaime prepares to sack Highgarden.]]
Jaime is next seen leading the combined Lannister-Tarly army, along with Bronn, Randyll Tarly and Dickon in the final assault against Highgarden. In the aftermath of the assault and the massacre of the castle's Tyrell garrison, passing through his own soldiers counting up the spoils of victory, Jaime confronts Olenna in her study. Jaime notes that the Tyrell forces fought bravely, whereupon Olenna acknowledges warfare was not [[House Tyrell]]'s strong point. Olenna observes that Tyrion and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] thought the bulk of the Lannister forces would be defending Casterly Rock against the [[Unsullied]] attack. Jaime, while pouring two glasses of wine, reveals it was a ruse, explaining that his ancestral home is now practically worthless, aside from childhood sentiment; a token garrison was left behind and the Rock's food stores were emptied before they fled. He also states Euron's [[Iron Fleet]] will have destroyed the attacking fleet, leaving the Unsullied trapped deep in Westeros at the mercy of Lannister forces. Meanwhile, the main Lannister army would be far away from the main attack, a strategic move Jaime learnt from Robb in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]]. Olenna wonders why Tywin didn't just take Highgarden when Casterly Rock's mines first ran out of gold. Knowing her end is near, she remarks that she may ask Tywin himself soon enough.{{Ref|GOT703}}

Olenna asks Jaime how he intends to kill her, speculating he will kill her with Widow's Wail, Joffrey's old sword. Remarking on Joffrey's horrible nature, Olenna proudly admits that she enacted measures to protect her family at all costs, with no regrets, but reflects that her actions pale in comparison to the atrocities performed by Cersei. She tells Jaime that Cersei is a monster; a matter of opinion according to Jaime. While some may dread her, Jaime insists that none will care what she has done, so long as order is restored. Olenna observes that Jaime really does love his sister, and calls him a fool, claiming that she will be the end of him, and that by the time he realizes what a disease Cersei is, it will be far too late for him. Jaime considers this a moot point, of little value discussing with Olenna, although she points out that as an experienced person about to die, she is the perfect person to discuss his life with.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:Jaime-Olenna-the-end.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Olenna tells Jaime of her role in Joffrey's murder.]]
Olenna again asks Jaime how he plans to kill her. Jaime tells her of Cersei’s idea of having her whipped and beheaded, or flayed alive and hanged, but he talked her out of those ideas. He then produces a small phial and empties its contents into one of the glasses of wine, giving it to Olenna who then drinks it after Jaime confirms that it will be a painless death. Olenna reflects on the horrible way that Joffrey died, and the gruesome details that the poison caused; she admits that part was unintentional on her part, as she had never seen the [[strangler]] work in person before. Shocked into silence, Jaime stares at her, realizing at last who really killed his eldest son and let his brother take the blame, setting in motion the deaths of Oberyn, Tywin, and Myrcella. Satisfied at his horror, Olenna insists that he tell Cersei that she was the one who murdered her son, whereafter a furious Jaime storms out, leaving Olenna to die.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:704 Jaime Lannister Highgarden Spoils of War.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Jaime seizes the Tyrell gold.]]
Later, Jaime coordinates the soldiers loading up the spoils of war for transport after the [[sack of Highgarden]] allowed them to seize all of House Tyrell's substantial gold stores, which they send ahead to King's Landing first, before moving on to securing grain shipments. Jaime procures [[Money|a large bag of gold coins]] and gives it to Bronn as payment for his services. Bronn, however, is annoyed that this isn't the full reward he was promised, which included a wife from the nobility and a castle. He then half-seriously asks why Jaime doesn't just grant him [[Highgarden]], as they need someone to rule it. Jaime waves this aside by saying they don't actually intend to hold Highgarden for long as it would be difficult for Bronn of all people to rule over hostile territory, and the war isn't over yet, so at this point he thinks Bronn should be satisfied with a more movable big sack of gold than a castle he'll have trouble defending. Bronn, however, is not amused.{{Ref|GOT704}}

Some time later, Jaime's Lannister army has advanced much farther east along the [[Goldroad]], in the northeast of the [[Reach]]. Randyll Tarly comes to Jaime and says they should hurry to get all of their grain wagons over the [[Blackwater Rush]] to King's Landing on the northern side, as they will be vulnerable if their formation is caught on both sides of the river. Jaime agrees, but Randyll suggests flogging the stragglers to motivate them. Jaime urges that his soldiers fought well at Highgarden, however, and he should at least give them a fair ''warning'' first instead of launching right into the flogging. Jaime and Bronn then encounter Dickon again. Jaime asks what he thought of his first taste of battle, and Dickon nervously claims it was glorious - only to then dejectedly admit that he was quite conflicted: [[House Tarly]] had been loyal vassals of the Tyrells for generations; he knew many of the men they killed, even hunted side by side with them. Jaime earnestly advises the young man that the guilt is not his but Olenna's as she was the one who chose to side with Daenerys's foreign army against Queen Cersei, so it is truly Olenna's fault they died and the fact that Dickon wasn't involved with the decision making process on either side means he shouldn't dwell on it. Dickon then outright confesses that the aftermath was horrible, notably the smell of all the fresh corpses. Bronn playfully taunts that Dickon, a sheltered nobleman, finally found out that men void their bowels when they die.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:Jaime-Bronn-Spoils-of-War.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Jaime and Bronn spot the Dothraki horde.]] 
Upon reaching the Goldroad by the Blackwater river, Jaime and Bronn are surprised to hear what sounds like distant thunder, until they realize it must be approaching cavalry. Jaime and Randyll shout for their soldiers to form up, which they manage to do before the enemy crests over the horizon - a massive, 100,000 strong horde of [[Dothraki]] cavalry. Bronn insists that Jaime should just leave and ride ahead to King's Landing, but Jaime insists he will not abandon his men. Bronn bluntly tells him the Dothraki will swamp the Lannister lines and Jaime is too valuable as a commander to stay and fight, but Jaime insists that they have a chance if they hold.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:704 Battle of Tumbleton 3.png|thumb|180x180px|Jaime spots Daenerys Targaryen and her dragon Drogon.]]
At that moment, they hear a roar not heard on the battlefields of Westeros in over a century and a half, and look above the Dothraki horde to see a huge adult [[dragon]] heading straight for their lines - [[Drogon]], ridden by Daenerys herself. Drogon outpaces the Dothraki, and at Daenerys's command "''Dracarys''," he blasts a torrent of fire through the Lannister ranks in a straight line from front to back, punching a hole in their formation. The highly mobile Dothraki light cavalry immediately sweep through it and wheel around to catch those parts of the Lannister lines in an envelopment.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:704 Battle of Tumbleton 7.png|thumb|Jaime and Bronn lead the Lannister-Tarly forces.]]
The Lannister-Tarly lines around Jaime and Randyll manage to rally under their leadership, however: the Dothraki charge into the Lannister lines head-on, but meet stiff resistance as their spear wall holds firm. Though they are outnumbered, the Lannister soldiers are better armed heavy infantry, highly disciplined and battle-hardened veterans from years of war. Dothraki horse-archers let off shots before charging into their ranks, but highly trained Tarly archers return fire, doing as much if not more damage as the Dothraki wear less armor.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:704 Battle of Tumbleton 11.png|thumb|180x180px|Jaime witnesses Drogon in action.]]
The Lannister army gives as good as it takes for a time, but their enemy has the advantage of weight in numbers, and the tide turns slowly against them. For a moment it looks like Jaime might at least be able to force the Dothraki to a standstill - but then Daenerys wheels out of the air again, devastating the Lannister formations. No longer trying to punch vertical holes through their lines, she switches to flanking the Lannister ranks, burning a vast horizontal swath of men from left to right. Men are flash-burned into nothing but ash which crumbles upon the touch. Men are cooked alive in their own armor as they struggled to rip it off.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:Archers.jpg|thumb|Jaime rallies the Tarly archers.]]
Nonetheless, Jaime manages to rally his remaining forces a second time, desperately taking command of a group of surviving Lannister and Tarly archers and directing them to concentrate their fire at the dragon: Drogon might not be vulnerable to common arrow fire, but his rider is. If they can manage to kill Daenerys herself, who has risked appearing in open battle, the entire war could end in a day, no matter their losses. Daenerys sees the attack coming, however, and banks Drogon up so the arrow volley harmlessly bounces off the armored scales on his belly.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:Gold Road Loot Train Jaime59.jpg|thumb|Jaime watches his army burn.]]
He then blasts the archer formations with fire. Jaime avoids the flames and is surrounded by enemies, but he manages to carve a path through the Dothraki with his sword to try to reach safety. He nearly gets attacked by a Dothraki from behind at one point, but Dickon Tarly kills the Dothraki first, saving him. Even then all is not lost - Jaime also commanded Bronn to reach Qyburn's anti-dragon scorpion-bolt launcher, which they took with them in the wagon train for just this scenario (as Jaime cannot fire it one-handed). Bronn spots the dragon in the distance, and fires but misses. Daenerys is startled by the scorpion-bolt flying a few feet from her head, scans the battlefield, and spots Bronn on the scorpion as he reloads.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:704 Battle of Tumbleton 11.png|thumb|Jaime sees an opportunity when Drogon is wounded.]]
Bronn eventually manages to shoot Drogon in the shoulder, but the scorpion is destroyed immediately after by Drogon's dragonfire. To Jaime's disadvantage, the dragon's armored scales are so tough that the scorpion bolt only managed to cause superficial damage. Nonetheless the flesh wound grounds him, and he howls in pain and fury, destroying any masses of enemy soldiers that get near him. Daenerys sets him down and dismounts to try and pull the scorpion bolt out.[[File:Jaime Lance Charge TSOW.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Jaime charges at Daenerys.]]
Jaime, however, sees that Daenerys is grounded and immobilized, and realizes he still has one chance; if he can kill Daenerys, even now, he can end her invasion. Jaime grabs a spear and charges his horse across the flaming battlefield to make a death-run for Daenerys as she tends to her dragon. Tyrion, who is watching the battle from a safe distance along with the Dothraki commanders, swears under his breath, calling his brother a "fucking idiot", angry that he's going to get himself killed. Just as Jaime is nearly on top of Daenerys, however, Drogon notices him amidst the chaos of the battle; shielding Daenerys behind his head, the dragon lets out a blast of flame, but Bronn rushes over to tackle Jaime out of the way, saving him from certain death.{{Ref|GOT704}}

[[File:Bronn_saves_jaime_Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|Bronn rescues Jaime from drowning in his armor.]]
They both fall into the river, where Jaime is weighed down by his armor, and sinks beneath the waters, in danger of drowning.{{Ref|GOT704}} Jaime is pulled ashore by Bronn, who rebukes him for making such a reckless gamble. Realizing there is no chance their armies can beat Daenerys at war, especially if she makes use of all three dragons, Jaime knows he must tell Cersei the bad news, to which Bronn suggests it may be better if he jumped back into the water.{{Ref|GOT705}}

[[File:705 Jaime.jpg|thumb|Jaime returns to King's Landing.]]
When he arrives back at King's Landing, he brings the news of their defeat, and that fighting Daenerys is suicide, only to be rebuffed by Cersei's overconfidence in the Iron Bank and the [[Golden Company|mercenaries]] that can be hired with the ransacked gold of Highgarden. As promised, he also tells Cersei it was Olenna who had murdered Joffrey, to her initial disbelief; however, as Jaime talks her through it, pointing out that Olenna had far more to gain from killing Joffrey than Tyrion, Cersei is forced to concede he is telling the truth, and angrily berates Jaime for talking her into giving Olenna a merciful death. Jaime insists that House Lannister will follow House Tyrell into the grave if the war continues, but Cersei, to his dismay, makes it plain she intends to fight on to the bitter end, both of them knowing that Daenerys will do the same, and is more dangerous with the victory she has just achieved. Cersei surmises to say that she would rather fight and die, as she knows she will be killed even if she surrenders.{{Ref|GOT705}}

[[File:Tyrion and Jaime Eastwatch.jpg|thumb|Jaime meets with Tyrion.]]
Later, Bronn brings Jaime to the catacombs of the Red Keep for a secret training session, but Jaime finds Tyrion waiting for him. Though genuinely upset with his brother, Jaime agrees to hear him out, and Tyrion explains that Daenerys is requesting an armistice to defeat the White Walkers, before continuing the war at hand. Upon returning to his sister's chambers, Jaime relays this information to Cersei. After Cersei seemingly agrees to the ceasefire, she informs Jaime she is now pregnant with his child. A stunned Jaime asks who she will say the father is. Cersei simply responds, ''"You",'' and the two embrace in happiness.{{Ref|GOT705}}

[[File:707 Bronn Jaime Lannister.jpg|thumb|Bronn and Jaime discuss Daenerys's forces.]]
In preparation for the [[Dragonpit Summit|summit]], [[Grey Worm]] has the Unsullied lined up outside the city walls, watched by a nervous Jaime and Bronn. Jaime wonders how Bronn is unnerved by the idea of soldiers without genitalia, as he's been around enough soldiers to know why they fight, and that the idea of soldiers who fight for no promise of sex is alien to him. As they talk, hordes of Dothraki ride in, a stark contrast to the disciplined Unsullied; but the two ancient enemies are united in cause today. Jaime realizes that if this was an attack, they would lose.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:Game-of-thrones-the-dragon-and-the-wolf-620x360.jpg|thumb|Jaime accompanies Cersei to the parley.]]
Jaime later accompanies Cersei to the parley with Daenerys and Jon at the Dragonpit. He spots Brienne among the Northern assembly and the two stare at each other. Jaime quickly looks away from Brienne when he realizes that Cersei has noticed. When Euron Greyjoy attempts to derail the meeting and begins insulting Tyrion, Jaime angrily tells him to sit down. As the parley continues, proof of the Army of the Dead is shown, and Daenerys tells her story of how she saw them. Jaime asks her of the enemy numbers and he is shocked when she tells him of their overwhelming numerical superiority at around at least 100,000. When Cersei leaves the parley in outrage due to Jon's public pledge of loyalty to Daenerys, Brienne urges Jaime to convince Cersei to help. After trying and failing to do so, Jaime later wishes Tyrion luck when he arrives to do the same.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:7 epe 7 cersei finale.jpg|thumb|Cersei informs Jaime of her plot.]]
After Cersei relents, Jaime wastes no time assembling the commanders of the Lannister army in preparation for the march North. He is outraged when Cersei interrupts this meeting and reveals she lied about aiding the North in the war against the dead. Jaime angrily protests that the undead are a threat to every living thing, but Cersei dismisses his concerns, preferring to let Jon and Daenerys exhaust themselves against the Night King, then have her forces deal with whoever emerges victorious from that conflict, boasting that Euron will soon ferry the Golden Company to Westeros in order to secure the Lannister position. Jaime is beside himself with fury that Cersei and Euron plotted this behind his back, only to be left reeling when Cersei accuses him of plotting with Tyrion to advance the cause of their enemies.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:Jaime confronts Cersei s7 finale.png|thumb|180x180px|Jaime argues with Cersei after she reveals her intentions to betray the Starks and Targaryens.]]An incredulous Jaime tries to argue that this plan won't work. Either way somebody is going to win the war in the North. When that happens either an expanded Army of the Dead will march down in full force to claim the rest of Westeros or the victorious and united Targaryen/Northern alliance will come seeking retribution for Cersei's betrayal. After his protests fall on deaf ears, Jaime declares that he intends to travel North to honor his pledge. As he turns to leave, Ser Gregor blocks his path, causing Jaime to wonder if Cersei is actually going to have him executed. When Jaime uses Cersei's own words to remind her that their father and all their family members are dead (Tyrion having been disinherited), she assures him there is "one more yet to come."{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:Game-of-thrones-season-finale-stillsjaime.jpg|thumb|Jaime abandons Cersei to honor his pledge to the North.]]
Appalled at just how far Cersei will go to keep herself in power, Jaime nods to Clegane and tells his sister to give the order. After a moment's hesitation, she nods and Clegane draws his sword. However, since Cersei doesn't actually speak the words, a thoroughly disgusted Jaime calls her bluff. He storms out, leaving a saddened Cersei behind him. He abandons his Lannister armor for simpler garb and departs King's Landing alone. On the ride north, he pulls a riding glove over his golden hand and notices that it has begun to snow, indicating that winter has finally come to King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT707}}

{{Dialogue a-b-a|Jaime Lannister|By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?! |Brienne|Help! The Kingslayer!|Jaime. My name’s Jaime.|Jaime and Brienne|Kissed by Fire}}
At first glance, outsiders perceive Jaime to be arrogant, cocky, cold, dishonorable, extremely dangerous, disdainful, and sarcastic. To a large extent he is arrogant about his own abilities, but not without cause. Jaime was arguably one of the greatest swordsmen ever, but the loss of his sword-hand warped his abilities, which did much to humble him. Jaime does not mock others over minor insults the way Cersei does, and he can muster up polite behavior, but he is usually very blunt and straightforward. Much like Tyrion, he typically just says what he is thinking, and has no reservations about mocking those he perceives as incompetent. Despite this, there were men that Jaime admired (like Barristan Selmy, for whom he squired) and, underneath this cold and sarcastic attitude, Jaime is a very complicated man.

Tywin Lannister has raised Jaime and Cersei with the principle of ruthlessness as a virtue. Yet even though Jaime often behaves unapologetically amoral, in his own warped way, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family (Tywin and his three children) aside from Tyrion who shows any hint of honor or principles, whilst Tywin claims to see family as his highest priority but simultaneously is willing to have Tyrion, whom he views as an incalculable disgrace, killed, and Cersei herself ironically sees no immorality whatsoever in anything she does. This is largely based on his arrogance and pride at being a member of the Kingsguard. Jaime became extremely disillusioned with ideals of honor and loyalty when he saw firsthand the atrocities committed by the Mad King, how other "honorable" members of the Kingsguard stood by and did nothing while Aerys had people burned alive for imagined insults, because they felt bound by vows of faith and fealty - in this sense, Jaime is surprisingly similar to Sandor Clegane, since they both have powerful disillusionments about honor and nobility, yet they both frequently avoid unnecessary violence.

A key difference between Cersei and Jaime is that Cersei honestly believes, in her skewed view of the world, that she is "good", Joffrey is a great king, and all of her enemies are "evil" people trying to destroy her and her children. In contrast, Jaime does not maintain any pretense of being a "good" or honorable man, as he has become apathetic to such concerns - this was influenced by him being hated and loathed by everyone because he killed a man who had infamously terrorized the Seven Kingdoms, opening his eyes to how people perceive goodness and honor. However, he still has some respect for the rules of engagement, as he refused to kill Ned Stark when their duel ended abruptly, since Ned was incapacitated by an opportunistic guard rather than Jaime himself - Jaime personally punished that guard seconds after the duel ended. Jaime also was capable of treating his own enemies rather respectfully, telling Ned Stark that [[Rickard Stark|his father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]] didn't deserve to die the way Aerys killed them, and saved Olenna Tyrell from a crueler fate that Cersei would have inevitably given her, by allowing her to die painlessly.

Jaime was never politically ambitious, much to Cersei's annoyance, and often turns down her frequent urgings that he should try to become Hand of the King, stating that the days are too long and their lives are too short. Political maneuvering is not his way, and he sees himself foremost as a soldier who when confronted with a problem takes out his sword and cuts its head off. Up until the day his hand was cut off, he had immersed himself in combat so much that it is his sole value, and when he does lose his hand, his ''sword'' hand, he loses the will to live because, thus far, he has only ever had to decapitate a problem so as not to face it again, but now he cannot wield a sword the same way ever again - he laments that he ''was'' that hand. Brienne is quick to tirade to him about him having a small taste of a world where people have their good things ripped from their possession, and after that one small taste he gives up - she mistakes him for a coward at this point. Indeed, Jaime's lack of political thinking leads to him heatedly suggesting that either he or someone else execute the High Sparrow and his followers for manipulating Tommen - at the time, he did not quite see the long term ramifications of such an act because he was angry at the possibility of losing his only surviving child.

After losing his hand and confessing the real reason he killed Aerys to Brienne, Jaime begins to redevelop a sense of personal honor once again as he reevaluates his past and future. In no small part to Brienne's influence, Jaime begins to see his father for who he really is and begins to wonder if there are ideals worth fighting for. To this end, he outfits Brienne with new armor and even gifts her the Valyrian steel sword reforged from [[Ice]] so that Brienne can fulfill her oath to Catelyn. Jaime himself is more mindful of the promises he makes, and eventually tries offering his solemn oath in certain circumstances, treated with understandable skepticism by the likes of Edmure. Jaime's new outlook develops to the point where he is disgusted with Cersei for stabbing Daenerys's faction in the back, and announces his intention to keep his own promises (although the undead horror bearing down on the Seven Kingdoms clearly has something to do with it).

Jaime is the only member of Tyrion's immediate family who ever treated him with respect or kindness. In fact, he admires Tyrion's intellect and his ability to tell off those who insult him. Jaime never approved of Tywin and Cersei's long history of abuse towards Tyrion, and has always treated him like a brother, the only adult of Tyrion's immediate family to recognize how irrational it was to blame him for their mother's death in childbirth. Indeed, Jaime is the only member of the core Lannister family who has a reasonably good relationship with all of the others. Among the three siblings, Cersei and Tyrion can't stand each other, but they both like Jaime (both Cersei and Tyrion have acknowledged the only reason they haven't gone out of their way to seriously harm or kill each other is because Jaime would never forgive them if they did). However, in recent times, Jaime's good relationship with Tyrion was tarnished with the death of their father, and Jaime said he would kill Tyrion the next time they meet (though it is unclear if he really meant it). His relationship with Cersei has also deteriorated in the aftermath of Tywin's death since it was Jaime who set Tyrion free and inadvertently allowed him to kill their father.{{Ref|GOT501}} Over time, however, and especially after learning that it was Olenna who killed Joffrey, Jaime comes to accept that Tyrion effectively murdered Tywin out of self-defense, a man bound and determined to execute his son; when they meet again in King's Landing, Jaime is initially hostile towards Tyrion, but deep down understands his motives and listens to him, and by the time of the parley in the Dragonpit, Jaime treats Tyrion with the same respect as before, indicating that he has at least partially forgiven his brother. Over time it becomes clear that Jaime has fully forgiven his brother and shows him the same amount of love and respect as before. This can be seen in the brother's final goodbye where Tyrion tells his brother how much he has meant to him, bringing Jaime to tears as he embraces his little brother one last time.

Tywin was a stern man feared and resented by all of his children, ignoring Cersei for her gender and scorning Tyrion for both his stature and 'killing' his wife in childbirth. However, Jaime is on reasonably good terms with Tywin - not so much that he is "proud" of Jaime so much as he has the "least shame" for him compared to his brother and sister. Even so, Tywin is upset that Jaime willingly joined the Kingsguard, as while it is considered the highest honor for a knight, its members give up the rights to marry or inherit lands, meaning that Jaime cannot be Tywin's heir. Jaime wasn't in a position to act as a father to his biological children with Cersei, though he is generally supportive of Tommen and Myrcella. However, in sharp contrast with Cersei, Jaime isn't particularly fond of Joffrey, nor will he defend his actions the way Cersei does. He shows obvious joy when Myrcella reveals her knowledge that Jaime is her father and is happy about it, and embraces her, since this is the first time he has ever been able to show his feelings as a father to his children. He is equally saddened when Myrcella dies in his arms moments later. He also becomes enraged when the High Sparrow brainwashes his only son, and he contemplates a plan to bloodily finish the High Sparrow's schemes, even though sound judgment states that this plan wouldn't work.

Jaime's attitude towards violence is also complex: he threw Bran out a tower window to kill him, but later saved Brienne twice (from being raped, then fed to a bear) from Locke's soldiers. The difference seems to be that after witnessing the depravity of the Mad King, ''needless'' violence and brutality deeply offend Jaime, though if he decides that violence and murder are absolutely necessary he will ruthlessly carry it out himself. He threw Bran out of a window because had the boy reported that he saw the incest between Jaime and his sister, Cersei, the woman he loved, then all of their children would be executed, so he felt he had no choice. However, he was dreadfully sorry for crippling the boy and was amazed to learn that Bran was not angry at him. Jaime killed his defenseless cousin Alton Lannister in order to orchestrate an escape from Robb's camp, but he deeply regretted it afterwards, subtly hinting at it to Tyrion and then outright confessing to the High Sparrow about it, showing that he has a greater conscience than he is given credit for. This sets him apart from Cersei, who destroyed the Sept of Baelor and everyone inside (including their uncle and cousin) and around it, and proved unapologetic about what she had done. Jaime also was capable of reproach for the mistakes he made and their consequences, unlike Cersei: he felt guilt for freeing Tyrion because it led to the death of his father, whereas Cersei is blind to her own mistakes, which led to the deaths of her children. The upshot of this is that Jaime has no delusions about his own conscience. He is certainly ruthless when he needs to be, but unlike Cersei or Joffrey he does not act with cruelty for his own enjoyment. Quite the opposite, in fact: the very murder of Aerys that gained Jaime his negative reputation was actually an act of prevention against a potential genocide that would have engulfed all of King's Landing.

Although Jaime was a highly skilled warrior, he has never distinguished himself as a battle commander. He has won a couple of battles (a [[battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth]] and the [[Sack of Highgarden]]), and resolved the [[second siege of Riverrun]] almost without casualties; on the other hand, he was defeated in two major battles - [[Battle of Whispering Wood]] and [[Battle of the Goldroad]], in both cases his troops suffered heavy casualties, simply because he neglected basic precautions (placing sentries and sending scouts). Jaime has partly learned from his mistakes: remembering how Robb tricked him by leaving a small decoy force to be overwhelmed while the rest of the army moved to attack more important targets, Jaime allowed the Unsullied to take Casterly Rock (after having emptied its larders) while taking most of the Lannisters' forces south to storm Highgarden; he failed, however, to learn from the same battle the importance of precautions, and that led to his defeat at the Battle of the Goldroad. Regardless, Jaime quickly recognized that the only way he could turn the tide was by killing the enemy commander, even risking his own life for the sake of a chance to kill Daenerys; this demonstrates him to be a man of courage as well as military skill. 

Jaime seems to care about those beneath him, refusing to flog stragglers after the Sack of Highgarden, refusing to leave his men at the Battle of the Goldroad, and lamenting at how easily the Dothraki army broke his own army. Not only is Jaime a prodigal leader, but he has a good amount of common sense, as evidenced by his decision to ride north to combat the threat that the [[White Walkers]] posed to Westeros, and his utter incredulity at Cersei's refusal to contribute.

One defining trait of Jaime is his lack of fear of death; he once told Catelyn "the dark is coming for all of us" ("[[Fire and Blood]]"). Even when facing a nearly-certain and extremely agonizing death, he shows very little or no fear at all (like when Robb threatened to have Grey Wind kill him, or when he charged at Daenerys during the [[Battle of the Goldroad]] and was nearly burnt by Drogon). During his final moments, Jaime peacefully accepted death and used his final moments to comfort his distraught sister.

==In the books==
[[File:Roman Papsuev - Jaime Lannister.png|thumb|300px|right|Jaime Lannister by Roman "Amok" Papsuev.©]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jaime Lannister is described as extremely handsome with bright green eyes and hair like spun gold. The books do not mention him suffering from dyslexia. He is a prodigious warrior. From the point of his maiming, he is portrayed in the books much more positively than in the show.

Jaime becomes a POV character in the third novel. In the first two novels, his actions are witnessed and interpreted from the POV of other characters, mainly Eddard and Catelyn.

At the age of eleven, Jaime was sent to Crakehall, and served as a squire for old Lord Sumner Crakehall for four years (Jaime never served as a squire for [[Barristan Selmy]]). While on an errand for Crakehall, Jaime visited Riverrun and at dinner every night Hoster Tully seated him next to his daughter [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]]; Lords Tywin and Hoster were in talks to marry them. However, Jaime was more interested in talking to her famous uncle, Ser [[Brynden Tully]], a hero of his, and hearing of his exploits in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]].

Two years later, while still a squire, Jaime won his first tourney melee. When he was fifteen, he and his master accompanied Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Barristan Selmy in their campaign against the [[Kingswood Brotherhood]]. Jaime fought bravely against the Smiling Knight, although was not the one to kill him, and saved the life of Lord Crakehall from another of the outlaws. As a reward, Jaime was knighted by Arthur Dayne on the battlefield.

A Kingsguard berth became vacant with the death of Ser Harland Grandison. With Jaime's approval, Cersei schemed to have him chosen, to prevent his proposed marriage to Lysa Tully, and so they could be in the capital together. Jaime was duly appointed to the Kingsguard by King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. At fifteen, he was the youngest Kingsguard member in history. He served alongside such great and vaunted warriors as Lord Commander [[Gerold Hightower]], Barristan Selmy and Ser [[Arthur Dayne]], the legendary Sword of the Morning. Jaime's appointment extremely infuriated his father, as the Kingsguard take vows to serve for life, never marry, and give up the right to hold lands and titles. This meant Jaime was no longer his heir, the honor of which instead fell to Tywin's misshapen and hated youngest son, Tyrion, whose dwarfism made him unfit in his father's eyes to inherit Casterly Rock. It was the final straw in a long series of slights made against Tywin by the King. Soon afterwards he resigned as Hand of the King and returned to Casterly Rock, taking Cersei with him, thus unwittingly foiling her and Jaime's plan.

Very soon, Jaime realized - at the same day he became a member of the Kingsguard - that his appointment to the Kingsguard was not meant to honor him but to spite his father, whom Aerys was insanely jealous of, to deprive him of his heir and use him as a hostage for Tywin's good behavior, which greatly soured the honor; Aerys wouldn't even let Jaime to savor the day, but immediately ordered him to return to the capital and guard the queen and Viserys. Jaime rapidly became disillusioned with his new position, as he was forced to watch the various atrocities Aerys committed, forced by his vow to stand by and do nothing.

At the climax of [[Robert's Rebellion]], when the Lannister armies stormed [[King's Landing]], Aerys insisted - quite ironically, as Jaime muses many years afterwards - that Jaime stayed and guarded him, to make certain that Tywin would not act against him. Jaime protested, pleading Rhaegar to let Darry or Selmy guard the king, but Rhaegar refused to deprive his father of "that crutch" in such hour. Jaime was angered to be referred as "a crutch", but obeyed.

Jaime betrayed his king by murdering him at the foot of the [[Iron Throne]] itself. He attacked Aerys on the steps of the Iron Throne, and cut the Mad King's throat rather than stabbing him in the back as in the TV Series. Robert Baratheon forgave Jaime, reasoning that ''someone'' had to kill Aerys, and he was just happy that the Lannisters were the ones who got their hands dirty instead of himself. Eddard Stark, Stannis Baratheon and Barristan Selmy all believed that Jaime should have faced justice for killing Aerys, or at least stripped of his position on the Kingsguard and made to take the black, but Robert didn't want to upset his crucial alliance with Jaime's father Tywin, his own new father-in-law. Jaime is stuck in an ironic situation: Targaryen loyalists despise him for personally killing the last Targaryen king, but even those who joined Robert in rebellion (and wished Aerys dead) often question why he didn't kill Aerys ''sooner'', preventing the loss of life that happened in the war. A small number of people don't even mind what Jaime did or when he did it, but place so much respect on honor and justice that they feel his breach of his Kingsguard vows to defend the king are a sacrilege that can never be forgiven. For his part, Jaime points out that Aerys was a madman who roasted women and babies on spits because the voices in his head told him they were plotting against him, and he has no regrets about killing the Mad King.

Tywin's sister [[Genna Lannister|Genna]] remarks that Jaime isn't really like his father. Instead, she says Jaime has a combination of the qualities of Tywin's three younger brothers: Tygett's martial prowess, Gerion's sharp sense of humor, and Kevan's sense of honor. Genna insists that Tyrion is the son who inherited Tywin's brilliance and is most like his father, which she even told Tywin once, after which he didn't speak to her for six months.

The early sections of the book ''A Game of Thrones'' play to the suspicion that Jaime wants to seize the throne himself, but this is later shown to be a red herring. Also, Robert names him Warden of the East despite not being an Arryn or having any relation to the noble houses of the Vale.

After Jaime is captured in the battle in the Whispering Wood, he is held at Riverrun, not taken along with Robb's army, though Robb only leaves Riverrun some time later so he can consolidate his forces. No scenes between Jaime and Robb are depicted in the books (as neither is a POV character at this point), though it is entirely plausible that the scene with Robb in Jaime's cell in the Season 2 premiere could have happened in the books, just "off screen", as Robb doesn't immediately leave Riverrun. At first, Jaime is held in comfortable imprisonment in a tower of Riverrun, but after a failed escape attempt, in which he manages to kill two guards and seriously injure a third before being subdued, he is chained up in the dungeon.

The TV series' depiction of an escape attempt by Jaime, during which he kills Torrhen Karstark, is a very loose adaptation of events in the books. In the TV version, Jaime kills Torrhen because he was guarding his cell, which causes Lord Rickard Karstark to become enraged and demand revenge, to the point that Catelyn releases Jaime (in promise of her daughters' safe return from King's Landing) because she fears he won't live out the night. In the books, Jaime killed Rickard's sons Torrhen and Eddard Karstark at the battle in the Whispering Wood (Eddard Karstark's death is apparently unchanged in the TV version). While Lord Karstark was certainly upset in the books, he wasn't going to go disobey Robb's direct command as his liege-lord that Jaime must remain unharmed (at least because he thought they'd execute him eventually). Catelyn's decision to exchange Jaime as a prisoner isn't rushed by pressure from within the Stark camp, but is rather due to her grief at hearing the (false) report that Bran and Rickon have been killed by Theon at Winterfell. Furthermore, she had recently been told by Cleos Frey that he only saw Sansa when he visited King's Landing, which makes Catelyn wonder if Arya is dead too. Believing (somewhat justifiably) that even holding Jaime as prisoner is no guarantee that the crazed Joffrey won't have her daughters killed on a whim, Catelyn decides that keeping her remaining children safe is what matters most, so she releases Jaime, sending him under escort by Brienne to King's Landing. Rickard Karstark only truly becomes enraged ''after'' Catelyn releases Jaime, because he never thought they'd release the killer of his sons, as well as because it is a very poor exchange to trade a prominent Lannister warrior for two girls. The TV series may have moved Torrhen's death around to make it closer to Jaime's release, instead of just mentioning that Jaime killed Torrhen at the end of Season 1 and expecting the audience to remember this over a season later.

Similarly, "Alton Lannister" is actually a renamed version the character Cleos Frey in the books. Cleos's father is a Frey but his mother is a Lannister, and his name may have been changed because of concerns that the audience would be confused as the Freys are on Robb's side. Jaime does not kill him in the books (nor does he kill any of his kin), this is an invention of the TV series. Instead, Cleos is sent back to King's Landing again along with Brienne and Jaime, but is killed by outlaws along the way.

Jaime doesn't appear during virtually all of the second novel, ''A Clash of Kings'', emphasizing that he is a prisoner of the Starks and in isolation. He only appears near the end during one chapter when Catelyn Stark visits him in his cell to release him. Dialogue from this scene in the books was split in two, so that some of it is used in the scene where she releases him late in Season 2, while parts of it were moved back to a separate meeting between Catelyn and Jaime in the Season 1 finale (it was just one long meeting in the book). During their conversation in the book, Jaime bluntly admitted that he and Cersei are lovers; that he is the father of Cersei's kids; that he pushed Bran from the window. Jaime denied any connection to the [[catspaw]], and revealed to Catelyn that the dagger never belonged to Tyrion, who could not have lost it to Littlefinger when Jaime was unhorsed by [[Loras Tyrell]] (as Littlefinger claimed), because Tyrion always bet on Jaime. Catelyn realized that Jaime was telling her the truth. Jaime also told her in detail how [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] executed Ned's [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]]. Most of the conversation was omitted from the TV series.

The full oath that Catelyn forces Jaime (while he is drunk, chained to a wall, with a sword pressed to his chest) to swear is "''Swear that you will never again take up arms against Stark nor Tully. Swear that you will compel your brother to honor his pledge to return my daughters safe and unharmed. Swear on your honor as a knight, on your honor as a Lannister, on your honor as a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard. Swear it by your sister's life, and your father's, and your son's, by the old gods and the new, and I'll send you back to your sister. Refuse, and I will have your blood''." Jaime wonders why would Catelyn trust the word of someone who has broken so many vows in his life; he figures that she puts her trust in Tyrion. He decides that he would return Sansa, and Arya as well (if she could be found); it wouldn't win him back his lost honor, but the notion of keeping his word when everyone expects him ''not'' to - amuses him a lot.

Jaime then comes back to the forefront of the narrative in the third novel, ''A Storm of Swords'', even becoming a POV character, but while this can be done in a book, the TV series producers felt that it would be odd for one of the main cast members to disappear for an entire season (similarly, [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] doesn't appear that much in the second book either, so the TV show padded out her storyline in [[Qarth]]). This was partially made up for by showing more events that happened to Jaime "off screen", such as Robb interrogating him (in the season premiere) and actually depicting his failed escape attempt. Their primary solution, however, was to move ahead some of Jaime's storyline from the third book to late Season 2: Jaime is only released from captivity at the very end of the second book (as a cliffhanger), thus all of Jaime's scenes with Brienne leading him back to King's Landing are actually from the beginning of the third book. TV producers Benioff and Weiss insisted that they don't see each season as being required to neatly adapt each book matched to one season, but instead they are trying to adapt the story as a whole, so parts from other books will spill into other seasons as they are required, i.e. pointing out that the Jaime/Brienne scenes in late Season 2 aren't fabrications of the TV series, just moving up some scenes that actually occurred in the next book.

In "Kissed by Fire" Jaime reveals his motivation for assassinating the Mad King to Brienne. In corresponding book scene, Jaime also says that he didn't tell Ned Stark his version of what happened because he knew Lord Stark wouldn't believe him anyway (and even if Ned believed - it wouldn't make any difference because the only thing mattered to Ned was that Jaime acted dishonorably regardless of the reason that made him kill Aerys), but he also goes on to explain to Brienne that the Kingsguard are sworn to keep the king's secrets, and he didn't want to be seen as breaking even more of his vows to King Aerys, even after his death. When Brienne calls for help for the Kingslayer, Jaime merely thinks to himself "Jaime. My name is Jaime.", instead of saying it out loud (though Bryan Cogman explained that Jaime is losing consciousness and just whimpering this to himself, not to Brienne).

Jaime and Brienne do not return to King's Landing in time for [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's wedding]]. They are still en route back to the capital when they learn of Joffrey's death. Jaime is not particularly upset by the news and reflects that Joffrey was little more to him than "a squirt of seed", and that he deserved to die. At Cersei's insistence, he had kept his distance from their children and never grew too close to them, so as not to arouse suspicion about their true paternity. He decides that, if he had the choice, he would rather have his sword hand than his son back, since he and Cersei can always make another son.

Since Sansa has already escaped by the time he returns to King's Landing (unlike in the show), and Arya is long gone, maybe dead, Jaime is unable to fulfill the second part of his oath to Catelyn. Still, he tries to fulfill it by arming and equipping Brienne as best as he can, including the fine sword Oathkeeper, for the perilous search she intends to conduct.

Jaime has always been his father's favorite child (since Jaime disappointed him the least of all his children) - as long as he obeyed his father. This changes in the third novel; after Jaime returns to King's Landing, he severs his relationship with the two people who always had negative influence on him - his father first: Tywin demands that Jaime quit the Kingsguard and take his place as the heir of Casterly Rock. Jaime, sick and tired of the corruption, injustice and political manipulations around him, refuses to be his father's puppet anymore and exclaims in rage "I am a knight of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard! And that's all I mean to be!." Tywin, furious at Jaime's defiance, answers harshly "''You are not my son''" (almost the same words he told Tyrion, after the latter shot him). This is their last conversation in the books. Kevan tries to make peace between them, but in vain.

Jaime gradually grows distant from Cersei too: he refuses her demand to kill Tyrion, since he believes Tyrion is innocent, and Joffrey meant nothing to him. Cersei teases him "Was it your hand they hacked off in Harrenhal, or your manhood?." She feels he has changed (which he did, as a result of Brienne's positive influence and his maiming), and does not like that.

One of the things that bother Jaime most of all is how low the Kingsguard has fallen; he compares in his mind the current Kingsguard members to those who served with him during the Mad King's reign, and is filled with disgust and disdain. Jaime is determined to exercise his authority as the Lord Commander in order to reform the organization. For that purpose, he interviews the Kingsguard members, puts each of them in his place, and makes it very clear that from now on they will not blindly obey the king, and that deeds like Sansa's beating are unacceptable. 

When Jaime releases Tyrion from his cell on the eve of his execution for killing Joffrey, it is the first time the brothers have spoken since they were at [[Winterfell]] together. Jaime confesses that he is saving his younger brother partly out of guilt. He reveals that [[Tysha]], Tyrion's first wife, was not a whore. Jaime did not pay her to sleep with Tyrion and he did not arrange for he and Tyrion to rescue her from a gang of rapists. She was in fact all that she appeared to be, a humble crofter's daughter whom they only met by chance on the road. Jaime says their father forced him to tell Tyrion that she was a whore to teach him a lesson. Enraged by this revelation, Tyrion slaps Jaime so hard it knocks him backwards. Out of spite (or perhaps in order to hurt Jaime), he lies that he really did kill Joffrey, and also reveals to Jaime that Cersei has been sleeping with [[Lancel Lannister]] and [[Osmund Kettleblack]] (in reality Osney Kettleblack), and maybe others. Tyrion leaves, vowing to return and take revenge on his family.

Tyrion's claim that Cersei has been unfaithful to him leads to Jaime growing increasingly disenchanted with his sister. While he initially thinks it was just a spiteful lie intended to hurt him, he is tormented by the thought, and eventually comes to realize that Tyrion was telling the truth (Lancel confesses to Jaime that he slept with Cersei).

After Tywin's death, Cersei asks Jaime to be the new Hand of the King, but he flatly refuses, having no interest in politics. He is also put off by Cersei's heavy drinking (which leads to her putting on weight), and her paranoia and vindictive scheming, which he warns her are creating enemies where there are none, as well as alienating the few allies she has left. She ignores his advice to appoint experienced men like [[Kevan Lannister]], [[Randyll Tarly]] and [[Paxter Redwyne]] to her small council, rather than the lickspittles and fools she now surrounds herself with. When Cersei, now a prisoner of the [[Faith Militant]], writes to Jaime pleading for him to return at once to be her champion in her upcoming trial, he does not reply and orders the letter burnt.

To help improve his left-handed swordsmanship, Jaime first enlists his old friend Ser [[Addam Marbrand]] to spar with him. Fearing that Ser Addam could get drunk and let slip the truth about his diminished skills, Jaime then turns to Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], reasoning that, being unable to speak or write, Payne is not likely to tell anyone. He never trains with [[Bronn]], as portrayed in the TV series. Jaime practices diligently, determined to regain his fighting skills, but his progress is very slow. After every practice, he and Ilyn sit and drink together. Jaime finds Ilyn the perfect drinking companion, for he never interrupts Jaime, never disagrees, never complains or asking for favors or tells long pointless stories. Jaime feels comfortable to chat with Ilyn that he reveals to him his darkest secrets, like the time he nearly killed Arya at Cersei's request, as a payback for the injuries [[Nymeria (direwolf)|her direwolf]] inflicted on Joffrey.

One day, Jaime sits in the [[White Sword Tower]], reading the ''[[Book of Brothers]]''. He does a soul-searching, feeling deep regret for his vile deeds, trying to remember in what stage of his life he has gone astray "''Me, that boy I was... when did he die, I wonder? When I donned the white cloak? When I opened Aerys's throat? That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead''."

Throughout the first half of the fourth novel, Jaime does nothing in particular, except showing at formal events and watching how poorly his sister rules and treats Tommen. He does not bother to attend the meetings of the small council, though he has the right to attend as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, because he finds them boring, and because he can't stand the company of Qyburn and Cersei's other cronies that comprise the small council. He grows to loathe his sister, now that he sees her as she really is - vile, treacherous and promiscuous. When he is assigned to go to Riverrun, he is glad to leave the city, feeling more comfortable amongst soldiers in the field than at the court. 

Jaime does not travel to Dorne to rescue Myrcella from any danger. Cersei instead sends him to the Riverlands to end the [[Second siege of Riverrun|siege]] and persuade Brynden Tully to surrender Riverrun to the Frey garrison in exchange for Edmure Tully's safety, while Ser [[Balon Swann]] is sent to Dorne to bring Myrcella (and also to play his part in Cersei's failed scheme to assassinate Trystane Martell). Jaime is still in the Riverlands when Ser Balon reports to Kevan about the attempt on Myrcella, who survived but was horribly disfigured, thus he has no idea what happened to her by the point the books reached.

Jaime is never dismissed from the Kingsguard. He obeys the command to travel to Riverrun, but intends to keep the first part of his oath to Catelyn - to resolve the siege without spilling blood, and he succeeds: Riverrun yields, and none of the participants, besiegers and besieged alike, is harmed. Although the Blackfish escapes, Jaime is content for preventing bloodshed.

On the way to Riverrun, Jaime stops at Darry, where Lancel confesses tearfully to him about his part in [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|Robert's death]] and his affair with Cersei. That confession clears any doubts Jaime had about his sister; moreover, it makes him realize she is responsible for the murders of Robert and the previous High Septon.

As a part of Jaime's redemption, after resolving the siege of Riverrun he gives a lot of thought about his surviving children. He wants to be a father figure to Tommen, to have him raised properly, to protect him from Cersei's negative influence before she can turn him to another Joffrey. He believes Kevan is the best choice for Tommen's Hand. He also considers revealing to Tommen and Myrcella that the rumors spread by Stannis about their origin are true, but is unsure whether it is a good idea: confirming that they are not Robert's offspring will cost Tommen his throne, and may cost Myrcella her betrothal to Trystane Martell.

Following Cersei's arrest (which takes place while Jaime is away), she sends him a letter, pleading to be her champion at her trial. Jaime knows that even if he goes back, he cannot hope to save her: he is certain that she is guilty of all the crimes she is charged with (among them incest, adultery, regicide, and deicide), and he is short a sword hand. He tells his squire to burn the letter - either to destroy any evidence of their incest, or perhaps as a symbolic gesture of severing their relationship permanently.{{Bookref|AFFC|44}}

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', from Riverrun Jaime continues to [[Raventree Hall]], the last stronghold at the Riverlands that has not yielded yet to the crown. He persuades Lord Tytos Blackwood to surrender non-violently.{{Bookref|ADWD|48}}

Unbeknownst to Jaime, Brienne and her companions Pod and Ser Hyle Hunt have been taken captive by the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], now led by the monstrous Lady Stoneheart (the reanimated [[Catelyn Stark]]). Lady Stoneheart incorrectly believes that Jaime was involved in the Red Wedding, and gives Brienne a choice: "Take the sword and slay the Kingslayer, or be hanged for a betrayer." Brienne refuses to make the choice; Lady Stoneheart commands to hang the three of them. As the ropes tighten, Brienne screams a word in order to save her companions.{{Bookref|AFFC|42}}

On his way back to the capital, Jaime meets Brienne at [[Pennytree]]. Jaime is stunned to see her facial injuries ([[Biter]]'s handiwork). She tells him that she found Sansa, and "I can take you to her, ser... but you will need to come alone. Elsewise, [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] will kill her." It is obvious (to the readers) that Brienne is lying, since Sansa is in the Vale, and the Hound's fate is unknown. It seems Brienne intends to lead Jaime into a trap; the chapter ends with a cliffhanger.{{Bookref|ADWD|48}}
