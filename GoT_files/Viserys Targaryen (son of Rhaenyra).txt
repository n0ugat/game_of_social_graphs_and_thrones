{{Quote|Ah... Viserys. Now that is a name fit for a king.|Viserys I Targaryen|The Lord of the Tides}}
Prince '''Viserys Targaryen'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Viserys Targārien''}} is a [[prince]] of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Viserys is the fourth child and second son of [[Daemon Targaryen]], and fifth child of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. He is named after his grandfather and uncle, [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Viserys I Targaryen]]. He is presently fifth in the line of succession to succeed to the Iron Throne, behind his three older half-brothers ([[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]], [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] and [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]]), and his older brother [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]], though this position is disputed by the [[Greens]].

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
As a young child Viserys travels with his family to [[King's Landing]] to defend the succession rights of his half-brother [[Lucerys Velaryon]] to [[Driftmark]]. He and his older brother Aegon are introduced to their grandfather/uncle, the ailing King Viserys I Targaryen. Upon learning of the boy's name, Viserys I is overjoyed at him having been named after himself and jokes that it is a name "fit for a king."{{Ref|HOTD108}}

After his uncle [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] [[Coup in King's Landing|usurps]] the throne, his [[Hand of the King|Hand]], Ser [[Otto Hightower]], delivers terms to Rhaenyra, which include Viserys having a high place at court as the King's [[cupbearer]]. Daemon, and later Rhaenyra, furiously reject this.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Rhaenyra plays with him and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]] in her chambers. Following the attempted [[Duel on Dragonstone|assassination]] on her, she decides to sends him, Aegon, [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]], and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] to the [[Eyrie]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}

At the castle of Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]], Viserys plays with toys with his big brother while [[Stormcloud]] watches them. Lady Jeyne arrives to tell Rhaena that the [[Reggio Haratis]] has agreed to take her and her siblings, and that the ''[[Gay Abandon]]'' will take them there.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Viserys leaves the Eyrie with Aegon and Joffrey.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Viserys was born in 122 AC at [[Dragonstone]]. He had silver-gold hair and was frailer than his brother Aegon. A [[dragon]] egg was placed in his cradle shortly after his birth, in accordance with Targaryen tradition. He and his siblings lived on Dragonstone away from the royal court.
