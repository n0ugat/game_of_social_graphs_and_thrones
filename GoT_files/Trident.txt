The '''Trident'''{{Ref|H&L114}} is one of the largest and most well-known rivers on the continent of [[Westeros]]. Technically it is three rivers which flow into one another just before they reach the [[Narrow Sea]], several hundred miles north of [[King's Landing]].
The Trident is the most extensive river network on the continent of Westeros. It flows out of the hills and low mountains of the eastern [[Westerlands]] and the bogs of the Neck into the Narrow Sea. It consists of three major branches, from south to north: the [[Red Fork]], the [[Blue Fork]], and the [[Green Fork]]. The three main rivers of the Trident and their numerous smaller tributaries give the [[Riverlands]] their name.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Trident is the same. The Tumblestone is a tributary of the Red Fork that flows from the north out of the Westerlands and joins the Red Fork coming up from the south at Riverrun. For much of its length, the Red Fork is meandering and slow moving, with frequent sandbars and islets. There are fords a few miles south of Riverrun and another ford known as the Mummer's Ford, farther east.

The books haven't made clear what the proper name of the river is for the brief part of its run east of where all three forks merge, to the point where it enters the ocean. It may be known simply as "the Trident" at this point, but as with several rivers in real life, one of the three branches may be considered the main river, i.e. how the Ohio River is a tributary of the Mississippi River, but the waters below where they join are considered to be "the Mississippi" and not a new river. Such nomenclature is often based on local factors, i.e. the riverbed of the lower Mississippi more closely matches the riverbed of the upper Mississippi than the river bed of the Ohio, etc. It's possible, due to vague references that the Battle of the Trident at Ruby Ford was fought "on the Green Fork of the Trident", that the Green Fork of the Trident is considered to be the one which flows all the way to the ocean.

The headlands of the Green Fork are allegedly close to the location of the mysterious Greywater Watch, the seat of House Reed.
