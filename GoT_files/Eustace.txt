'''Eustace''' is a [[septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]], based in [[King's Landing]].

==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:TGC Aegon II Coronation Still.jpg|thumb|Coronation of Aegon II.]]
Septon Eustace takes part in the coronation of King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] at the [[Dragonpit]], praying to the [[Seven]] for their blessing and anointing Aegon with sacred oils.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Eustace is one of three major sources cited by Archmaester Gyldayn for the history of the Dance of the Dragons. Maester [[Yandel]] considers Eustace's account to be more reliable than that of Mushroom. It is said that Eustace disliked [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. Eustace's account, while generally accurate, tends to be biased against Rhaenyra and to favor Alicent and Aegon II, in contrast with [[Munkun]]'s history (based on [[Orwyle]]'s account) which is said to be biased in favor of Rhaenyra and against Aegon II. Despite being biased in favor of the Greens, Eustace's account is the one least favorable to [[Criston Cole]] (Eustace's account is the one that accuses Cole of wanting to break his [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] vows to elope with Rhaenyra, and of slitting Lord [[Lyman Beesbury]]'s throat when Lyman protested the Greens usurping Rhaenyra).

Eustace was born in [[Stoney Sept]], a walled town in the [[riverlands]]. He would later come to serve in the [[Red Keep]]'s castle sept during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen]].

Eustace anointed King Aegon II himself because the [[High Septon]] was too old and frail to travel from [[Oldtown]] to [[King's Landing]].
