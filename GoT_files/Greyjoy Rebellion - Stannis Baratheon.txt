==Narration==
'''Stannis Baratheon''': ''Though [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] had risked all our lives to win it, the [[Iron Throne]] bored him.''

''He cared little for justice and less for rule. If it weren't women or wineskin, he had no use for it.''

''Without the stalwart [[Jon Arryn]] as [[Hand of the King]], the challenge to Robert's crown would have come much earlier than it did.''

''The [[Iron Islands]] have never lacked for treachery. They respect only strength, and honor is as foreign to them as the [[Seven]].''

''After six years, their ruler, Lord [[Balon Greyjoy]], wagered that King Robert had not won the support of the Great Houses of [[Westeros]], many of whom still named him "Usurper."''

''Lord Balon declared the Iron Islands independent and sent his [[Iron Fleet]] to [[Lannisport]].''

''Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] was careless, and the [[Ironborn]] [[Raid on Lannisport|burnt]] his ships at anchor. Lord Balon and his reavers controlled the [[Sunset Sea]].''

''Robert then ordered [[Stannis Baratheon|me]] to succeed where his father-in-law, Lord Tywin, had failed.''

''Beneath Robert's fury, I sensed relief. War, he could understand. He would smash Lord Balon as he had [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]. I raised Robert's fleet and sailed around [[Westeros]] to the Iron Islands.''

''I set a [[Sea battle off Fair Isle|trap]] for the [[Iron Fleet]] off [[Fair Isle]]. As sailors and warriors, the Ironborn are unparalleled, but they are not soldiers. They have no discipline, no strategy, no unity. In a battle, each man fights only for his own glory, and their longships are built for lightning strikes and shore raids.''

''When the captains rushed in, I smashed their longships with our larger war galleys.''

''The strength of the Ironborn is in their ships. With the Iron Fleet broken, I had assured Robert's victory. He could now transport troops and siege weapons to invade the Iron Islands, and contrary to Balon's hopes, Robert had plenty of both.''

''I've never seen such allegiances Robert could inspire in war. Enemies who tried to kill him one day would be drinking with him the next under their own fallen banners.''

''In rebelling against the Iron Throne, Lord Balon did more than Robert ever could to cement his rule.''

''When Robert came to the Iron Islands, he brought with him the full power of Westeros. Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] of the [[Kingsguard]] led the [[assault on Old Wyk]] while I [[Capture of Great Wyk|subdued]] [[Great Wyk]], the largest of the Iron Islands.''

''But Robert saved the seat of [[House Greyjoy]], [[Pyke]], for himself and Lord [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]].''

''Robert would later boast of the battle's bloodiness and how he could have torn down the island into the waves if Lord Balon had not bent the knee. But if I had led the assault, Balon's neck would have bent under a sword.''

''Because I do not forget or pardon. His time will come. [[Joffrey Baratheon|All]] [[Renly Baratheon|their]] [[Robb Stark|times]] will come.''

==Behind the scenes==
*This is the third of four shorts on the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
*In the main live-action TV series, characters have repeatedly stated that the Greyjoy Rebellion occurred nine years before Season 1 - just as it occurred nine years before the first novel. In this short, Stannis says that Balon launched his rebellion six years after Robert's Rebellion - that was true in the novels, but the TV continuity pushed back the beginning of Robert's Rebellion, to make it seventeen years before the start of the narrative, not fifteen years as in the books (9 + 6 = 15). This line is therefore in error, and Stannis should have said he waited ''eight'' years.
