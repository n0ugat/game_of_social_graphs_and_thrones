{{Quote|It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes... Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. [[Magister]]s sold their palaces. [[Khal]]s burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.|[[Doreah]]|The Kingsroad}}
