{{Quote|Lyonel Baratheon, black of hair.|Excerpt from ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''|A Golden Crown}}
Ser '''Lyonel Baratheon''',{{Ref|GOT106}} called '''The Laughing Storm''',<ref name="GRRMegg" /> is the heir to [[Storm's End]] during the reign of [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]].

==In the books==
In the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], Lyonel Baratheon is a very tall man, known as the "Laughing Storm" for his tendency to laugh loudly at his opponents during tourneys, at which he is greatly favored by the [[smallfolk]]. He is considered one of the finest fighters of his day.

While their exact relationship has not yet been confirmed in the books, Lyonel is quite probably the great-grandfather of [[Robert Baratheon]] (and his brothers [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]). Robert's father Steffon was the son of Ormund Baratheon, but while Ormund is of the right age to be Lyonel's son it hasn't been specified yet (i.e. it's possible Ormund was Lyonel's nephew).
