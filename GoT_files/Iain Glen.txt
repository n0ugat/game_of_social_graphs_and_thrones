{{Quote|I could see from the outline that if I was going to play Jorah, I would be in it for the long haul. His journey is slow burn through the course of many seasons. Such roles afford the opportunity to develop character more roundly, more like real life I guess, where personality reveals itself over time... It felt like a luxury not to have to show too much too quickly.|Iain Glen on playing Jorah Mormont|Inside HBO's Game of Thrones}}
