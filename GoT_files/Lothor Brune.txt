'''Lothor Brune''' is a [[Mercenary#Freeriders|freerider]], formerly in the service of Lord [[Petyr Baelish]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Lothor Brune participates in the [[Tournament|tourney]] of King [[Joffrey Baratheon]]'s sixteenth [[nameday]]. He is set to duel Ser [[Dontos Hollard]], but the fight is forfeited when Ser Dontos appears drunk.{{Ref|GOT201}}

==In the books==
In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', Lothor Brune is a relative of [[House Brune]] of Brownhollow. He is a quiet, loyal man of middle age described as having has a squashed nose, a square jaw and grey hair. He is stocky and strong, and while not a handsome man he is not ugly either. In the books he was also present at the Tourney of the Hand, defeating [[Jory Cassel]] on a judgment by the [[Robert Baratheon|King]], tied with Ser [[Aron Santagar]] and lost to Ser [[Robar Royce]]. He tips off [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] about [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]]'s request to spare Ser [[Dontos Hollard|Dontos]] at King Joffrey's 13th nameday. He also takes part in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and is awarded with a [[knighthood]] afterwards, earning the nickname "Apple-Eater" for capturing a knight of [[House Fossoway]] and killing two more on the battlefield.

When Ser Dontos spirits Sansa out of [[King's Landing]] after the [[Purple Wedding]], Lothor is present on Petyr's ship, and commanded the team of crossbowmen that kill Dontos Hollard at Littlefinger's order (coincidentally, the same man Lothor was supposed to face at Joffrey's tournament). Lothor throws a burning torch on the rowing boat after Dontos is murdered, ensuring that his body is never recovered. He accompanies Littlefinger to [[Baelish keep|his keep]] at the [[Fingers]] and later to the [[Eyrie]].

In the books, Joffrey's nameday tournament in which Dontos and Lothor are set to fight is held between men fighting on horseback. Possibly due to budgetary and time constraints, in the TV series they are preparing to fight on foot. This makes it somewhat of a misnomer that Lothar is specifically introduced as a "freerider" but he isn't fighting on horse.

While Sansa stays at the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], she notices Lothor is fond of Mya Stone, [[Robert Baratheon]]'s eldest bastard (omitted from the TV series). She thinks Lothor would be a good match for Mya. Lothor also prevents [[Marillion#In the books|Marillion]] from raping Sansa.
