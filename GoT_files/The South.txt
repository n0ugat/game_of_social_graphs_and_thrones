==Narration==
'''Tormund''': ''For thousands of years, when [[Free Folk|my people]] looked south, they saw only a [[Wall|wall of ice]] where lonely [[Night's Watch|crows]] perched. The [[kneelers]] had stolen our horizon.''

''When our tools shattered against frozen rock, or our [[Ships|boats]] capsized in rough seas, or [[bear]]s and [[shadowcat]]s snatched our [[Animals and plants|game]], we cursed the soft men of the [[Seven Kingdoms|green lands]] beyond the Wall. We cursed, and we envied.''

''Huddled around our fires, we told tales of how the southerners lived, how their stone houses touched the clouds, and their bellies touched the ground.''

''How their women fainted at the sight of blood, and wouldn't knife a man even when he slept. How they wouldn't miss a few [[Armament|swords]], or rings, or daughters.''

''But now we've seen the real south, and we have to admit, we're disappointed.''

''Southerners live life bent-over in the fields, in courts, in bed. They drink too little [[Food and drink|beer]], and they eat too many plants. In the [[Beyond the Wall|north]], a man's worth is in his hands and his stories, not his [[Noble house|fancy name]] and fancy talk.''

''With good steel, a man can hunt, kill, and live. What can a man do with [[Money|gold]] except shine? But what should I expect from a people who all want to sit on the [[Iron Throne|iron chair]]? A waste of good metal. You can make better seats. I've used 'em. How am I supposed to get comfortable on a bunch of swords?''

''Now I see why all your [[King|queens]] are [[Last War|fighting]] over it. Maybe your southern arses are soft enough to take it. But give me a proper seat any day, or a proper southern arse. As long as it isn't in the south.''

''From what I hear, [[King's Landing]] is even hotter and madder than [[Winterfell]]. Full of [[Oathbreaking|oathbreakers]], rich shits, and tiny women. They'll [[Bending the knee|kneel]] to anyone with an army or gold or special blood.''

''Nobody can tell me if it's more red or less red or what. Maybe it's purple. If the [[Daenerys Targaryen|Dragon Queen]] wants a bunch of kneelers to be stomping along after her, she can have 'em.''

''But my people have had enough. The [[Wight|dead]] are gone from the north. But the south is full of 'em. You just can't tell the difference.''
