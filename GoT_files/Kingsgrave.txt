{{Quote|A crowned skull: The Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.|[[Podrick Payne]]|Two Swords}}
'''Kingsgrave'''{{Ref|GOT401}} is a castle in [[Dorne]], the region controlled by [[House Martell]] of [[Sunspear]], and the seat of [[House Manwoody]]. The castle is located in the north-west of Dorne near the border with the [[Stormlands]]. It is east of the [[Prince's Pass]] and west of the [[Kingsroad]], located deep within the [[Red Mountains]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Kingsgrave is the seat of [[House Manwoody]], a loyal vassal house of the Martells.

The name "Kingsgrave" as well as the Manwoody sigil - a crowned skull - refer to the fact that an old [[King of the Reach]] was slain in battle there centuries ago.
