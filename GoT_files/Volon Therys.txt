'''Volon Therys'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a small town in western [[Essos]]. The town is located not far to the north-west of [[Volantis]], where the [[Rhoyne]] begins to separate out into its delta. The town is located on the western side of the river.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Volon Therys is a vassal of the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of Volantis. Volon Therys is the final stop for traders and travellers before Volantis itself, and Volantis maintains a watch on who is passing through the city, sometimes preventing them from travelling on to the main city. It is a noted waystop for mercenary companies unable to get permission to travel on to Volantis itself.

By the standards of the [[Free Cities]], Volon Therys is a middling-sized town, but would be counted as a small city by the standards of [[Westeros]].

According to ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Volon Therys was founded by the [[Valyrian Freehold]].
