Lord '''Owen Merryweather'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[Hand of the King]] to King [[Aerys II Targaryen]].{{Ref|H&L707}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lord Owen Merryweather was an old man at the time of [[Robert's Rebellion]] and was known for throwing feasts and lavishing praise on the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. During a feast that the king held when [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] came to court for the first time, Owen proposed that a tax be raised on wine, which led Lord Rykker to joke about [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] shitting gold.{{Bookref|AFFC|7}} Tywin's sister [[Genna Lannister|Genna]] remarks to [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] that her brother mockingly nicknamed Owen "the Chuckler," since his only skill was laughing at Aerys's pathetic jokes.{{Bookref|AFFC|33}} Jaime, who briefly knew Merryweather in his capacity as a knight of Aerys's [[Kingsguard]], describes him as being amiably natured, but overall an ineffectual sycophant.{{Bookref|AFFC|16}}

Owen was named [[Hand of the King]] after Tywin resigned from the position in 281 AC;  Cersei scathingly thinks that replacing her father with Merryweather was like replacing a destrier with a donkey.{{Bookref|AFFC|39}} Aerys was extremely paranoid and mistrusting of his son [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], which led to tension at court between the faction loyal to the king and those loyal to the prince. Lord Merryweather and [[Pycelle]] were tasked with keeping peace between the two factions.

Owen was ineffective in preventing the uprising that later became known as Robert's Rebellion. He sent missives of the lords of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], declaring Lords [[Jon Arryn]], [[Robert Baratheon]], and [[Eddard Stark]] outlaws and demanding that they be beheaded. Owen never left [[King's Landing]] and this, along with Ned and Robert's successful returns to [[Winterfell]] and [[Storm's End]] and the rebel victory at the [[Battle of Summerhall]], led the paranoid Aerys to believe that Owen was conspiring against him. The king then stripped Owen of his lands and titles and exiled him from Westeros, with [[Jon Connington]] replacing him as his Hand. Robert later returned [[House Merryweather]]'s titles and some of their lands to Owen's grandson Orton.
