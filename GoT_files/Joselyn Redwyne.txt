{{Quote|And how have you served the realm of late, Lady Redwyne, by eating cake?|[[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]|Second of His Name}}
'''Joselyn Redwyne''' is a member of [[House Redwyne]] during the reign of [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys I]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Joselyn is called "Lady Redwyne,"{{Ref|HOTD103}} but it is unclear whether she is the head of House Redwyne or the wife of the contemporary Lord Redwyne. Her relation to [[Lord Redwyne]] during the reign of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] is also unknown.

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Joselyn in company with her dog, join King [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]]'s hunting party on Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s second [[nameday]]. She socializes with [[Ceira Lannister]], [[Lynesse Hightower]], and [[Alicent Hightower]] in the royal tent. Lady Joselyn criticizes the [[War for the Stepstones]], for which she is shut down by [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]].{{Ref|HOTD103}}

==Behind the scenes==
[[Olenna Tyrell]] was born "Olenna Redwyne," so it appears that this similarly sharp-tongued noblewoman is intended to be her ancestor.

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'' and ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Joselyn Redwyne.

==Appearances==
*{{HOTD|Second of His Name}}
