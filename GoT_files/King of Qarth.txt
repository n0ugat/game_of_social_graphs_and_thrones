{{Quote|The proud Qartheen shook off the yoke of unjust Kings long ago... so they are told at festivals by the Pureborn, the Kings' direct descendants who have controlled the Thirteen ever since. Only now instead of scepters they use ships.|[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]]|Qarth (short)}}
The '''King of Qarth'''{{Ref|GOT207}} is a defunct title held by the ruler of the city of [[Qarth]] in [[Essos]]. Long ago the Qartheen rebelled against the King, and Qarth has been an oligarchy ever since.

The [[Pureborn]] are the descendants of the Kings of Qarth. They remain in power thanks to their hereditary seats at the [[Thirteen]], the city's ruling council, which effectively gives them control of the city.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]], a [[merchant]] from the [[Summer Isles]] and member of the Thirteen, conspires with [[Pyat Pree]] of the [[Warlocks]] to eliminate all other the members of the Thirteen to crown himself King of Qarth in exchange for Daxos' aid in stealing the [[dragon]]s of [[Daenerys Targaryen]].<ref>"[[A Man Without Honor]]"</ref> Though he was initially successful, Xaro Xhoan Daxos was entombed alive inside his own empty vault after Daenerys escaped the [[House of the Undying]].<ref>"[[Valar Morghulis]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, it is mentioned that Qarth was once a monarchy, though it is unknown how the rule of the city passed from the Kings and Queens to the Pureborn.
