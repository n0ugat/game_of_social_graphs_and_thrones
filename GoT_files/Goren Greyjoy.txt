Lord '''Goren Greyjoy'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the head of [[House Greyjoy]] and the [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]] during the reigns of King [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon I]] and [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Goren Greyjoy's story is the same. Early in King Aenys's reign, Goren put down a rebellion in the [[Iron Islands]], sending the rebel leader's head pickled in brine to [[King's Landing]] as a gesture of his loyalty. A grateful Aenys offered to grant any reward Goren might want in return; Goren shrewdly asked for the right to expel the [[Faith of the Seven]]'s worshippers from the Iron Islands. Having given his word, Aenys had no choice but to agree, straining relations between the Faith and [[House Targaryen]].
