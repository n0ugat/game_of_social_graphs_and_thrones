==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', Stygai is known as the "City of the Night," as it only sees the light of the sun for a brief period of time each day, around noon. It is a ruined city in the mountainous Shadow Lands, and lies on the river Ash in the Vale of Shadows. Stygai is said to be a haunted corpse city home to twisted creatures, such as demons and [[dragon]]s, and even [[shadowbinder]]s fear it.
