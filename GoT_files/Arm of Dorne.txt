The '''Arm of Dorne'''{{Ref|H&L101}}​ was a land bridge that the [[First Men]] used to pass from [[Essos]] into [[Westeros]] 12,000 years before the events of the series.<ref>"[[The Children of the Forest, the First Men, and the Andals]]"</ref> It was destroyed when the [[Children of the Forest]] used dark magic to raise the sea.<ref>"[[Wargs and the Sight]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Arm of Dorne was a land bridge which once linked southeastern Westeros and southwestern Essos. All that is left of the land bridge now is an archipelago called the [[Stepstones]], which is located in the [[Narrow Sea]] between the Broken Arm of Dorne and the [[Disputed Lands]].

Around 12,000 years before [[Aegon's Conquest]], the First Men came to Westeros from Essos by crossing the Arm of Dorne. When the First Men and the children of the forest first went to war, the old songs say [[Greenseer|greenseers]] of the children used dark magics to make the seas rise and sweep away the land, shattering the Arm, in a futile attempt to end the invasion of the First Men. Although the shattering of the Arm was successful, it was too late, for the First Men in Westeros had already crossed and the [[War of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|war]] went on until the [[Pact]].
