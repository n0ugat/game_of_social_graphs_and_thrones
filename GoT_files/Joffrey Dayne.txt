{{Quote|Joffrey Dayne, who answered Aegon the Conqueror's demand to submit by invading Aegon's Seven Kingdoms and marching an army to the gates of Oldtown, where Aegon had been crowned.|[[Eddard Stark]]|House Dayne (short)}}
Ser '''Joffrey Dayne''' was a knight of [[House Dayne]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]]. He was the Sword of the Morning during his time, and had wielded [[Dawn]], his family's ancestral sword.

==Biography==
When [[Aegon I Targaryen]] demanded that Joffrey and House Dayne surrender themselves, Joffrey marched with an army to [[Oldtown]], the city where Aegon had been crowned.{{Ref|H&L613}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Joffrey Dayne led an army from [[Starfall]] to [[Oldtown]] during the [[First Dornish War]]. He was unable to breach the city's walls and therefore had the fields, farms and villages burned for twenty leagues around the city. Lord [[Manfred Hightower]]'s son Garmon led a sortie against Joffrey, who killed him for it. He later melted back into the [[Red Mountains]] and [[King|Queen]] [[Visenya Targaryen]] and her [[dragon]] [[Vhagar]] attacked and burned Starfall in retaliation for his attack on Oldtown.

Unlike in the [[House Dayne (short)|thirteenth short]] of the [[Histories & Lore: Season 6|sixth season]] of ''[[Histories & Lore]]'', Sir Joffrey was never mentioned nor shown to have been a wielder of Dawn, nor was he a Sword of the Morning.
