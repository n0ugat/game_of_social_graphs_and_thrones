'''Steward'''{{Ref|GOT102}} is the title held by a senior member of a lord's household. Unlike the [[castellan]], the [[master-at-arms]], or the [[captain of the guard]], stewardship is not a military position. A steward is charged with organizing servants and managing the day-to-day activities of a lord's estate. In the case of [[king]]s or high lords, stewards may be nobles hailing from vassal houses, such as [[House Tyrell]] was to the [[House Gardener|Gardeners]] as [[High Steward of Highgarden|High Stewards]] of [[Highgarden]].
