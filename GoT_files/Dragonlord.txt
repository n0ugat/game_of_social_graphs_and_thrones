'''Dragonlords'''{{Ref|HOTD102}} were the rulers of the [[Valyrian Freehold]] who rode and controlled [[dragon]]s. They played a large role in the Valyrians' [[Ghiscari wars|defeat]] of the [[Ghiscari Empire]] to the east<ref>"[[Old Ghis & Slaver's Bay]]"</ref> and the [[Rhoynar]] people to the north, vastly expanding the size and power of the Freehold.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, "dragonlord" was a title reserved for members of the forty noble families that vied to actually rule the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. They were called dragonlords because they could ride and control [[dragon]]s using whips, horns and [[Magic|sorcery]]. It had long been the custom of the dragonlords of Valyria to [[Incest|wed brother to sister]] to keep their bloodlines pure, and they were said to be strikingly (some say inhumanly) beautiful. Polygamy was known among the dragonlords, but it was less common than incest and was considered somewhat odd. The books and expanded materials do not make explicit whether all dragon riders are also dragonlords; the difference may be in land ownership or familial prestige. 

Although organized by families, the dragonlords were not [[noble house]]s as seen in Westeros – they did not have heraldry or mottos, and were not institutionalized in quite the same way, as multiple freeholders from the same family could participate in government relatively equally.

Throughout the history of the Freehold, the number of dragonlords no doubt fluctuated depending on circumstances. During Valyria's [[Rhoynish Wars|wars against the Rhoynar]] over a thousand years ago, there were at least three hundred dragon riders, the number sent against the army of Prince Garin (who was soundly defeated). It is not clarified if every dragon rider in the Freehold was also a dragonlord.

The [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]] were a minor dragonlord family, far from the most powerful, but are the only family that survived the [[Doom of Valyria]] with dragons. Thus members of [[House Targaryen]] are known as dragonlords in [[Westeros]], even after the death of all the dragons.
