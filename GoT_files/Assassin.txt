'''Assassins'''{{Ref|GOT105}} are men and women who carry out the murder of individuals in exchange of monetary gain or for political reasons. Unlike [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], who wage war on behalf of their employers, assassins carry out surprise attacks using subterfuge and deceit.

There are also certain organizations of professional assassins in the world, such as the feared [[Faceless Men]] of [[Braavos]].
