{{Quote|Kayla is famous here to Volantis... in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.|Tyrion Lannister|Walk of Punishment (episode)}}
'''Kayla''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] who works in [[Littlefinger's brothel]].

==Biography==
===Background===
[[Image:Kayla3.jpg|thumb|Kayla is a talented contortionist.]]
Kayla is a prostitute and a highly skilled contortionist. According to [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], she is one of only four women in the [[known world]] who can bend her body to the extent that she can properly perform a sexual position known as the "[[Meereenese Knot]]".{{Ref|GOT303}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Along with [[Marei]] and [[Genna]], she is one of the three prostitutes in Littlefinger's brothel who are hired by Tyrion to service [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] as a reward for saving his life in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. Kayla and her colleagues are apparently so satisfied with Podrick that they decline payment, much to the astonishment of Tyrion, [[Bronn]], [[Ros]], and even [[Varys]].{{Ref|GOT303}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Kayla is present as an entertainer at the [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's wedding]]. Her performance is admired by [[Oberyn Martell]] and [[Ellaria Sand]].{{Ref|GOT402}}

==Behind the scenes==
The actress who plays Kayla, Pixie Le Knot, is a professional contortionist.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Kayla. The "[[Meereenese Knot]]" is an inside joke to the books fandom about a major plot issue [[George R.R. Martin]] had to deal with when writing ''A Dance With Dragons''.
