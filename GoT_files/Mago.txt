{{Quote|Khal fines assoe mezhah jahakmeni vos khal.<br>(A Khal who takes orders from a foreign whore is no Khal.)|Mago to [[Drogo]] about his wife [[Daenerys Targaryen]].|The Pointy End}}
'''Mago''' was a rider in Khal [[Drogo]]'s ''[[khalasar]]''.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Mago attends Drogo's wedding to the [[Westeros]]i exile [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. He watches as two warriors squabble over a dancer at the wedding.{{Ref|GOT101}}

Mago objects to Daenerys intervening and denying the [[Dothraki]] to take their share of the [[Lhazareen]] women as spoils of war. He refuses to recognize her authority as ''[[khaleesi]]'', calling her a foreign whore. He approaches and challenges the seething Drogo, slashing his khal slightly on the shoulder with his ''[[arakh]]''. The ''khal'' fights him, disdainfully disarming himself first and deliberately accepting the ''arakh'' wound to show contempt for Mago's combat skills. He quickly gains the upper hand, slitting his opponent's throat with his own sword and yanks his tongue out through the neck wound. Drogo brandishes the tongue for his court to see and casually tosses it on a pile of heads next to his seat.{{Ref|GOT108}}

Shortly after Mago's death, the wound he gave Drogo begins to fester,{{Ref|GOT109}} eventually leading to Drogo's incapacitation and subsequent death.{{Ref|GOT110}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mago is a member of Khal Drogo's ''[[khalasar]]'', serving under ''Ko'' [[Jhaqo]]. He complains to Drogo that Daenerys deprived him of his rape victim, a Lhazareen girl named Eroeh (who does not appear in the TV show) - but does not defy or fight with Drogo after the latter verbally denying him. Drogo is not injured by Mago, but during a battle against the ''khalasar'' of ''Khal'' Ogo.

Following Drogo's death, Mago becomes a bloodrider for Jhaqo, one of the several ''Kos'' that proclaim themselves ''Khals'', followed by a portion of Drogo's ''Khalasar''. He seizes Eroeh, rapes her and gives her to his new Khal. Jhaqo gives her to his other six bloodriders, who gang-rape her, and finally cut her throat. When Daenerys hears about this, she swears furiously that she will pay both Mago and Jhaqo back for what they did to Eroeh. So far she has not had a chance to fulfill her oath.

In the DVD commentary for the episode "The Pointy End", George R.R. Martin comments on the "butterfly effect" created when a character is killed off in the TV series, given that Mago continues to appear in the books.

In an interview dated July 12, 2011, Martin confirmed that Mago would be a recurring character in the sixth book.
