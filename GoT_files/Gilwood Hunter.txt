'''Gilwood Hunter''' is a member of [[House Hunter]]. His status is uncertain.

==Biography==
Gilwood Hunter is the sixthborn son of Ser [[Stentey Hunter]] and [[Serena Royce]].<ref name = "s1prop">''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]'' prop from Season 1</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Gilwood Hunter is mentioned in the section on House Royce in the Season 1 prop for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. The section on House Royce never appears on-screen in the TV series, as its planned appearance, where [[Eddard Stark]] would have read from it, was cut.

==In the books==
Gilwood Hunter appears in ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', but his genealogy is different, being the son of and heir of Lord [[Eon Hunter]], rather than of the knight Stentey Hunter (who does not exist in the book series). Gilwood is nearing fifty years old at the beginning of the book series and inherits his father's titles after Eon is suddenly murdered. The youngest son of Eon, Harlan, attempts to push the theory that it was Gilwood who killed Eon, but Petyr Baelish considers it more likely that it was Harlan himself who was behind the murder.
