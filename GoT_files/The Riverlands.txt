==Narration==
'''Brynden Tully''': ''Men have fought over the [[Riverlands]] since the [[Dawn Age]], but that's to be expected of things that rest below the [[Neck]].''

''Doesn't help that the Riverlands are between everything and everything else. The [[Westerlands]]' gold, the [[Reach]]'s grain, the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]'s rock and the [[North]]'s... snow?''

[[House Mudd|''House Mudd'']]'' once ruled as the [[King of the Rivers and Hills|Kings of the Rivers and Hills]], but after a thousand years, their line was exhausted and fell to the [[Storm King]]s, who fell to the [[Ironborn]]. I suppose after years of drowning at sea, our rivers looked pretty attractive to that race of pirates and rapers.''

''Never mind that their monstrous castle, [[Harrenhal]], was too large to staff and garrison. It turned out the Ironborn would not be there long enough to bother. [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] landed to our south and, as had many before him, liked the look of the Riverlands.''

''My ancestor [[Edmyn Tully]] led the desertion of Riverlords to his cause and was rewarded by getting to watch King [[Harren Hoare|Harren]] burn in his own tower.''

''Unfortunately, that's not all Edmyn got. House Tully was named the [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]], which means we had to keep in line all those lords who hadn't governed themselves for thousands of years. We were now responsible for aiding [[House Mallister|the Mallisters]] at [[Seagard]] against the pouting Ironborn, whenever they got cheeky.''

''For settling Harrenhal on families stupid enough to think its curse would skip them, after devouring all previous families.''

''For keeping [[House Blackwood|the Blackwoods]] and [[House Bracken|Brackens]] from wiping each other out, and giving us two more castles to deal with. For keeping [[House Frey|the Freys]] in their place and out of others' pockets. For marrying off our sons and daughters wisely enough so that we didn't follow House Mudd into, well, the mud.''

''Yet under the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]], the Riverlands knew a peace we hadn't had for centuries, if ever. But like all good things, sooner or later, it all goes to shit. And our shit had a name. [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]].''

''[[Westeros]] has had its share of Mad Kings, but usually, they had the sense not to bully more than one powerful house at a time. Aerys soon blundered into a triple alliance. The [[North]], the [[Stormlands]], and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] rose against him.''

''But of course, where do you think most of the blood was spilled? My brother [[Hoster Tully|Hoster]] guaranteed the answer to that with the marriage of [[Catelyn Stark|my niece]] to [[Eddard Stark]], the [[Warden of the North]]. At least Hoster didn't send her to [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]].''

''So, the Riverlands joined the war against the Mad King; and it was on [[Trident|one of our rivers]] that Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] died, sealing the fate of [[House Targaryen|his dynasty]].''

''Robert was a great soldier and a horrible king. Drinking and whoring are their own brand of madness when you sit on [[Iron Throne|a throne that everybody wants]]. He died and [[War of the Five Kings|another war]] started. Again the armies marched, again the Riverlands burned.''

''If [[Westeros]] is not careful, pretty soon our people will grow some sense and abandon this place for a safer realm, like the [[Dothraki Sea]]. I joke, of course.''

''The Riverlands are our home and gods help us, we love it. Still, as they say, "the king eats and the [[Hand of the King|Hand]] takes the shit." The same is true of the Riverlands – the [[Seven Kingdoms]] piss and the Riverlands change clothes.''
