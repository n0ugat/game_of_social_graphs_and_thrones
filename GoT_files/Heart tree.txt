{{Quote|In time, the First Men adopted the Children's gods as their own. Most castles at that time contained a godswood with a weirwood or a heart tree at its center.|[[Bran Stark]]|The Old Gods and the New (Histories & Lore)}}
A '''heart tree'''{{Ref|GOT107}} is the center of a [[godswood]]. It is a [[weirwood]] tree that has a face carved into the wood of the trunk. Heart trees are sacred in the religion of the [[Old Gods]], and the closest thing to a "shrine" that the religion possesses.

Weirwoods have red sap, which leaks out of the deep cuts in the trunk made for the eyes of the faces - giving the appearance that they are weeping tears of blood. The faces are thought to have been carved by the [[Children of the Forest]] and were later worshiped by the [[First Men]] as well.<ref name="VG Dawn Age">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/beyond-the-houses/ HBO Viewer's Guide, Season 2 appendices, Westeros Through the Ages - Dawn Age entry]</ref>
