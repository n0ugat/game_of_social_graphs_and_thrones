{{Quote|If they fail in the battlefield, they will shame Astapor.|Greizhen mo Ullhor on selling half-trained [[Unsullied]]|Walk of Punishment (episode)}}
'''Greizhen mo Ullhor''' was a slave-trader in the city of [[Astapor]], on the coast of [[Slaver's Bay]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Greizhen mo Ullhor is of the [[Good Masters]], the ruling elite of the city. He is an immensely wealthy [[Slavery|slaver]] who has grown rich from the training and trading of the [[Unsullied]] warrior-eunuchs.{{Ref|GOT303}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Greizhen accompanies fellow Good Master [[Kraznys mo Nakloz]] and a third Good Master for negotiations with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and is amused by Kraznys' comments about her. When Daenerys states that she wants to buy not just the fully-trained Unsullied but the slaves in training as well, Greizhen opposes, concerned that if these half-trained warriors fail on the battlefield it would shame Astapor.{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:KraznysGreizhen.jpg|thumb|Greizhen and Kraznys about to deliver the Unsullied]]
Greizhen is present at one of Astapor's plazas for the conclusion of the transaction with Daenerys: the Unsullied and the half-trained boys in exchange for her [[dragon]], [[Drogon]]. He is killed when Daenerys orders the Unsullied to kill all the Good Masters, slave-drivers, and soldiers in the city, sparing only the children, and to liberate all the slaves.{{Ref|GOT304}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, when Daenerys meets with the Good Masters, one of them, Grazdan mo Ullhor, is hesitant to sell the half-trained Unsullied because, if defeated, Astapor and the Good Masters would be shamed. The name seems to have been changed because Grazdan is a common name in [[Slaver's Bay]].

During the fall of Astapor, Grazdan yells to the Unsullied to defend their masters, but they do not comply. He is killed by [[Rakharo]].
