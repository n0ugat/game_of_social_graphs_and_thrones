'''Widow's blood'''{{Ref|H&L404}} is a [[poison]]. It causes the victim's bowels and bladder to fail and they die a slow and painful death, drowning in their own poisons.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, widow's blood is named so for its color. It shuts down the bladder and bowels until the person dies from the body's own poisons.

During [[Court trial of Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion's trial]] for the presumed murder of [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], [[Pycelle]] testifies that [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] had stolen several substances of his, including widow's blood, but confirms that Joffrey's death was caused by another poison - the [[strangler]].

There is a fan theory that [[Oberyn Martell]] poisoned [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] with widow's blood; it is based on the decaying condition of Tywin's body and its terrible stench, as described at his funeral, and what Oberyn told Tyrion before the [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] ("''your father may not live forever''").
