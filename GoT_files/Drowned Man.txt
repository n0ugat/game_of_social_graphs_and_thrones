A '''Drowned Man''' conducts his services on [[Pyke (island)|Pyke]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[File:TheonMeetsDrownedMan.jpg|thumb|The Drowned Priest baptizes Theon.]]
This [[Drowned Men|Drowned Man]] is the one who conducts the baptism of [[Theon Greyjoy]] after his return to Pyke and his decision to join [[Balon Greyjoy|his father]] in his [[Ironborn invasion of the North|invasion]] of the [[North]].{{Ref|GOT203}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Aeron Greyjoy]] presides over Theon's baptism, and he does this as soon as Theon arrives in Pyke, before taking him to the castle. Given that Aeron "Damphair" Greyjoy is Theon's uncle and an important character in later books in the series, the producers wanted to forgo having to make a major casting decision until his main storyline begins.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2011/09/character-cuts-whos-in-and-whos-out-of-season-two/ Winter is Coming article on season 2 casting cuts]</ref> Aeron made his series debut in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|sixth season]] episode "[[Home]]", but his storyline from the novels was abandoned.
