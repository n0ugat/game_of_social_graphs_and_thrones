==Synopsis==
===In the Crownlands===
Lord Eddard Stark wakes up after a long period of unconsciousness, due to the injuries inflicted on him by [[Jaime Lannister]]'s men. He finds both King [[Robert Baratheon]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] waiting. 
[[Image:Robert's hunting party.jpg|thumb|right|King Robert's hunting party.]]

Cersei is furious with Eddard's acts in having her brother [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrested and attacking Jaime in the street. She wants Robert to take action against him, but Robert refuses to condemn him without hearing Eddard's side, and tells her to be silent. When Cersei protests further, and calls Robert a woman, he hits her. She says that she will wear the bruise with honor. He tells her to be silent, or he will honor her again, and Cersei leaves in anger. Afterwards, Robert restores Eddard to his position as [[Hand of the King|King's Hand]], and tells him not to quit again, or he will give the position to Jaime Lannister. He tells Lord Eddard to end the animosity between [[House Stark]] and [[House Lannister]], as strife between these two powerful houses could lead them into war. He is leaving on a hunt and wants the realm at peace by the time he returns.

[[Arya Stark|Arya]] has another [[water dance|water dancing]] lesson with [[Syrio Forel]], but isn't in the mood due to [[Jory Cassel|Jory]]'s death. Syrio tells her that she may need to fight at any time, not just when she's in the mood. He wisely reminds her that being prepared to fight is more important in times of sadness than in peaceful times of happiness.

King Robert is out hunting, accompanied by his brother [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and [[Lancel Lannister]]. Robert, being supplied with wine by Lancel, becomes drunk and nostalgic, longing for the days of young knights trying to make a name for themselves and when enemies stood openly in opposition (instead of being hidden schemers). Robert brags about all the women he has bedded, but Renly becomes irate when he begins to question him about his history with women. Renly calls him a fool and remarks that the past had its share of violence that Robert is conveniently ignoring. Renly storms off, leaving Ser Barristan to look on concerned, as Lancel keeps up King Robert's wine supply.

In King's Landing, at a meeting of the [[Small Council]], a group of refugees come to tell of how their villages have been destroyed. Eddard hears tales of a huge knight ravaging the [[Riverlands]]. He realizes that it's Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], "The Mountain", who is likely under Lannister orders to punish the Riverlands - which are held by [[House Tully]], the former House of his wife Catelyn, who now holds Tyrion captive. Even though King Robert told him to make peace with the Lannisters, Lord Eddard could not bring himself to let this injustice stand. Eddard strips Gregor Clegane of his knighthood, land, and titles, and sends Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]] with a retinue of one hundred [[Knighthood|knights]] to arrest and execute him in the king's name. 
[[Image:Eddard and the book.jpg|thumb|Eddard discovers the secret Jon Arryn died for.]]
He also orders Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] to send word to [[Casterly Rock]], demanding Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]'s presence in court to explain his bannerman's actions or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm. 'Littlefinger' [[Petyr Baelish]], and Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] are both concerned with the harshness of these orders and Eddard's actions against the Lannisters, but Eddard wants to see justice done.

Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] comes to apologize to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] for the incident on the [[Kingsroad]]. He calls her his lady love and gives her a necklace. Sansa forgives him, and they seem reconciled. Sansa is unaware that the Queen put Joffrey up to the apology some time ago.

Eddard decides to send his daughters back to Winterfell. Arya is worried that she must leave Syrio. Sansa protests that no one cares about her trivial dancing instructor, for they are talking about breaking her betrothal to Joffrey. Lord Eddard says that he will find someone else for her. Sansa refuses—she is going to marry Joffrey and have lots of golden-haired babies. This gives Eddard pause and sends him back to the [[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms|book]] that [[Jon Arryn]] was looking at before he died. Consulting the book's entry on [[House Baratheon]], Lord Eddard finds that every time a Baratheon has married, the children have had black hair…right up to Cersei and Robert's children, who are all blond.

===In the North===
[[Image:Stiv and Osha.jpg|thumb|Stiv and Osha accost Bran near Winterfell.]]
In [[Winterfell]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] has another dream about the [[Brynden Rivers|Three-Eyed Raven]], in which it flies into the castle's crypts. He wakes up to find that [[Hodor]] has brought the finished saddle designed by Tyrion. He goes on a ride with [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]]. They have had word from King's Landing about Eddard's injury, [[Jory Cassel|Jory]]'s death and Tyrion's capture. Theon thinks that Robb should prepare the [[North]] for war, but Robb is determined to make his own decision for when that time has come, and until then will follow his parents' orders to remain in Winterfell. They discover that Bran has wandered off on his horse and go looking for him. Robb finds a group of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] threatening Bran and trying to steal his horse. Robb kills two, but another wildling holds Bran with a knife to the throat. Theon shoots him from behind, angering Robb by endangering Bran. The remaining wildling, a woman named [[Osha]], yields and begs for her life. Robb agrees to take her as a prisoner.

[[File:Theon 1x06.jpg|thumb|Theon tells Ros he will miss her as she leaves for King's Landing.]]
[[Ros]], the prostitute that Theon frequently sees, is departing Winterfell for King's Landing on the back of a turnip cart. Theon stops her and unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay. She explains that war is now imminent and the men (and thus her customer base) of Winterfell are destined to leave soon and probably never return; her departure is thus an economically essential decision. He throws her a coin to get her to raise her skirt one last time. As she rides off he says that he will miss her. She agrees that he will.[[Image:Tyrion and Mord.jpg|thumb|Tyrion's verbal skills are wasted on Mord.]]

===At the Eyrie===
At the Eyrie, Tyrion almost rolls out of his sky cell in his sleep, to his consternation. He tries to make a bargain with the gaoler, [[Mord]], to no avail.
Tyrion convinces Mord to carry a message to Lady [[Lysa Arryn]] and, in exchange, he will give Mord the gold he had with him when he was captured. Lysa summons Tyrion, believing that the sky cell has broken his spirit, but all he confesses to is being a liar, a whoremonger, and a player of disgusting practical jokes. He maintains his innocence of the crimes of conspiracy to commit murder, specifically that of Bran Stark. 

[[Image:Tyrion on trial.jpg|thumb|Tyrion on trial in the Eyrie.]]
However, Tyrion uses the opportunity of his audience in front of Lysa's court to publicly demand his right to justice and a trial, and Lysa is shamed into agreeing. Given that Lysa's [[Robin Arryn|son]] is a young boy and wouldn't make a good judge in a formal trial, Tyrion instead demands a [[trial by combat]], which Lysa also reluctantly agrees is his right. Given that neither Lysa nor her young son can fight in a trial by combat, she asks for a volunteer to be her champion, and Ser [[Vardis Egen]] agrees. Egen is unwilling to fight Tyrion however, as killing such an outmatched opponent would be dishonorable. Tyrion names his own champion: his brother Jaime, considered one of the best swordsmen in the realm. At this Lysa does object, as Jaime is not present and she does not want to wait. She demands that he pick a champion from those present. Tyrion desperately asks for volunteers, and after a long pause during which it seems that Tyrion's cause is lost, the [[Mercenary|sellsword]] [[Bronn]] steps forward and says he will stand for him.[[Image:Bronn defeats Vardis.jpg|thumb|Bronn kicks Ser Vardis Egen's corpse out of the Moon Door.]]
Bronn fights defensively, waiting for Vardis to tire from being dressed in his full armor. Bronn finally gets his chance; he first wounds and then kills Vardis, sending his body rolling out of the "Moon Door" that leads to a thousand-foot drop. Lysa complains that Bronn did not fight with honor. Bronn agrees, but indicates that Vardis did fight with honor. Having proven his innocence in the eyes of [[Faith of the Seven|the gods]], Tyrion retrieves his gold from Ser Rodrik and gives it to Mord. When Robin asks if he can make the little man fly now, Tyrion says, "This little man is going home." Bronn and Tyrion are allowed to depart.

===In Vaes Dothrak===
[[Image:Dany and the egg.jpg|thumb|Daenerys holds a dragon egg.]]
In [[Vaes Dothrak]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] is studying her [[dragon]] eggs. Despite [[Illyrio Mopatis|Illyrio]]'s claim that they are now only stone, she ponders if they might be hatched by extreme heat, and places an egg on a brazier. Nothing happens, to her disappointment. She is removing the egg from the brazier, when [[Irri]] comes in and thinks she will burn herself. Irri takes the egg from her, but Daenerys is completely unharmed, and it is Irri who suffers burns on her own hands.
Daenerys is summoned by the crones who rule the city, the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]'', the wives of ''[[khal]]s ''slain in battle. She eats a stallion's raw heart and the crones read the omens. At first it seems Dany won't keep the organ down, but, to both her and Drogo's relief, she is able to compose herself. The crones declare Daenerys and [[Drogo]]'s son will be "The Stallion That Mounts The World", a great conqueror whose coming is long foretold in [[Dothraki]] history. Daenerys says his name will be "[[Rhaego]]", for her brother [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]], slain by the usurper Robert Baratheon. Viserys is not impressed and rather disgusted by it all, despite an explanation of the ritual from [[Jorah Mormont]]. It is only when the Dothraki are chanting Rhaego's name, and Drogo lifts Daenerys up and carries her about the room, that Viserys realizes they love her. 
[[Image:Jorah and Viserys.jpg|thumb|Jorah prevents Viserys from stealing Dany's eggs.]]
Jealous of the tribe's worship of his sister, Viserys storms out of the tent. He is later discovered in Daenerys' tent by Ser [[Jorah Mormont]], trying to steal Dany's dragon eggs, but Jorah won't let him. Viserys tells Ser Jorah that to rule one must be feared or loved, and he has never been loved as the Dothraki love Dany. He says he knows that Jorah wants Daenerys, but he doesn't care. He just wants the eggs so he can hire an army, but he can't get past Ser Jorah and must leave the eggs. Mormont watches him as he leaves.

Drunk, bitter and angry, Viserys interrupts a feast for Daenerys and Drogo. He angrily demands his payment in return for giving Daenerys to Drogo. He draws his sword, which is considered an offense punishable by death in the sacred city, and threatens Dany and the unborn child, while Irri translates to Drogo. 
[[Image:Viserys' crowning.jpg|thumb|Khal Drogo gives Viserys a golden crown.]]
Drogo responds that he will give Viserys a golden crown "that men will tremble to behold", and Viserys is pleased until Drogo's bloodrider [[Qotho]] seizes him and breaks his arm, making him drop the sword, and kicks him to the floor. Drogo melts his golden belt of medallions in a pot, while Viserys begs Daenerys to help him. Ser Jorah tells her to look away, but she won't. She watches as Khal Drogo "crowns" Viserys by pouring molten gold over his head, causing Viserys to cry out horridly in agony. Viserys falls forward, his head making a loud clang as it connects with the floor. As Daenerys watches her brother die, she coldly states that, having been killed by fire, Viserys was no true dragon.

==Behind the scenes==
===General===
*The episode takes its name from the "golden crown" [[Drogo]] gives [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]].
**It may also have a metaphorical meaning in that the word "crown" can also refer to the top of one's head or the entire head. So, a "golden crown" when "crown" is used this way, could mean blond-headed or, to use the terminology from this episode, "golden haired." This would refer to Ned's revelation of Joffrey's parentage.
*Actor Sean Bean had the flu while filming this episode, so the fevered appearance that Ned Stark has after being stabbed in the leg (particularly when he first wakes up in bed and speaks with Robert and Cersei) is actually a genuine physical reaction by the actor.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays DenOfGeek]</ref>
*According to Emilia Clarke, for the scene where Daenerys eats a horse's heart, the prop she used was made of gummy bear-like material; it tasted awful even though she likes {{WPS|Gummy bear|gummy bears}}. Her difficulty choking it down is her actual physical reaction. The gummy-heart was injected with fake blood which was essentially a sugary syrup, so that it could burst out as she bit into the heart. The crew kept injecting it to maintain moisture. By the end the actress was covered in the stuff which was like glue and everything stuck to her. When she used the bathroom she stuck to the toilet seat.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays DenOfGeek] and [http://winteriscoming.net/2012/12/emilia-clarke-on-jimmy-kimmel-live/ Emilia Clark on Jimmy Kimmel Live], December 11, 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/television/1264476/46_things_we_learned_from_the_game_of_thrones_blurays.html Den of Geek]</ref>
*Viserys notes that Jorah Mormont is blocking him from leaving with the dragon eggs by saying "Here you stand." and Jorah stares him down by replying and emphasizing "Yet here I stand." According to semi-canon sources, the words of House Mormont are "Here We Stand". It is not clear if this was an intentional reference.
*Originally the meaning of the phrase "make the eight" was unclear. However, it appears to be a reference to the fact that the Riverlands, having been under the occupation of the King of the Iron Islands at the time of Aegon's Conquest, is not counted as one of the Seven Kingdoms in the TV series. In the novels, the term is considerably looser and more open to interpretation.
*Set designer and art director, [[Gemma Jackson]], credits the inspiration for the Eyrie as being the Basilica Di San Clemente in Rome. The weirwood throne was made up of three pieces of unpainted wood. Additionally, the [[throne room]] of the [[Red Keep]] was inspired by the Pantheon in Rome.<ref>Blue-ray disc special feature "Anatomy of an Episode"</ref>
*The trial by combat scene had to be filmed across multiple takes, and during one actor [[Jerome Flynn]] (Bronn) accidentally slipped and fell on melted wax, which was left there from a previous take when he knocked over the candelabra. In one take, he fell into the prop opening for the Moon Door.<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/game-of-thrones-bronn-jerome-flynn-comic-con.html Vulture.com], NYCC 2013 report.</ref>
*Joffrey mentions the northern and southernmost castles of Westeros as being the Last Hearth in the north (the seat of [[House Umber]]) and [[Salt Shore]] (in [[Dorne]]) in the south. This is not strictly accurate: the northern-most castles in the realm are the castles at the [[Wall]], most notably [[Castle Black]]. It is arguable that the southernmost castles are actually on the island known as the [[Arbor]], but the maps do not reveal at what end of the island the castles lie. It is possible that Joffrey omitted the castles of the Night's Watch on the Wall due to their extra-legal status, and also he was speaking of the "lords and ladies" who would come to a royal wedding, which the Night's Watch doesn't have.
**There was a discussion of how Jack Gleeson should play this scene. At first he was going to be disingenuous, but then it was decided that he was more weak than evil, as he is not utterly corrupted until he inherits the throne. He is sincerely apologizing as he did really want a girlfriend. The scene was filmed in an overly romantic way to make it seem melodramatic.<ref>Season 1 Blue-Ray disc special feature - Anatomy of an Episode</ref>
*Eddard mentions several members of [[House Baratheon]] detailed in the novels while reading the house's entry in Pycelle's book: [[Orys Baratheon]], the founder of the house; [[Lyonel Baratheon]], the Laughing Storm, a great knight featured in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s "Dunk and Egg" stories; and [[Steffon Baratheon]], the father of Robert, Renly, and Stannis.
*Viserys's death scene had to be performed in only one take, because it would ruin his costume after the first and only attempt. Smoke machines were strapped to his back and chest, a bald cap was made to resemble molten gold across his face, and the props department forged a gold-like substance that was poured over his head.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/21095/46-things-we-learned-from-the-game-of-thrones-blu-rays DenOfGeek]</ref>
*Viserys calls his sister "Dany". Daenerys is referred to by that name in her POV book chapters by the writer, but is very rarely addressed as "Dany" by other characters, both in the books and the show. In fact, Viserys is the only book character who ever used it, and only on one occasion - in the parallel book scene.
*Eddard assigns [[Beric Dondarrion]] to find and kill the Mountain. The subsequent encounter between Beric and the Mountain, known as the [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford]], is referred to very vaguely in [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]] episode "[[Kissed by Fire]]" (Beric's comment "Second time I've been killed by a Clegane"). A full account of the battle is given in the Blu-ray short "[[Brotherhood Without Banners (short)|Brotherhood Without Banners]]," but never in the show itself.
*The meaning of Jon Arryn's last words "the seed is strong" is finally revealed in this episode: in modern terms, the meaning is that the Baratheon genes are dominant over the Lannister genes, thus it is unlikely that Cersei would give birth to three golden-haired children in a row - unless Robert is not their biological father.
*In the book, Robert goes to hunt a white hart which has been sighted in the [[Kingswood]]. He and his escorts find it too late, eaten by wolves. Robert becomes furious until he hears talk of some monstrous boar deeper in the forest, and decides to hunt it instead. These details have been omitted from the show, but the hunt scenes from ''[[House of the Dragon]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s episode "[[Second of His Name]]" are loosely based on them.
*Viserys's death might have inspired by the death of the Roman general [[Wikipedia:Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]]: according to the Greek historian Plutarch, the Parthians poured molten gold into his mouth in a symbolic mockery of his thirst for wealth.

===Commentary===
The Blu-ray and DVD releases of this episode feature a commentary by director Daniel Minahan and actor Peter Dinklage in New York City, and Harry Lloyd and Emilia Clarke in London.

*The scene where Robert forces Eddard to become the Hand again was Mark Addy's last scene shot for the series.
*Peter Dinklage points out that Mark Addy is not as big as Robert in the books, but Mark's larger-than-life performance sells the role.
*The costume and make-up designers worked hard not to make Harry Lloyd look like Legolas from Peter Jackson's {{WPS|The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings''}} trilogy.
*Emilia Clarke was charmed when Isaac Hempstead-Wright gave her half of his {{WPS|Fudge (chocolate bar)|fudge bar}}.
*Harry Lloyd is a fan of Natalia Tena's band.
*There was some debate about using CGI breath for the really cold scenes filmed in warmer weather, but it was decided it looked too fake.
*Peter Dinklage was unaware that Maisie Williams used her off-hand for the sword-fighting scenes to match Arya in the books, and was impressed. Maisie cried on cue during the read-through of the scene where she has to drive Nymeria away, impressing Harry Lloyd.
*Peter Dinklage said that the scene where Daenerys eats the horse's heart is his wife's favorite scene of the entire series.
*The scene between Viserys and Jorah was discussed between the two actors and David Benioff to get the right tone to the scene.
*Peter Dinklage had no padding for the scenes where Mord beats him in the sky cell, and ended up with some bruises at the end of the day.
*Some actors were given prosthetic scars while others had real scars that were highlighted with makeup.
*The throne dais in the Eyrie had no safety rail, so actress Kate Dickie was directed to keep hold of Lino Facioli when he stood up as a safety precaution.
*The Moon Door led to a pit filled with cardboard boxes.
*Harry Lloyd likens the Vale to Wales, and finds the fact that Ser Vardis Egen has a Welsh accent very appropriate.
*Peter Dinklage was a fan of Kate Dickie from some of her British film work and was looking forward to meeting her.
*Originally the episode opened with Ser Gregor Clegane sacking a village in the Riverlands, but this was cut for time and budget concerns.
*Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke only read the books once they finished filming, so as to be surprised by the process as it goes along. Bryan Cogman also tracked down scenes from later books that gave more info about the characters and their motivations and recommended them to the actors.
*Harry Lloyd looks at fan art online, and particularly enjoyed a fan map of [[Braavos]] that he found on the internet.
*Emilia Clarke was disappointed that the elaborate and lengthy climb to the Eyrie was not in the TV series.
*Peter Dinklage noted the name similarity between Jack Gleeson and comedian {{WPS|Jackie Gleason}} and found it amusing.
*Peter Dinklage debated with his wife whether it was realistic for there to be only one prostitute in Winterfell. However, she pointed out in a small community there was only likely to be one, or at least one popular one.
*The coin Ros catches from the back of the cart is CGI.
*Harry Lloyd studied a lot of "drunk walking" videos on YouTube for his final scene.
*The sword Harry Lloyd used in the final scene was very sharp and had to be handled carefully.
*Drogo's gold belt melted far too quickly. Lloyd deadpans this is because it is "Dothraki hybrid gold" that melts much quicker than normal and then solidifies again.
*The final shot of Daenerys required multiple takes because it was tricky to keep the camera in focus as it zoomed in close on her face.
