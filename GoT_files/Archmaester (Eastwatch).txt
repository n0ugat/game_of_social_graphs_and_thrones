This '''man''' is an [[Archmaester]] of the [[Citadel]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
He met with the other [[Archmaester]]s of the [[Citadel]] to discuss a [[raven]] they had received from [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Wolkan]] of [[Winterfell]] claiming that [[Bran Stark]] has seen the [[Night King]] and his army marching on [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]] through [[warg]]ing. He compared the content of the message to the work of [[Jenny of Oldstones]], a woodswitch who claimed to be descended from the [[Children of the Forest]].{{Ref|GOT705}}
