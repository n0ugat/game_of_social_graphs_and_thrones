{{Quote|A foolish King of the Rock took House Lannister's Brightroar to Valyria, and neither blade nor man was seen again.|Ser [[Jorah Mormont]]|Valyrian Steel (short)}}
'''Brightroar'''{{Ref|H&L415}} is a [[Valyrian steel]] blade that was the ancestral weapon of [[House Lannister]]. It was lost when [[Tommen II Lannister]], [[King of the Rock]], took it on his expedition to the ruins of [[Old Valyria|Valyria]] and disappeared.

The lack of a Valyrian steel sword for House Lannister drove [[Tywin Lannister]] to have [[Ice]], the Valyrian steel greatsword of [[House Stark]], reforged into [[Oathkeeper|two]] [[Widow's Wail|blades]].{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Brightroar was the ancestral Valyrian steel greatsword of House Lannister. House Lannister has been searching for a replacement ever since it was lost. 

Tywin tried numerous times to buy one from impoverished noble houses but was always rebuffed, lords preferring to offer their daughters in marriage rather than part from such valuable heirlooms. 

Tywin's youngest brother, [[Gerion Lannister|Gerion]], went into an expedition to the [[Valyrian peninsula]] approximately in 291 AC, with the goal of finding Brightroar; like King Tommen II, he never returned.
