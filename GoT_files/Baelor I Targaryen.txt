King '''Baelor I Targaryen''', commonly called '''Baelor the Blessed''' or '''Blessed Baelor''', was the ninth [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]], ascending the throne after the death of his elder brother [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron I]]. He is known for his zealous piety.

==Biography==
===Background===
Baelor was the ninth [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]] in the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]], ascending the throne after the death of his elder brother [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron I]]. He had the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], which became the center of the [[Faith of the Seven]], built during his reign in the city of [[King's Landing]]. A large statue of him was later erected in front of the Great Sept.{{Ref|GOT109}}

During his reign, he had the [[Maidenvault]] built inside the [[Red Keep]] and imprisoned [[Daena Targaryen|his]] [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aegon III)|three]] [[Elaena Targaryen|sisters]] to prevent carnal temptations.{{Ref|H&L309}}

Though famed for his holiness and piety, he was also a religious zealot. Among Baelor's follies, he named [[High Septon (boy)|a six-year-old boy]] as [[High Septon]] because he was convinced the child could work miracles after he talked to a dove. He also gave the title to [[High Septon (stonemason)|a simple stonemason]] because he believed he was the [[Smith]] reincarnated. Baelor also saved his cousin [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon Targaryen]] from a snake pit, thinking that the vipers would not harm a man who was so devoted to the Faith. However, he was bitten twelve times and was forced to lay in bed for six months. He starved himself into an early grave with his frequent religious fasting, believing that the [[Known world]] was sinful and food was from the known world.{{Ref|GOT403}}

Given that Baelor abhorred desires of the flesh, he died without issue and was succeeded by his uncle and [[Hand of the King|Hand]], [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys II Targaryen]].{{Cite}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
When [[Eddard Stark]] is dragged out of the dungeons to make a forced (and false) confession of [[treason]] on the steps of the Great Sept of Baelor, he spots [[Arya Stark|Arya]] (who escaped capture by the Lannisters) hiding in the crowd near a statue of King Baelor. He also sees the loyal [[Night's Watch]] recruiter [[Yoren]] in the crowd, and as the guards lead him past he utters one quick word to him: "Baelor". This directs Yoren's attention to the statue, and notices Arya.{{Ref|GOT109}}

After Eddard makes his false confession, [[Pycelle]] pontificates to the crowd that Baelor taught the realm mercy, which is why Lord Stark's life will be spared and he will be [[Exile|exiled]] to the [[Wall]]. King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], however, in a display of petty cruelty says that mercy is for women, and demands that Eddard be [[Execution of Eddard Stark|executed]] on the spot. Ser [[Ilyn Payne|Ilyn]] then beheads Eddard. Thanks to Eddard's warning, however, Yoren is able to drag the terrified Arya away and successfully assists her in escaping from the city.{{Ref|GOT109}}

[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] mentions that Baelor the Blessed is one of the kings analyzed in the classic book, ''[[The Lives of Four Kings]]''.{{Ref|GOT402}}

[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] recounts Baelor the Blessed's follies, including naming a six-year-old boy as High Septon, while conversing with his grandson, [[Tommen Baratheon]], about the necessary qualities required in a good king.{{Ref|GOT403}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
While meeting at a chapel deep below the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], the [[High Sparrow]] tells [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] that Baelor built his Great Sept atop the more humble [[sept]]. He praises the sept's builders, who didn't leave their names or any sign of their identities, for not inflicting their vanity on those who came after them, unlike Baelor with his "gilded monstrosity".{{Ref|GOT507}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Just after the trial of [[Loras Tyrell]], the Great Sept of Baelor is [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|destroyed]] with [[wildfire]] in a plot orchestrated by Cersei so that she could evade her own trial, which was scheduled to take place just after Loras's, and destroy her enemies.{{Ref|GOT610}}

In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Baelor is the second son of Aegon III, the Dragonbane, and ruled after the death of his brother Daeron I Targaryen, the Young Dragon. He wished to become a [[septon]], but his father refused, instead insisting that he marry his sister [[Daena Targaryen|Daena]] in the traditional Targaryen manner. Baelor obeyed, but extremely reluctantly, and refused to consummate the marriage.

Upon his brother King Daeron I's death, Baelor is said to have begun his reign by walking the [[Boneway]] barefoot to make peace with [[Dorne]]. It is also said that he saved his cousin [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]] from a snake pit, where he was bitten many times by the vipers whose venom could not kill him because of his faith in the [[Seven]]; this tale may simply be a metaphorical version of his visit to Dorne, referring to Dorne itself as a "snake pit," and the Dornish, "vipers." Whatever the truth, Baelor returned home, having negotiated the marriage of his nephew [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron]] to [[Myriah Martell]] as a means of making peace with Dorne after Daeron I's failed conquest. Years after Baelor died, when Daeron was crowned as King Daeron II, he negotiated the marriage of his much younger sister [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys]] to [[Maron Martell]], Myriah's brother, thereby uniting the realms.

Baelor apparently suffered from the [[Targaryen madness|Targaryen family's tendency towards insanity]], though he exhibited it much differently than others. Instead of being violent or paranoid, Baelor was obsessed with religion and pacifism, to the point of absurdity. Baelor earned the contempt of his nobles by forcing Lord Belgrave to wash the feet of a leper. He tried to replace all the [[raven]]s that delivered messages with doves, wore a crown made only of flowers, and once banished all [[prostitution|prostitutes]] from King's Landing. Baelor also confined his sisters Daena, Rhaena, and Elaena in the Maidenvault so they would not tempt him with carnal thoughts.

He also attempted to birth new dragons by praying over the dragon eggs, but his prayers went unanswered. Despite his zealous support of the Faith of the Seven, Baelor decided not to re-arm its old military orders, the [[Faith Militant]], as Baelor was a man of peace who believed the only weapon the faithful should have is prayer.

During his reign, he had a stonemason named as the [[High Septon]], a man that could carve stonework so beautifully that Baelor believed him to be the [[Smith]] in human form. While a fantastic stonecarver, the new High Septon could not read, write, or recite any prayers. Rumor spread that Baelor's Hand, his uncle [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]], had this High Septon poisoned to end the embarrassment to the realm. Baelor then raised a boy of eight years to High Septon, whom he claimed worked miracles, although the boy could not save the king's life on his deathbed. History says Baelor starved himself to death by prolonged fasting to cleanse himself of lust, but some believe he was poisoned by his Hand and uncle, Viserys; some who believe this have attempted to claim Viserys acted for the good of the realm, to stop Baelor, who had taken it into his head that the Seven wanted him to convert all of Westeros to their worship, from starting a war with the North and the Iron Islands. Baelor never consummated his marriage and therefore died childless, and was succeeded by his uncle.

The TV series made a slight change by stating that the boy whom Baelor named as High Septon was six years old, instead of eight years old as in the books.

Baelor was extremely popular with the smallfolk, due to his fanatical devotion to the religious virtues of charity. In later generations, he became remembered as "Baelor the Blessed" and revered as a saintly figure. Some educated members of the nobility (such as Tywin), however, think of him as a befuddled and overzealous fool who had a tenuous grip on reality.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', while Tyrion and [[Oberyn Martell]] argue about the contents of the book ''[[The Lives of Four Kings|Lives of Four Kings]]'', [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] interrupts, claiming that Baelor was a great king, since he walked the Boneway barefoot to make peace with Dorne, and rescued the Dragonknight from a snakepit, and that the vipers refused to strike him because he was so pure and holy. Oberyn scoffs that no viper would have bitten a bloodless stick like Baelor. [[Ellaria Sand]] also tells Sansa that contrary to the tales, Baelor was bitten a dozen times by the vipers and nearly died as a result, and infers the snake venom did little to reinforce Baelor's shaky grasp on reality. Tyrion adds that had Baelor died as a result, his uncle Viserys would have become King far sooner and Westeros would have been better for it.{{Bookref|ASOS|59}}
