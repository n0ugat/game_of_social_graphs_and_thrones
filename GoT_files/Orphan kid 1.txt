===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
The orphanage he is living at is visited by [[Margaery Tyrell]] as she passes through the streets of [[Flea Bottom]]. She talks to him about his parents and gives him a toy wooden knight to remember his father by. When he explains that his father was only a soldier not a knight, she says that his father did what knights swear to do and that he should be proud. She then promises to look after him and his fellow orphans.{{Ref|GOT301}}
