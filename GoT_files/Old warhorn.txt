An '''old warhorn'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is one of the objects found by [[Grenn]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] atop the [[Fist of the First Men]] during the [[great ranging]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The warhorn is found along with spear and arrow heads made of [[dragonglass]], all wrapped in the black cloak of a brother of the [[Night's Watch]]. Sam and Grenn do not take notice of the warhorn, as they are more interested in the rare dragonglass weapons.{{Ref|GOT208}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the warhorn and dragonglass cache are found by [[Jon Snow]] and [[Ghost]]. The warhorn is made from an auroch's horn and is banded with bronze. On closer examination the horn is cracked, and even after Jon cleans all the dirt out, he cannot get any sound from it. The rim is chipped as well, but Jon gives the horn to Sam anyway, since Sam likes to collect old things, even worthless ones. He tells Sam "Make a drinking horn out of it, and every time you take a drink you'll remember how you ranged beyond the [[Wall]], all the way to the Fist of the First Men". Sam carries the warhorn all the way from the Fist to [[Castle Black]], and from there to [[Oldtown]]; currently, by the point the books reached, the horn is still in his possession.

So far in the novels, there is nothing to indicate that the broken warhorn has any special properties. However, there is a fan theory that the seemingly useless warhorn is in fact the legendary Horn of Winter, used many years ago by the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]] [[Joramun]] to wake [[giants]] from the earth.
