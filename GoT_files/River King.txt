'''River King'''{{Ref|H&L306}} was the title held by an ancient, and now extinct, local dynasties that ruled over the [[Riverlands]]. The title is interchangeable with "[[King of the Rivers and Hills]]."

==History==
The River Kings were never very strong, because they were surrounded by enemies on all sides, bordering every other kingdom except for [[Dorne]], with no significant natural barriers against them. To the southeast, they faced the [[Storm King]]s of [[House Durrandon]]. To the southwest, they faced [[House Gardener]] from the [[Reach|Kingdom of the Reach]]. To the west, they faced [[House Lannister]] from the [[Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]]. To the northwest, they faced devastating raids by the [[Ironborn]] from the [[Iron Islands]]. To their east, they faced [[House Arryn]] from the [[Vale of Arryn|Kingdom of the Mountain and the Vale]]. Across the [[Neck]], they even faced the [[North|Kingdom of the North]] (though the kings of [[House Stark]] rarely advanced south of [[Moat Cailin]]).<ref>"[[House Tully (short)|House Tully]]"</ref><ref>"[[Riverrun (short)|Riverrun]]"</ref> The [[House Blackwood|Blackwoods]] once ruled as River Kings.<ref name="King">"[[King of the Narrow Sea (episode)|King of the Narrow Sea]]"</ref>

Over three centuries before [[Aegon's Conquest]], the River Kings were completely conquered by the [[Stormlands]], and House Durrandon extended its control all the way north to the [[Neck]].<ref>"[[The Stormlands]]"</ref>

About three generations before the Targaryen Conquest, however, the Riverlands were captured from the [[Storm King]]s by the Iron Islands, under King [[Harwyn Hoare]]. The Ironborn were even more brutal than the Storm Kings, reducing the Riverlanders to thralls and forcing them to build [[Harrenhal]] - yet no sooner was Harrenhal completed than the Targaryens invaded and killed Harwyn's grandson [[Harren Hoare]], along with all his sons. The Targaryens then raised up [[House Tully]] - who were unrelated to the old River Kings nor had ever been kings of any kind - to rule the region under them as [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|Lords Paramount of the Trident]].<ref>"[[House Tully (short)|House Tully]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, it isn't entirely clear if the "River Kings" ruled all of the Riverlands. At one time or another, [[House Mudd]], House Fisher, [[House Blackwood]], and [[House Bracken]] claimed to be kings. The Brackens claim that they were kings first (in the millennia-long, legendary past) but then the Blackwoods overthrew them, while the Blackwoods claim that it was the other way around. House Mudd was based around the [[Blue Fork]] of the [[Trident]], and was said to rule between the [[Neck]] and the Trident, but a large portion of the Riverlands extends south of the Trident. It also isn't clear if the Mudds managed to subdue the Blackwoods and Brackens, to the southwest along the [[Red Fork]] of the Trident). The upcoming ''World of Ice and Fire'' sourcebook should sort this out.

Based on George R.R. Martin's comments, it vaguely appears that House Fisher ruled first, but was defeated by the first great wave of [[ironborn]] expansion, one or two thousand years ago. House Mudd drove the ironborn out when this first era of expansion ended, but the Mudds were later conquered by the Storm Kings about 360 years before the Targaryen Conquest. Some three generations before the Targaryen Conquest, the ironborn entered their second great age of expansion under [[House Hoare]], who captured the Riverlands from the Storm Kings.
