==Narration==
'''Bronn''': ''Most boys dream of becoming a [[Kingsguard]]. Rich boys from good families get the chance. Smart boys stay at home and sing songs about them instead, opening purses and thighs, because the Kingsguard isn't really good for much else.''

''There was [[Criston Cole|one Kingsguard]] (I forgot the bastard's name) who swore an oath to his dying [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[Viserys I Targaryen|king]] to crown [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|his daughter]] after him. The very night that king died, this Kingsguard crowned the king's [[Aegon II Targaryen|son]] instead.''

''When an [[Lyman Beesbury|old man]] on the [[Small Council]] dared to protest, this honorable [[Knighthood|knight]] opened his throat. The bastard died in the very [[Dance of the Dragons|civil war]] he started along with the old king's son, daughter, and most of their [[dragon]]s.''

''And the Kingsguard? All that duty and honor and not enough brains to figure out which Targaryen to give it to. [[Arryk Cargyll|Twin]] [[Erryk Cargyll|brothers]] even ended up on opposite sides, died with tears on their cheeks as they cut each other down.''

''I suppose I should think that's tragic, but stupid men do stupid things every day and nobody cries over them.''

''Prince [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]] may be the most famous Kingsguard who ever lived. How did he die? Defending [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]] from the [[House Toyne|brothers]] of [[Terrence Toyne|a man]] whom Aegon fed to his [[dog]]s.''

''The man's crime? Sleeping with [[Bethany Bracken|one]] of the many mistresses Aegon wasn't using, and the man was one of Aegon's own Kingsguard.''

[[Arthur Dayne|''Arthur Dayne'']]'', [[Gerold Hightower]]. Sure, if half the stories about them are true, they could swing a sword better than most. Makes their lives even more of a waste. Bodyguards to the [[Aerys II Targaryen|maddest king]] the [[Seven Kingdoms]] ever saw.''

''Watching their king burn men alive. Standing guard as their king raped [[Rhaella Targaryen|his queen]]. Hiding the [[Lyanna Stark|Stark girl]] that Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|stole away]], causing a [[Robert's Rebellion|war]] that toppled their king. And all this without any gold or women to show for it.''

''Stupid buggers! The only one with any sense was [[Jaime Lannister]]. When [[Tywin Lannister|his father]] [[Sack of King's Landing|stormed]] [[King's Landing|the city]], he put a sword through the Mad King's back rather than die gloriously at his post. He's still here. They are not.''

''Even if the Kingsguard are the greatest knights in the realm, knights are just arses in armor. Riding whatever horse their daddies gave 'em. Putting on a white cloak does not make a man smarter of bolder.''

''It's just a pretty little curtain. Behind it is the same pile of shit.''
