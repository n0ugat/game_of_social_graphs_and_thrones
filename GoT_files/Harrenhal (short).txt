==Narration==
'''Catelyn Stark''': ''On the shores of the [[Gods Eye]], due north of the [[Isle of Faces]], rises a monument of arrogance and cruelty. [[Harrenhal]].''

''For a people who prided themselves on their ships, the [[Ironborn|Ironmen]] of old seized any chance to leave them and carved out a [[Riverlands|vast kingdom]] from the peaceful Riverlords. Their empire reached its zenith under King [[Harren Hoare]], called "the Black" by those he terrorized and by his own men, though they meant it proudly.''

''King Harren enslaved the [[Riverlands]] to raise the mightiest fortress [[Westeros]] had ever seen; a castle that could garrison a million men, with walls so vast that winters would come and go and besieging armies grow old and grey before the castle fell.''

''Five towers he ordered, reaching into the heavens like grasping fingers, a monstrosity which he forced our people to build for their own subjugation.''

''But the very day the slaves laid the last stone, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|his]] [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|sisters]] arrived in the south. When they arrived with their small army, Harren laughed and shut the gates.''

''Harrenhal would have its first test and an easy one at that. It failed.''

''Harrenhal could have survived all the armies in Westeros combined, but Harren learned that the tallest and thickest walls meant little to [[dragon]]s, for dragons fly.''

''With Harren and his sons dead, Harrenhal quickly surrendered to Aegon. [[House Tully]] then raised the Riverlords in rebellion against the [[Iron Islands]], and with Aegon, we flushed the Ironborn to the sea.''

''We should've torn down the castle stone by stone then, but Harrenhal seemed such a magnificent prize Aegon gave it to [[Quenton Qoherys|one]] of his commanders, whose [[House Qoherys|line]] then withered to extinction, as would every family to hold it thereafter.''

''When many speak of Harrenhal, their voices drop to whispers. About [[Danelle Lothston|Mad Lady Lothston]], who was said to send a giant bat to send children for her crock pots, and to bathe in blood and serve [[Cannibalism|feasts of human flesh]].''

''About the ghosts of Black Harren and his sons who still walk the castle at night, all aflame. Of the servants who went to bed in full health and were found in the morning burnt to ash.''

''Mere stories to frighten wayward children and excite young girls, you may say. You would not be entirely wrong.''

''Harrenhal is a prize. A nigh impregnable castle with enough land and enough income to make a man, at a stroke, one of the greatest lords in Westeros. But you would not be entirely right, either.''

''Say by a king's grace Harrenhal became yours. Now, you must garrison it. You must repair it and maintain it. Even stretched to the end of your means, you cannot fill and manage the whole castle.''

''So you would retreat your household to four of the five towers. Then three, then two, then only the bottom thirds of those. You close the Hall of a Hundred Hearths and take your meals in your rooms.''

''Even then, you can't shake the feeling of desolation; that Harrenhal and its vastness is devouring you. In later years, as you bury a grandson or a great-grandson, the last of your line, you will know it has.''

==Behind the scenes==
*During the brief montage when Catelyn explains that every House which ever held Harrenhal was struck by tragedy and went extinct, a montage shows a series of [[Heraldry]] banners burning away to signify the death of each of these houses. While the names aren't mentioned on-screen, these heraldry designs accurately correspond to the houses which held Harrenhal in the books, and even progress through the montage in chronological order: [[House Qoherys]], [[House Towers]], [[House Harroway]], [[House Strong]], and [[House Lothston]].
*The castle itself is held by [[House Whent]] at the beginning of the TV series, but the last living member was old Lady Shella Whent, whose children had all died. She surrended the castle to [[House Lannister]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]].<ref>Season 2 bluray: War of the Five Kings feature</ref> Catelyn's hypothetical - that a House would have to maintain only the bottom thirds of two of the five towers - is a literal description of what Lady Shella has had to do for some time.
*House Whent apparently only went extinct in the male line, however, as [[Minisa Tully]] (Catelyn's mother) was herself born a Whent, and thus Catelyn, Lysa, Edmure, and all of their respective children would technically have some claim to Harrenhal. However, because the Lannisters consider the Tullys and the Starks (Catelyn Tully's children) to be in rebellion against the crown, they opt to simply award the castle to [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish]] - who then marries Lysa.
*Catelyn's narration offers a perfectly rational explanation for all the houses who have held Harrenhal falling into ruin (a combination of economics and psychology), while at the same time ridiculing the common belief that curse is real. She does not, however, regard the other aspect of the alleged curse - the horrible fate of all the individuals who ever officiated as the castellans of the castle.
*According to this short, the Riverlords revolted against the Ironborn and sided with the Targaryens only after the fall of Harrenhal and death of Harren Hoare; according to the novels and the short "[[House Tully (short)|House Tully]]," however, the Riverlords revolted before the fall of Harrenhal, seeing Aegon Targaryen as a chance to overthrow the yoke of brutal Ironborn oppression.
