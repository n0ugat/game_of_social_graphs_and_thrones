Ser '''Jaremy Rykker'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is an officer in the rangers of the [[Night's Watch]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Ser Jaremy Rykker is an officer in the rangers of the Night's Watch. He is acting [[First Ranger]] when [[Benjen Stark]] is away from the [[Wall]].{{Ref|GOT107}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Ser Jaremy attends the induction of new recruits into the [[Night's Watch]]. He is the acting first ranger in the absence of [[Benjen Stark]], and summons the recruits assigned to the rangers after the [[Jeor Mormont|Lord Commander]]'s speech. He leads an escort for [[Jon Snow|Jon]] and [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] when they go [[Beyond the Wall|north of the Wall]] to take their vows in the [[Godswood]]. He embraces his newly sworn brothers after they take their vows. They discover the bodies of rangers [[Othor]] and [[Jafer Flowers]] near the Godswood and return them to [[Castle Black]]. The dead men had accompanied Benjen on his scouting mission beyond the Wall.{{Ref|GOT107}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Jaremy is an officer in the rangers of the [[Night's Watch]]. He attends the officers meeting with [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], and recalls being sent to the [[Wall]] by [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] after fighting for [[House Targaryen]] in the [[Sack of King's Landing]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]].{{Bookref|AGOT|21}} 

It is Ser Jaremy rather than Ser Alliser who challenges Sam about his decision to take his vows in the Godswood.{{Bookref|AGOT|48}} He does not participate in the escort to the Godswood. He identifies the bodies when they are returned to Castle Black.{{Bookref|AGOT|52}}

Ser Jaremy and four other men are killed by the wight [[Jafer Flowers]]. Jaremy manages to hack the wight's head off, but is killed when the headless corpse pulls his own dagger from its sheath and buries it in his bowels.{{Bookref|AGOT|60}}

Given that Ser Jaremy is not shown to be killed in the episode, it is possible that he simply wasn't killed in the TV continuity.
