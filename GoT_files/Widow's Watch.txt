'''Widow's Watch'''{{Ref|GOT402}} is a castle in the [[North]]. It is the seat of [[House Flint]] of Widow's Watch, a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. Widow's Watch is located on a peninsula extending into the northern mouth of the [[Bite]]. It is south-east of Winterfell.

==History==

Widow's Watch is seen on a map of the North that [[Roose Bolton]] has in the [[Dreadfort]], when he is pointing at [[Moat Cailin]] to the west.{{Ref|GOT402}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Widow's Watch is in the same location. It is the stronghold of arguably the more powerful of the two cadet branches of House Flint, the other branch being based at [[Flint's Finger]].
