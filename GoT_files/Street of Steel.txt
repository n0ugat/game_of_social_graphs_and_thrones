{{Quote|Without the Street of Steel, the king's armies would have no swords, armor, or victories.|[[Varys]]|King's Landing (short)}}
The '''Street of Steel'''{{Ref|GOT104}} is a street in [[King's Landing]] known for its smiths.<ref>"[[King's Landing (short)|King's Landing]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Street of Steel begins on the south west corner of Fishmonger's Square before travelling up Visenya's Hill to the [[Great Sept of Baelor]]. Many smiths set up shop their, with [[Tobho Mott]]'s shop located at the top due to it being the most expensive.

In ''The Sworn Sword'', Ser [[Duncan the Tall]] recalls seeing [[Brynden Rivers]] on the Street of Steel.

[[Jon Arryn]] and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] visit Tobho Mott's shop to meet [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] and verify that he is one of [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s [[bastard]]s, as does [[Eddard Stark]].

In ''A Clash of Kings'', [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] later commands the street's blacksmiths to build him a great chain, which he will later use in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].
