The '''Hall of a Thousand Thrones'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the seat of government in [[Qarth]] and the meeting place of the [[Thirteen]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Daenerys Targaryen]], accompanied by [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] and [[Kovarro]], meets with the Thirteen here after her [[dragon]]s are stolen, convinced that a member of the council perpetrated the deed.<ref>"[[A Man Without Honor]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Hall of a Thousand Thrones is the seat of power of the [[Pureborn]], the oligarch rulers of [[Qarth]]. Gaining access to the Hall and an audience with the Pureborn is a complicated process: To be allowed entrance, petitioners must make the traditional sacrifice in the Temple of Memory, offer the traditional bribe to the Keeper of the Long List, and send the traditional persimmon to the Opener of the Door. Finally, the petitioner will receive the traditional blue silk slippers summoning him or her to the Hall of a Thousand Thrones.

Inside, the Pureborn sit on great wooden chairs of their ancestors, which rise in curved tiers from a marble floor to a high domed ceiling. The chairs are immense, fantastically carved, bright with gold work, and studded with amber, onyx, lapis and jade. Each one is different from all the others, and each one strives to be the most fabulous. The domed ceiling is painted with scenes of Qarth's vanquished glory.
