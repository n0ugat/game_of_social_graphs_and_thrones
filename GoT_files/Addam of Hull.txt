{{Quote|I have sweated blood in service of House Velaryon. I may appear lowborn, but I know much and more of service. And if the gods call me to greater things, who am I to refuse them?|Addam of Hull|The Red Sowing}}
'''Addam of Hull''' is a [[bastard]] son of Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]] and the [[Dragonrider|rider]] of the [[dragon]] [[Seasmoke]]. He previously worked as a shipwright for the [[Velaryon fleet]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Addam and his brother [[Alyn of Hull|Alyn]] are from [[Hull]], a town on [[Driftmark]].{{Ref|HOTD207}} He and Alyn are [[bastard]] sons of Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]].{{Ref|HOTD206}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
While reporting to [[Corlys Velaryon]] about the [[blockade of the Gullet]] and the repairs on his ship, the ''[[Queen Who Never Was|Sea Snake]]'', Alyn says that he will talk with Addam to try and recruit more shipwrights.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Addam is called to [[Spicetown]] with a dozen other shipwrights from Hull to accelerate the repairs of the Velaryon fleet. There, he reunites with his brother. Addam and Alyn hug one another and start talking about Alyn's adventures and what's for dinner. Addam says he heard that Lord Corlys personally commended Alyn for his service, and encourages him to join the crew of the ''Sea Snake'' in the hope that he will make a fortune and a name for himself. However, Alyn is reluctant since he knows that a [[Dance of the Dragons|bloody war]] is near.{{Ref|HOTD202}}[[File:2x2 Addam and Alyn Still.jpg|thumb|Addam and [[Alyn of Hull|Alyn]] reunite.]]Later while foraging for crabs and clams on the beaches of Driftmark, Addam witnesses the dragon [[Seasmoke]] flying overhead.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Addam is at the Spicetown shipyard, helping the crew of the Sea Snake repair the ship, when Lord Corlys arrives to visit Alyn. Addam overhears the conversation between his father and his brother. Corlys offers Alyn the position of first officer of the ship, but doesn't notice Addam.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Back at home in Hull, Addam watches his brother shave his head to hide his Velaryon ancestry. Addam criticizes this action, stating that he isn't fooling anyone by trying to pretend that he isn't the Corlys' bastard. Addam instead encourages his brother to accept the position offered by their father, suggesting that Corlys could recognize him as his son and name him heir to [[Driftmark]]. Addam laments how he, on the other hand, is ignored by their father. However, Alyn tells Addam that their father would rather see [[House Velaryon]] become extinct than acknowledge them as his bastards. When his brother refuses, Addam leaves.{{Ref|HOTD206}}
[[File:2x7 Rhaenyra and Addam Still 2.jpg|thumb|Addam swearing fealty to Rhaenyra.]]
Addam is about to go fishing on a beach in Driftmark when the dragon Seasmoke flies over him. He initially appears to walk away, but the dragon turns toward the people on the beach, causing them to panic. When the dragon chases after Addam, he runs into the forest, losing sight of the flying beast. While running through the forest, he trips and falls. Addam looks up at the sky and relaxes when the dragon seems to be gone, when suddenly Seasmoke lands in front of him corners him against a mound.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Hours later, on [[Dragonstone]], [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] is informed by Ser [[Lorent Marbrand]] that Seasmoke was spotted flying over Spicetown with a rider.{{Ref|HOTD206}} Rhaenyra mounts [[Syrax]] and flies to a beach on Spicetown to confront Seasmoke's rumored rider, Addam himself. Addam, however, tells Rhaenyra that he had no intention of claiming Seasmoke, before [[Bending the knee|bending the knee]] to her and declaring her the queen. Addam then offers his service to Rhaenyra, hoping to learn the ways of [[Dragonrider|dragonriding]], which she accepts.{{Ref|HOTD207}}
[[File:S2 Rhaenyra Jace Baela and Dragonseeds.png|thumb]]
Addam flies with Rhaenyra back to Dragonstone, where he is given his own chambers. Corlys visits Addam, where he comments on his rise. Addam formally asks to leave his service, which Corlys grants. He then congratulates Addam shortly before leaving. Addam later stands by Rhaenyra's side as she presides over the [[Red Sowing]].{{Ref|HOTD207}}

==Personality==
Addam is a man who craves the opportunity for fortune and glory, while believing that he and his brother Alyn are deserving of a higher standard of living, due to their status as the sons of the Sea Snake.{{Ref|HOTD202}}{{Ref|HOTD206}} Although he loves his brother,{{Ref|HOTD202}} he is also envious of him, since his father, Corlys Velaryon, notices Alyn while ignoring Addam himself.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==Behind the scenes==
On December 2, 2023, [[HBO]] announced that [[Clinton Liberty]] had been cast in the role of Addam of Hull for [[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]].{{Webref|name=WBD |author=HBO |date=December 2, 2023 |url=https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/house-dragon/hbo-releases-official-teaser-and-first-look-images-season-two-original-drama-series |title=HBO Releases Official Teaser And First Look Images For Season Two Of Original Drama Series HOUSE OF THE DRAGON |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=December 17, 2023 }} His character description reads as follows:
:''"A shipwright for the Velaryon fleet and Alyn’s brother."''<ref name="WBD2" />

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Addam was a [[bastard]] son of Marilda of Hull, and older brother of Alyn of Hull. He was born in 114 AC, a year before his brother. He and Alyn grew up in their maternal grandfather's shipyard and served on the trading cog ''Mouse''.{{Bookref|F&B|15}}

No one doubted that Addam and his brother were [[dragonseed]]s, since both had a silvery hair and purple eyes. According to their mother, their father was [[Laenor Velaryon]]; they looked like him, but the claim was questionable in view of Laenor's sexual preference. Grand Maester [[Munkun]] and Septon [[Eustace]] both dutifully asserted that Laenor was the father, but the court jester Mushroom claimed the father was Corlys.

Addam never worked as a shipwright for the [[Velaryon fleet]].
