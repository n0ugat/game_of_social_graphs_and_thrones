{{Quote|This is the bravo's dance, the water dance. It is swift... and sudden!|[[Syrio Forel]]|Lord Snow}}
A '''bravo'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is a swordsman of the [[Free Cities]]. Unlike [[Westeros]]i [[Knighthood|knights]], bravos practice a swifter style of swordsmanship known as the [[water dance]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, bravos are highly skilled swordsmen that prowl the city of Braavos during the night. They dress in brightly colored finery and actively seek out fights to prove their skills. Wielding slender, sharply pointed swords, most will fight with little cause - such as a man's opinion on who is the city's most beautiful courtesan - and some with no cause at all. Anyone carrying a sword after dark in Braavos can be challenged to a duel. Simply placing a finger on one's sword while facing a bravo is akin to challenging them.
