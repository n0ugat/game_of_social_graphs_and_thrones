King '''Hugor of the Hill''' was the legendary first king of the [[Andal]] people.

==Biography==
[[File:HL5 Seven Pointed Star the Seven with the Mother.png|thumb|The Seven crown Hugor and present him with his bride.]]
According to legend, in ancient times the [[Seven]] gods walked the earth among men, and they blessed Hugor of the Hill, king of the Andal people. The [[Father]] pulled down seven stars from the heavens and set them upon the brow of Hugor to make a glowing crown. The [[Maiden]] then brought him a girl as supple as willow, with eyes like deep pools, whom Hugor declared he would take as his bride. The [[Mother]] made her fertile, and the [[Crone]] foretold that she would give him forty-four mighty sons. The [[Warrior]] gave strength to their arms, and the [[Smith]] made a suit of iron plates for both of them.{{Ref|H&L501}} The gods crowned him as king of the Andal people, and promised him that his people would one day rule great kingdoms in a foreign continent.{{Ref|H&L502}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Hugor's story is the same. It is unclear exactly when he is supposed to have lived, though apparently it was some time before the [[coming of the Andals]] began (the histories don't mention him in [[Westeros]] itself). Due to his legendary status it is unknown if a single king named "Hugor" ever truly existed (much less if he actually met gods), just as among the [[First Men]] it is unclear if figures such as [[Durran Godsgrief]] ever truly lived and warred against gods of the sea and sky.

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', one of the assumed names [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] uses is Hugor Hill ("Hill" is the bastard surname used in the [[Westerlands]]). Tyrion uses this name during the journey east from [[Pentos]] through [[Andalos]] - thinking to himself on how the legendary Hugor allegedly lived there, and pondering how his own [[Andals|Andal]] ancestors once walked the same lands he is now crossing through.{{Bookref|ADWD|8}}
