'''Joffrey Baratheon's crossbow''' is a specialized [[Armament#Ranged weapons: bows and crossbows|crossbow]] that requires little effort to reload. It is currently owned by [[Bronn]]. It was commissioned by [[Joffrey Baratheon]]. It has a golden lion, the sigil of [[House Lannister]], on the prod and is ornately decorated.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[File:Main-qimg-a9b79c9b47eef57ff3345250c443eb30.jpeg|thumb|Joffrey and Margaery practice with the crossbow.]]
Before leaving on a hunting trip, Joffrey summons [[Margaery Tyrell|Margaery]] to his chambers. As she enters, he is holding his new crossbow. He asks if she likes it, and boasts that it is one of the finest weapons in [[Westeros]]. She asks to be shown how it works, and he explains that it is recocked with a lever instead of a crank, much easier and faster than a regular crossbow. After loading, he shoots a bolt through the eyes of a wall-mounted boar's head, displaying that he has some skill with it. He then lets her hold the crossbow, and she manipulates him by humoring his sadistic tastes.<ref>"[[Dark Wings, Dark Words]]"</ref>

When [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] discovers that [[Ros]] has been [[Little birds|spying]] on him for [[Varys]], he turns her over to Joffrey, who kills her with the crossbow.<ref>"[[The Climb]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[File:Tyrionfindtywinprivey.jpg|thumb|Tyrion confronts Tywin.]]
After escaping from the [[Black Cells]] (and hence [[execution]] for Joffrey's murder), [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] steals the crossbow from the [[Tower of the Hand]]. After murdering [[Shae]], he finds his father [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] in a privy, and [[Assassinations in the Tower of the Hand|kills]] him with two cross-bolts (one to the stomach and a final, fatal bolt to the heart), after dismissing Shae as a [[Prostitution|whore]]. As Tyrion walks away, he drops the crossbow onto the floor of the corridor.<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
[[File:GoT Bronn crossbow Winterfell Ep s8.jpg|thumb|Bronn is given the crossbow.]]
On [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s orders, [[Qyburn]] gives the crossbow to [[Bronn]] to poetically [[assassin]]ate Tyrion and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], with the promise of [[lordship]] over [[Riverrun]].<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

Bronn finds Tyrion and Jaime in the [[winter town]], intending to kill them with the crossbow. He fires a warning shot at Jaime when he tries to call his bluff. However, when Tyrion promises Bronn [[Highgarden]], which is much more valuable than Riverrun, he lets them live and leaves.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Joffrey occasionally uses a crossbow to shoot at animals (hares, cats) and people. In contrast to his depiction in the show, he is utterly inept with the weapon; Tyrion and [[Littlefinger]] briefly watch him shoot at hares in the Red Keep's courtyard, where his aim is so poor that he almost shoots Ser [[Preston Greenfield]] of the [[Kingsguard]] in the groin, prompting Littlefinger to quip that the hares are winning the battle.{{Bookref|ACOK|17}}

Tyrion gives Joffrey an ungainly Myrish crossbow that can shoot three quarrels at a time, just to rid himself of Joffrey. Joffrey uses it to frighten Sansa, boasting that he shot at people who came begging for food, hitting the loudest man right through the throat, and injuring a woman in the arm. He tells Sansa he'd shoot her too, but that would cost Jaime's life, so he "just" orders [[Meryn Trant|his]] [[Boros Blount|guards]] to beat her up.

There is no indication that Tyrion uses the same crossbow to kill his father. The book makes a point that crossbow cannot be reloaded so easily and quickly as Tyrion does in the show. Tyrion, overhearing two of his father's guards arguing outside as he sneaks into the Tower of the Hand, notes that if they discovered him, he'd only be able to kill one.{{Bookref|ASOS|77}}
