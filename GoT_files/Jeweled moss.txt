'''Jeweled moss'''<ref>[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref> is a plant native to the [[Valyrian peninsula]]. Its spores are described as having erupted from stalked capsules. If not pruned once a month, the moss would cover the glass windows of [[Jaehaelor Mataeryon]]'s gardens. Jaehaelor likened its scent to that of [[Meraxes's Scepter]]; more specifically, he said: "''the stench is so sour it flames the stinging hairs of my nettles.''"

==In the books==
