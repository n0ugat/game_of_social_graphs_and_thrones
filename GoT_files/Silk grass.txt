'''Silk grass'''<ref name="Dedalvs">[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref> is a plant native to the [[Valyrian peninsula]].

==Uses==
According to [[Jaehaelor Mataeryon]], silk grass was used as garnishment in most Valyrian cuisine eaten by [[dragonlord]]s and their kin; [[Slavery|slaves]], on the other hand, were forbidden from consuming the plant. On one occasion, Jaehaelor claims to have caught a bedslave named [[Narha]] nibbling on silk grass, and was forced to slit her wrists with his [[Valyrian steel]] blade for the crime.<ref name="Dedalvs" />

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and their supplementary material, there is no mention of silk grass.
