In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' he is playing the role of [[Podrick Payne]]. He was announced in the role on 24 August 2011.<ref>[http://www.accesshollywood.com/_article_52588 Access Hollywood]</ref> He joined the cast as a guest star in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]].

After getting hooked on the TV series after Season 1, Portman read the entire novel series. Subsequently he was cast as Podrick starting in Season 2. In the books, Podrick does appear in the first novel, being introduced in the Lannister army camp prior to the [[battle on the Green Fork]] (corresponding to the episode "[[Baelor]]"). Podrick's first on-screen appearance was pushed back to the beginning of Season 2, though his background may not have been changed - in that he might simply have been "off-screen" in the Lannister camp during Season 1.

Daniel's father, [[Ron Donachie]] also appeared on the series as [[Rodrik Cassel]] in [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] and [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]].<ref>[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/50-things-season-2-pt-2 Making Game of Thrones blog]</ref>
