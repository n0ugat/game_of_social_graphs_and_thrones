{{Quote|Jaime smashed the Riverlords at the Golden Tooth, and now lays siege to Riverrun.|Ser [[Kevan Lannister]]|The Pointy End}}
A '''battle in the hills below the Golden Tooth'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was the opening battle in the [[War of the Five Kings]], which erupted after the death of King [[Robert Baratheon]].

==History==
===Background===
Leading a host of 30,000 troops from the [[Westerlands]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is ordered to attack the [[Riverlands]] by his father. The assault is intended as retribution for the abduction of [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] by [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], a daughter of [[House Tully]], the ruling house of the Riverlands.{{Ref|GOT107}}

===The battle===
The Riverlords gather to defend themselves at the [[Golden Tooth]], where they are defeated by Jaime's forces, and retreat to the regional capital of [[Riverrun]]. Jaime harries their retreat and then lays [[Siege of Riverrun|siege]] to Riverrun.{{Ref|GOT108}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the battle of Golden Tooth is fought between Jaime's forces and a force of Riverlords led by Lord Clement Piper and Lord Vance of Wayfarer's Rest. The Riverlords had been sent into the Westerlands at Golden Tooth by [[Edmure Tully]] to prevent the Lannister army from crossing into their lands. However, the battle was a failure in the face of Jaime's devastating attack. Lord Vance is killed and Lord Piper retreats to Riverrun with Jaime at his heels.
