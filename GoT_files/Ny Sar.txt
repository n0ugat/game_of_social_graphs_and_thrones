'''Ny Sar'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a ruined city in [[Essos]]. It was the capital of the [[Rhoynar]] before they were forced to flee to [[Dorne]] by the [[Valyrians]]. The city was destroyed by the Valyrians. It sits at the confluence of the [[Rhoyne]] and the river Noyne.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ny Sar was ruled by Princess [[Nymeria]] before the defeat of the allied Rhoynar city-states by the Valyrians. After their armies were defeated, Nymeria led an exodus of her people from all the lands of the Rhoynar, fleeing into the [[Summer Sea]] and thence to [[Westeros]], where they landed in [[Dorne]] and allied with [[House Martell]], helping them become the dominant power in the region.
