He visits [[Littlefinger's brothel]] with his friend. While they're singing the "[[The Rains of Castamere]]," they are confronted by [[Oberyn Martell]], who threatens Morgan. Morgan reaches for his sword, but Oberyn thrusts a dagger through his palm, pinning it to the table. As [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] and [[Bronn]] enter, Oberyn releases Morgan's hand, then he and his friend quickly leave.{{Ref|GOT401}}
