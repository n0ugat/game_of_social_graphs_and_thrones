{{Quote|Sunfyre - Said to be the most beautiful creature to command the airs.|[[Munkun]]|The Dance of Dragons}}
'''Sunfyre''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: {{HV|Sun}}{{HV|Fire}} ''Vēsperzys''}} also known as '''Sunfyre the Golden''',{{Guideref|Sunfyre}} was a [[dragon]] bred by [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]]. He was bonded to [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon II Targaryen]] and the third dragon to die during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Sunfyre is said to be the most eye-catching of the dragons. He has golden scales that glisten in the sunlight,{{Guideref|Sunfyre}} pink wings,{{Ref|HOTD107}} amber eyes, and orange frills on his neck and body.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Sunfyre Driftmark.jpeg|thumb|Sunfyre at Driftmark for the funeral of Laena Velaryon]]
Sunfyre stays at [[High Tide]] along with several other dragons during the funeral of [[Laena Velaryon]]. The next day, he flies back to [[King's Landing]] with [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] riding him.{{Ref|HOTD107}}[[File:OT2 Aegon & Sunfyre.png|thumb|[[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]] rides Sunfyre into [[Battle at Rook's Rest]].]]
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:Sunfyre injured.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Sunfyre lies dying after the Battle at Rook's Rest.]]
Sunfyre nuzzles Aegon in the [[Dragonpit]] before they fly from [[King's Landing]] to [[Rook's Rest]] to join the ensuing [[Battle at Rook's Rest|battle]]. Upon sighting him and his dragon, Ser [[Criston Cole]] declares to his men that the King himself is joining them on the battlefield. Aemond spots the golden dragon and issues Vhagar to wait before engaging in the battle. Upon spotting [[Meleys]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] attacking Cole's army, Aegon commands Sunfyre to blast them with his fire breath, after which a fierce aerial melee ensues. After being brutally slashed in the chest by Meleys's claws, Sunfyre briefly breaks free, dousing many of the Green soldiers below with his spilled, smoking blood before almost immediately being attacked by the larger dragon once more. As Meleys clamps her jaws around Sunfyre's right wing, the golden dragon bites off one of her horns in return. When [[Vhagar]] and [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] enter the fray, the young prince commands Vhagar to blast both Sunfyre and Meleys with her fire breath. The blast of Vhagar's flames sets fire to both of Sunfyre's wings, causing him along with Aegon to plummet and crash into a nearby forest. Sunfyre and Aegon survive the fall, but both are severely injured, with Sunfyre instinctively protecting Aegon by coiling around him even in such a wounded state.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Upon returning to King's Landing, Criston informs [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] that a garrison of men was left to occupy Rook's Rest as well as to look after Sunfyre, who was left behind due to his severe injuries, and that there is little chance of him recovering from his wounds. [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] and Aegon assume that Sunfyre has been slain.{{Ref|HOTD205}}{{Ref|HOTD208}}
==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Sunfyre's egg hatched at the [[Dragonmont]]. He had shining gold scales and pale pink wing membranes, and he breathed golden fire. He was, according to Archmaester Gyldayn, the most beautiful dragon in recorded history: his scales were not just similar to a golden yellow, but literally looked like gold metal shining in the sunlight. Sunfyre was a young adult dragon by the time of the [[Dance of the Dragons|Dance]], older than [[Vermax]] and Tessarion but still younger than some of the blacks' dragons, like [[Syrax]] and [[Meleys]]. Despite his relative youth, he quickly grew to be quite strong and formidable.

Aegon II took a golden three-headed dragon as his personal sigil to honor Sunfyre.

Sunfyre was severely harmed at the [[Battle at Rook's Rest]]; one of his wings was half torn from his body, thus could not fly. He could still resist the attempts to kill him, but never fully recovered.
