Lord '''Selwyn Tarth''' is the head of [[House Tarth]] and the father of [[Brienne of Tarth]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Selwyn Tarth is the head of [[House Tarth]], a vassal house of [[House Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]]. He is the ruler of [[Tarth]], an island located in [[Shipbreaker Bay]] in the [[Stormlands]]. He trained his daughter [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] to be an accomplished warrior. After the outbreak of the [[War of the Five Kings]], Lord Selwyn declared for [[Renly Baratheon]] and sent Brienne to join his army.{{Ref|GOT203}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
After Brienne defeats [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]] in single combat, King Renly is impressed by the warrior-woman's prowess and states that she is everything her father said she was and more.{{Ref|GOT203}} When [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] meets Brienne for the first time, he spends a moment trying to recall Tarth, then remembers that its lord is her father, Selwyn of House Tarth.{{Ref|GOT208}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
When the captured Brienne is about to be raped by [[Locke]] and then by his men, Jaime successfully stops them by promising Lord Selwyn would pay a high ransom for his only surviving child's return, but only if Brienne's honor remains "unbesmirched." Jaime tells Locke that Tarth is famous as "the Sapphire Isle" because it is the location of all sapphire mines in Westeros, and Lord Selwyn will give him Brienne's weight in sapphires for her release. Locke agrees and calls off his men before they can rape Brienne.{{Ref|GOT303}}

Brienne subsequently points out to Jaime in private that Tarth is called "the Sapphire Isle" because of the blue of the surrounding waters - there are no sapphire gemstones. She realizes Jaime must have known this, but embellished her father's wealth in order to convince Locke to leave her unharmed.{{Ref|GOT304}}

Lord Selwyn responds to Locke's ransom demand via [[raven]], offering a ransom of three hundred [[Money|gold dragons]] in exchange for Brienne's release. Unfortunately, Locke became so convinced by Jaime's previous spur of the moment lie to save Brienne that he refuses Selwyn's offer, and will settle for nothing less than literally Brienne's weight in sapphire gemstones. Selwyn's messages insist there are no sapphires on Tarth but Locke simply thinks he is refusing to pay. Locke and his men decide to entertain themselves by putting Brienne into [[Harrenhal]]'s bear pit, but she is saved by Jaime's intervention.{{Ref|GOT307}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] tells Brienne at [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's wedding]] that as "Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter, that makes you a lady whether you want to be or not".{{Ref|GOT402}}

Brienne mentions her father when she encounters [[Arya Stark|Arya]]. She reminisces how Lord Selwyn told her that it was not proper behavior for a lady to pursue martial activity. However, Brienne did not listen and continued fighting other boys until her father relented and personally trained her as a warrior.{{Ref|GOT410}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Brienne recounts to [[Podrick Payne]] how her father held a ball for her and invited dozens of young highborn suitors.{{Ref|GOT503}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
At [[Riverrun]], Brienne mentions who she is a second time while attempting to convince [[Brynden Tully]] to join [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] in the [[North]]. He cuts her off, stating that he knows and admires her father.{{Ref|GOT608}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Selwyn Tarth is described as a good man of fifty-four years old. Also known as "The Evenstar", he is a widower remembered by Brienne as having a new woman every year. 

Lord Selwyn initially declares House Tarth's support for Renly; after Renly's death, it isn't clearly stated whom he supports. He certainly does not send any troops to aid Stannis, but it's unclear if he bends the knee to Joffrey, outright lends his support to him, or simply adopts an isolationist stance, like Lord Gulian Swann.
