'''Eglantine'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was the [[septa]] of Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Eglantine is a [[septa]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. She serves at the [[Red Keep]] in [[King's Landing]] as governess and companion to Princess [[Myrcella Baratheon]].{{Ref|GOT201}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Eglantine is among the royal entourage for a tourney to celebrate [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s [[nameday]].{{Ref|GOT201}}

[[File:Myrcella leaves.jpg|thumb|Eglantine accompanies Myrcella on her journey.]]
Eglantine later watches over Myrcella as she plays blind man's bluff with two courtiers{{Ref|GOT205}} before accompanying her to [[Sunspear]], as part of the betrothal arranged by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to Prince [[Trystane Martell]].{{Ref|GOT206}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
While Myrcella makes her way back to King's Landing from Sunspear and dies on the way from poisoning, it is likely that Eglantine accompanies her.{{Ref|GOT510}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Assuming that Eglantine returned to the Red Keep after Myrcella's death, it is likely she is killed along with most of the royal household when [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] and her troops [[Battle of King's Landing|destroy the city]].{{Ref|GOT805}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Septa Eglantine is a loyal servant of the royal family and Princess Myrcella Baratheon. 

Similarly to the show, she accompanies Myrcella as a member of her retinue when she is sent to [[Dorne]] as part of the marriage alliance with [[House Martell]]. On the way, Eglantine puts brown dye in Myrcella's hair; she says it is a game, but Myrcella knows it is meant to protect her, in case [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] captures the ship.
