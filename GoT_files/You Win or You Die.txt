==Synopsis==
=== At the Lannister camp ===
[[Image:Lannister camp.jpg|thumb|The [[House Lannister|Lannister]] army, poised to invade the [[Riverlands]].]]
On the borders of the [[Riverlands]], Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] has assembled an army of sixty thousand men, with which he plans to oppose the [[House Stark|Starks]] and punish [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]]'s [[First trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|capture]] of his son [[Tyrion Lannister]].

[[Image:Tywin and Jaime.jpg|thumb|Tywin discusses the future of House Lannister with his son Jaime.]]
As he stands in his tent skinning a dead stag, he tells his elder son, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], that this conflict will decide the fate of their family; they will either forge a dynasty that will last a thousand years or cease to exist, as the Targaryens had done. He orders Jaime to become the man he was meant to be, and to take thirty thousand men and besiege [[Riverrun]], Catelyn's childhood home and the seat of [[House Tully]]. Jaime ponders why Tywin would risk so much for the ugly, stunted son that he hates, but to Tywin a Lannister is a Lannister - even though he considers Tyrion the least worthy member of their family, any affront to their family must be punished or it makes them look weak.

=== At Winterfell ===
[[Image:Theon and Osha.jpg|thumb|Theon attempts to intimidate Osha.]]
In [[Winterfell]], [[Theon Greyjoy]] attempts to bully [[Osha]], the [[Free Folk|wildling]] woman captured in the recent raid. He insists that she refer to him as "My Lord", but she is unimpressed with his antics. She points out that he is not entitled to this, as his father is still alive. [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Luwin]] dismisses Theon and questions Osha about why her band crossed the [[Wall]] and were fleeing "as far south as south goes". She claims that the [[White Walkers]] have awoken after a millennia asleep and are coming south, to Luwin's skepticism.

=== At the Wall ===
[[Jon Snow]] and [[Samwell Tarly]] are standing watch atop the Wall when [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]]'s horse is spotted returning, but, to Jon's horror, there is no sign of Benjen himself.

Later on, Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] names the trainees as men of the [[Night's Watch]]. He hands out assignments, but to Jon's disgust he is being sent to the [[Steward (Night's Watch)|stewards]], not the [[Ranger|rangers]]. He will work directly for the Lord Commander as his personal steward. His attempts to plead his case to Maester [[Aemon]] (who has selected Sam as his own steward) are met with indifference. However, Sam suggests to Jon that while this move was possibly orchestrated by Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] to punish Jon, it is also an opportunity for the Lord Commander to groom Jon directly for command. Both are surprised when [[Pypar]] admits that he was sent to the Watch for refusing to give sexual favors to a lord, not for stealing a wheel of cheese to feed his sister as he had previously claimed. Nothing about being sent to the Wall is fair.

[[Image:Jon and Sam oaths.jpg|thumb|Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly swear their oaths to the Night's Watch.]]

Convinced, Jon, as a worshiper of the [[Old Gods]], is allowed to say his oath of fealty to the Night's Watch in front of a [[heart tree]] just inside the eaves of the [[Haunted Forest]]. Sam decides to take the oath with Jon, as [[Faith of the Seven|the Seven]] gods his father worshiped have never seemed to answer him. Accompanied by [[Othell Yarwyck]] and three more brothers of the Watch, Sam and Jon take their oaths, then they are acknowledged by the others as members of the Watch. [[Ghost]] finds a severed hand in the woods and brings it back to Jon and a horrified Sam.

=== In Vaes Dothrak ===
[[Image:Drogo and Dany.jpg|thumb|Daenerys tries to convince Drogo to invade Westeros.]]
In [[Vaes Dothrak]], Daenerys attempts to convince [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] about the benefits of an invasion of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], but Drogo is reluctant to cross the [[Narrow Sea]], despite the thousands of [[ships]] they could find in the [[Free Cities]] to do the job. He says that a man doesn't need an "[[Iron Throne|iron chair]]" but only a [[horse]]. Daenerys travels to the marketplace with Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] and her handmaidens. She asks Jorah to help convince her husband since the [[Seven Kingdoms]] are hers by birthright, but he reminds her that her ancestor [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] took six of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] because he was capable of doing so with [[dragon]]s. A [[Little bird (You Win or You Die)|little bird]] gives Jorah a message from Varys, a royal pardon for his crimes; he quickly realizes that this news would only come if he was no longer needed as a spy. Seeing Daenerys with a [[wineseller]] who is keen for her to try a particular vintage from the [[Arbor]], Jorah realizes that the wine has been poisoned; this is the assassination attempt. Having second thoughts, he steps in and stops Daenerys from drinking it. The wineseller attempts to flee, but [[Rakharo]] brings him down by tangling his ankles with his whip.
[[Image:Wineseller captured.jpg|thumb|The wine seller is captured after trying to poison Daenerys.]]
With the wine seller captured, Ser Jorah tells Daenerys that Robert Baratheon will never stop trying to kill her and her future children. Drogo quickly arrives in the tent. He glares at the seller and then goes to Daenerys to ensure she is okay, before offering Jorah the reward of any horse he chooses for foiling the assassination. Enraged, he begins to yell out in [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]] that his army will cross the "[[Narrow Sea|poison water]]" as no khalasar has done before and take the Iron Throne for [[Rhaego|his son]]. Drogo's khalasar departs [[Vaes Dothrak]] the next morning, with the wine seller tied naked to the saddle of Daenerys' horse, forced to walk until he eventually falls of exhaustion and is dragged to his death.

=== In King's Landing ===
Lord [[Eddard Stark]] meets with [[Cersei Lannister]]. He tells her that he knows the secret that [[Jon Arryn]] died for: that Cersei's three children are not [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]]'s, but the product of [[incest]] between her and Jaime. Cersei does not deny the charge and in fact is proud of it, comparing their love to the old [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] practice of marrying brother to sister; she also admits to having despised Robert ever since their wedding night, when Robert drunkenly stumbled into Cersei's bed and called her ''"[[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]]"''. Eddard angrily tells her to take her children and leave the city immediately. When Robert returns from his hunt, he will tell him the truth of the matter and Cersei should run as far as she can before that happens, lest Robert's wrath find her. 
Cersei icily calls Ned a fool for turning down the throne himself after the [[sack of King's Landing]]. Eddard tells her that he has regrets, but that isn't one of them. Cersei departs with a chilling warning: "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground."
[[Image:Robert's last act.jpg|thumb|Robert Baratheon signs a document confirming Eddard Stark as Protector of the Realm.]]
In one of his brothels, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] instructs the newly-arrived [[Ros]] and another prostitute, [[Armeca]], on how to please their customers and make them happy. When they ask him to join them, he refuses, saying that he only ever had eyes for one woman. He tells them about his past, how he loved and fought a duel for a [[Catelyn Stark|woman]]. He lost and subsequently realized that he could never beat those in power by honorable means, as they would never let him compete on equal terms. When Ros asks him what he wants, he says, "Oh, everything."       

In the Red Keep, a blood-stained and shaken [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] finds Eddard and tells him that Robert has been badly mauled by a boar and is not expected to survive. Eddard finds Robert telling [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] that he wishes he could have been a better father to him. Eddard chooses not to tell Robert about his discoveries to spare his final hours from pain. Robert instructs Eddard to make a letter naming him as the Lord Protector of the Realm, to rule until Joffrey comes of age. Eddard does not write Joffrey's name, instead saying "the rightful heir". Robert also asks him to cancel the attempt on [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s life.

Leaving the chamber, Eddard talks to [[Varys]] and Ser [[Barristan Selmy]]; Selmy laments that Robert insisted the others stand aside to let him take on the boar alone and blames himself for failing in his duty, though Ned gently reassures Barristan no one could protect Robert from himself. By asking Selmy a seemingly-innocent question about the wine, Varys slyly points out that [[Lancel Lannister]] ensured the King kept "refreshed" with alcohol during the hunt, meaning his reactions were slowed and unreliable. Varys also says it is far too late to stop the attempt on Daenerys' life.        
[[Image:Eddard's letter.jpg|thumb|The letter Ned sends to Stannis Baratheon, informing him of his findings.]]

At King's Landing, Renly confronts Eddard and offers him a hundred swords to take Joffrey into custody, insisting that any delay will only serve Cersei's schemes, but Eddard refuses to dishonor Robert's last hours by shedding blood in the [[Red Keep]] and taking frightened children hostage. Renly suggests that he could make a good king, but Eddard angrily points out that [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] is Renly's older brother and the true heir. In his study he writes a letter laying out his findings to Lord Stannis and instructs a [[Tomard|courier]] to take the message to [[Dragonstone]], Stannis's island fortress. Littlefinger then arrives and talks to Eddard, who tells him the truth about Joffrey's parentage. Littlefinger suggests that they keep quiet, acknowledge Joffrey as king and make him their puppet. If he proves intractable, they can reveal the truth and crown the more malleable Renly instead. Eddard considers this treason. Littlefinger realizes that even though Lord Eddard has Robert's edict naming him [[Regent]] and [[Protector of the Realm]], he doesn't have the men he needs to seize control from Cersei. He needs the loyalty of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]], as only their numbers can give him the force to overwhelm Cersei's loyalists. Littlefinger understands that the honorable Eddard Stark can't come right out and ask him to bribe them, but agrees to do what needs to be done.
[[file:Cersei & Joffrey 1x07.jpg|thumb]]
In King's Landing, Eddard is summoned to the throne room by "King Joffrey"; Robert has died. He arrives to find Littlefinger and Varys waiting for him, along with Commander [[Janos Slynt]] and a detachment of the City Watch. Varys tells him that Renly has fled the city, along with Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] and a number of retainers. The party enters the throne room, where Joffrey sits on the [[Iron Throne]]. He demands oaths of fealty from his councilors and subjects. Instead, Eddard gives Ser Barristan Selmy the proclamation naming him as Lord Protector of the Realm. To Barristan's shock, Cersei takes the "paper shield" and tears it up. Instead, she suggests that Eddard bend the knee and swear allegiance.
[[File:Eddard and Petyr 1x07.png|thumb|Littlefinger betrays Eddard Stark.]]In return he will be allowed to return to Winterfell. Eddard responds that Joffrey has no claim to the Iron Throne and commands Slynt to take the Queen and her son into custody. Instead, the City Watch kill Eddard's bodyguards and Littlefinger holds a knife to his throat, saying, "I did warn you not to trust me."

I swear before the Mother of mountains as the Stars look down in witness. As the stars look down in witness. As the stars look down in witness."

==Behind the scenes==
* The series and episode take their names from Cersei's phrase "When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die".
* This is the only episode in which the phrase "game of thrones" is spoken on-screen.
** In the novels, the phrase is mentioned not only by Cersei in the parallel book scene, but by other characters as well, among them: Varys, Jorah Mormont, Littlefinger, [[Stevron Frey]], a Liddle, [[Ray#In the books|septon Meribald]], Tyrion, Doran Martell and Barristan Selmy.
* Some [[HBO]] subscribers were able to watch the episode a week early on the HBO Go digital platform.
* The revelation that Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen are not Robert's children means that Robert's younger brother, [[Stannis Baratheon]], is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. Stannis appears in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]].
** Renly correctly points out that the line of succession is not the only that counts for becoming a king; Robert was not the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]'s rightful heir (Rhaegar was), yet he became a king because he seized the Iron Throne by force. 
*** According to the novels, Robert's grandmother was Targaryen (princess Rhaelle, [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon V]]'s youngest daughter); this fact meant only that he had a better claim than the other [[Eddard Stark|two]] [[Jon Arryn|leaders]] of the [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]], had there been a dispute over the question who should have been the new king. It did not make Robert Aerys's rightful heir.
* Ned mentions that Stannis led men into war twice, presumably referring to the [[Siege of Storm's End]] and a [[sea battle off Fair Isle]].
* Renly asks Ned "Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings?". In view of Robert's very poor conduct as a king, the answer is clearly "not necessarily". Robert has been a great military commander, but, as Ned has witnessed firsthand, he has been a very incompetent king: he used to spend most of his time whoring, drinking, feasting and seeking other entertainments, rather than taking care of the realm affairs; he recklessly spent the royal treasure, to the point that the Crown owes about six million Gold Dragons to various creditors; he allowed corrupt people like Littlefinger and [[Janos Slynt]] to serve at key positions in his administration.
** In the book, on his deathbed, Robert himself admits "What a wrecthed king I've been. Bad as Aerys". Obviously, Robert was not as bad as the bloodthirsty psychopath tyrant Aerys was, not even remotely, but ruled the realm very poorly.
* The establishing shots of the Lannister camp, at 3:28, show [[Timett]] and [[Chella]] in error. The footage was taken from scenes shot for the next episode, "[[The Pointy End]]".
* The stag shown being skinned by Charles Dance (as Tywin Lannister) was real. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (as Jaime Lannister) enjoys venison, and he hoped that, after the scene, the stag could be sent to Craft Services, but that didn't happen. The books never portray Tywin skinning a stag. The books do introduce another character this way - Lord [[Randyll Tarly]], Sam's father, who is doing this in ''A Game of Thrones'' during a flashback in which Sam tells Jon Snow about how his father made him join the Night's Watch (chapter 26, Jon IV). Randyll Tarly had yet to be cast when this scene was filmed, so the show's writers gave this introduction to Tywin.
** Since a stag is the sigil of House Baratheon, Tywin's act is perhaps a foreshadowing of Robert's death, caused by two Lannisters - Cersei and Lancel.
* To date, this is one of only six episodes in which [[Tyrion Lannister]] has not appeared. The other five are "[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]", "[[First of His Name]]", "[[The Watchers on the Wall]]", "[[Blood of My Blood]]", and "[[The Broken Man]]".
* In the book, Eddard sends Stannis a letter telling him that he is the rightful heir, but the letter is intercepted. Stannis already suspected that Cersei's children were not Robert's, as he was investigating it with Jon Arryn. Since Arryn's death, Stannis has been building his forces on Dragonstone.
* Littlefinger would never support Stannis's claim to the throne: Stannis has despised Littlefinger ever since the latter protected City Watch Commander [[Janos Slynt]] from prosecution and dismissal, after the discovery that Slynt was receiving bribes. Moreover, Stannis is a strict adherent to law and order, and he has banned prostitution on Dragonstone, so Baelish's livelihood would end if Stannis came to power. Ned should have realized that; typically for him, he has not.
* Renly claims that Stannis "inspires no love or loyalty". Indeed, one of Stannis's main flaws is the lack of popularity and charisma. Stannis himself admits that in the novels: "[[Robert Baratheon|My brother]] made them [his foes] love him, but it would seem that I inspire only betrayal."{{Bookref|ASOS|36}}
*The scene between Tywin and Jaime, and the scene between Theon, Osha, and Maester Luwin, were written at the last minute because the rough cut of the episode was running short. Both scenes were filmed in post-production reshoots, and they contain only interior shots which didn't need to be filmed on location.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.</ref>
*Jorah accurately states that Aegon conquered "six of the kingdoms". The seventh, [[Dorne]], successfully resisted the invasion during the [[First Dornish War]]; a century and a half later, [[Daeron I Targaryen|one of the Targaryen kings]] managed to [[Conquest of Dorne|conquer Dorne]], but only temporarily. Dorne eventually accepted the Iron Throne's rule, peacefully and voluntarily, two centuries after the first Targaryen invasion, through marriage.
*In "[[The Wolf and the Lion]]", Ned firmly objected to assassinate Daenerys. In view of this episode, it ''seems'' that he was right: the attempt on Daenerys's life has made Drogo change his mind about crossing the sea to Westeros. As things [[Battle of King's Landing|turned to be]], however, Ned was wrong as a matter of principle; Daenerys's death would have saved countless innocent lives, as Pycelle and Varys claimed.
*It was cunning of Cersei to get Robert drunk during the hunt, but how could she be certain that Robert would encounter a boar and get killed or fatally injured? While it is typical for Cersei to plot extremely half-baked schemes (she does that very often in "''A Feast for Crows''"), even the lamest of her schemes never rely on blind luck; she had no reason to act so negligently when her children's lives were at stake.
**In the book, Varys heavily implies that Cersei has positioned henchmen at the wood, assigned to perform an "unfortunate accident" (like shooting a stray arrow) which might happen during a hunt, to make certain Robert would not survive. There is no mentioning of that in the show.

==In the books==
{{Main|Differences in adaptation/Game of Thrones: Season 1#"You Win or You Die"}}
* The episode is adapted from the following chapters of ''A Game of Thrones'':
** Chapter 26, Jon IV: [[Randyll Tarly|A father]] skins a deer while speaking to [[Samwell Tarly|his son]] about the importance of family name and legacy, and the disappointment he feels toward his son.
** Chapter 45, Eddard XII.
** Chapter 47, Eddard XIII.
** Chapter 48, Jon VI.
** Chapter 49, Eddard XIV.
** Chapter 54, Daenerys VI.
** Chapter 56, Tyrion VII.
