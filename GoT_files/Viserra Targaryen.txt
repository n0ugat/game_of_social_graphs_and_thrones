==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Viserra was born in 71 AC. She was said to be the most beautiful of Jaehaerys and Alysanne's daughters. She was vain, high-spirited, and sly.

In 86 AC she was betrothed to Theomore Manderly, the Lord of White Harbor. To break the betrothal, and to potentially become queen, she attempted to seduce her older brother [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]], who promptly sent her away.

In 87 AC, shortly before she was to leave for White Harbor, she escaped for "one last night of laughter" with a group of [[Lordship|lordlings]] and [[Knighthood|knights]]. They competed in a drunken horse race back to the [[Red Keep]], and Viserra collided with the horse of one of her friends, throwing her from her saddle into a wall and breaking her neck.
