{{Quote|When many speak of Harrenhal, their voices drop to whispers. About Mad Lady Lothston, who was said to send a giant bat to send children for her crock pots, and to bathe in blood and serve feasts of human flesh.|[[Catelyn Stark]]|Harrenhal (short)}}
'''Danelle Lothston'''{{Con|D&EN}} was a [[Lord of Harrenhal|Lady of Harrenhal]] and the head of [[House Lothston]]. She's also known as '''Mad Lady Lothston''' and is the stuff of tales and horror stories.

==Biography==
According to tales, Mad Lady Lothston cooked children, which she captured by sending a giant bat - the sigil of House Lothston - out of the castle of [[Harrenhal]], bathed in blood, and served [[cannibalism|feasts of human flesh]].{{Ref|H&L214}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Mad Danelle's backstory is the same. She ruled Harrenhal during the reign of Aerys I and was a loyal vassal of the [[Iron Throne]]. She had long red hair and wore tight-fitting black armor. She was one of the riverlords who came in support of Lord [[Brynden Rivers]] when he marched on Whitewalls to arrest [[Daemon Blackfyre (son of Daemon)|Daemon II Blackfyre]].

The Lothstons held Harrenhal during the time of the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]], with Mad Lady Lothston herself appearing in the third story in the series, ''The Mystery Knight''. Thus she might appear in the potential third season of ''[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.

The legends about Mad Lady Lothston bathing in the blood of slain children are loosely similar to the real-life seventeenth century Hungarian noblewoman [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_B%C3%A1thory Elizabeth Báthory].
