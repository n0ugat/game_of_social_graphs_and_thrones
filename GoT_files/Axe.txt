The '''Axe'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a region on the continent of [[Essos]], located to the east of [[Westeros]]. It is a large, axehead-shaped peninsular extending northwards into the [[Shivering Sea]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Axe is a mountainous headland, an extension of the hills and mountains to the south. [[Norvos]] maintains mines in this area. Ores are taken by land down to the Darkwash River and thence to Norvos and [[Qohor]].

According to legend, the [[Andals]] inhabited the Axe before they migrated further west to [[Andalos]]. However, the Axe has changed hands and been recolonized so many times in its history that this is impossible to verify.
