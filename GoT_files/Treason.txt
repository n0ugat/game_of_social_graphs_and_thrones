'''Treason'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is a serious crime against a sovereign or the realm or kingdom as a whole, including [[rebellion]], [[regicide]], [[oathbreaking]], and espionage. A queen consort committing infidelity against the king is also considered treason.

The punishment for treason is death, usually by public execution. If expedient, a traitor may instead be pardoned in exchange of [[hostage]]s or by agreeing to take the black and join the [[Night's Watch]].

Like [[oathbreaking]], the nature of treason is not an absolute one and is subject to political machinations. It can often depend on whether said treason is successful. While a defeated rebel will be condemned and executed as a traitor, a victorious one will be in power and will merely receive the epithet [[usurper]].

In the city of [[King's Landing]], those accused of treason are confined to the [[Black Cells]].

==Major cases and accusations of treason==
*[[Brandon Stark]], eldest son and heir of Lord [[Rickard Stark]], was arrested for treason by King [[Aerys II Targaryen]] after protesting the [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|kidnapping]] of his sister [[Lyanna Stark|Lyanna]] by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]. When Lord Rickard arrived at the capital to ransom his son, King Aerys arrested him for treason as well. He later has both Starks [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|brutally executed]].
*The lords [[Robert Baratheon]], [[Eddard Stark]], [[Jon Arryn]], [[Hoster Tully]] and later [[Tywin Lannister]], as well as their bannermen, households, and followers, committed treason against King Aerys when they [[Robert's Rebellion|rebelled]] against him. However, as they were victorious in their rebellion, they have never been judged as such. Robert Baratheon, however, has become known as "The [[Usurper]]" by those who secretly remain loyal to [[House Targaryen]].
*Grand Maester [[Pycelle]] betrayed Aerys II when he counseled the Mad King to open the gates of [[King's Landing]] to Tywin Lannister when the latter presented himself before the city gates offering protection against the rebellion. Pycelle was aware Tywin did not intend to defend the city.
*Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] violated his [[Kingsguard]] oath and murdered his king, Aerys II, during the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. He was subsequently pardoned by King Robert.
*[[Eddard Stark]], acting in his authority as [[Hand of the King]], decided to move against Prince [[Joffrey Baratheon]] and prevent his coronation by taking him prisoner, having discovered that Joffrey has no right to the throne. [[Petyr Baelish]] reminded him that such action will be considered treason only if they lose. Baelish and [[Janos Slynt]] [[Massacre in the Red Keep|betray Eddard]], who was arrested and executed for treason against Joffrey, accused of seeking to install himself on the [[Iron Throne]].
*The rebellion of the [[North]] and the [[Riverlands]] to secede from the authority of the [[Iron Throne]] is regarded as treason by those who remain loyal to King Joffrey.
*[[Renly Baratheon]] committed treason when he tried to take the [[Iron Throne]] despite being fourth in the line of succession, ignoring the (false) rights of his nephew [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], Robert's official heir, and the true rights of his older brother [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]].
*[[Theon Greyjoy]] betrayed [[Robb Stark]] and joined his father, [[Balon Greyjoy]], in his conquest of the North.
*[[Rast]], a brother of the [[Night's Watch]], killed [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] in the [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep]].
*Lord [[Rickard Karstark]], furious over the death of his son [[Torrhen Karstark|Torrhen]] by Jaime Lannister, accused [[Catelyn Stark]] of treason after she released Jaime. Lord Rickard himself was later executed for treason against [[King in the North]] [[Robb Stark]] for murdering [[hostage]]s [[Willem Lannister|Willem]] and [[Martyn Lannister]].
*Lords [[Walder Frey]] and [[Roose Bolton]] committed treason by conspiring with [[Tywin Lannister]] to [[Red Wedding|eliminate]] Robb Stark and his family.
*[[Alliser Thorne]] committed treason by organizing the [[Mutiny at Castle Black]] that claims Lord Commander [[Jon Snow]]'s life. 
*Lord [[Smalljon Umber]] committed treason by handing [[Rickon Stark]] over to [[Ramsay Bolton]].
*[[Petyr Baelish]] was put on [[Trial of Petyr Baelish|trial]] by [[House Stark]] for conspiring with [[House Lannister]] against the Starks, among other accuastions.
*[[Samwell Tarly]] told [[Jon Snow]] that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] shouldn't be queen, and that Jon was the rightful king. Jon spurned the notion as treason.
*Tyrion Lannister was once again accused of treason by Daenerys for freeing his brother against her wishes.
