'''Grey Ghost'''{{Con|F&B}} is a wild [[dragon]] residing on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Grey Ghost was a pale grey-white dragon, residing in a smoking vent high on the eastern side of the [[Dragonmont]]. He earned his name for his solitary nature, shyly avoiding men and their works, remaining unseen for years at a time. He could sometimes be glimpsed hunting for fish in the [[Narrow Sea]].

Similarly to the [[Cannibal]], Grey Ghost never accepted a rider.
