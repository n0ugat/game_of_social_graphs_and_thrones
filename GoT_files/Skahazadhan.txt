In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Skahazadhan is a slow river with brown water. Its source is in the hills and mountains west of the [[Jade Sea]]. The river flows south-west, dividing the [[Dothraki Sea]] from the [[Red Waste]], with Lhazar located in an arm of the river. The river flows through the Khazai Pass before entering Meereen's hinterland and finally the sea.
