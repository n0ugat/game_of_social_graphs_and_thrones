==Biography==
===Background===
Serena Blackfyre was a peasant girl who married [[Daemon Blackfyre]], legitimized [[bastard]] son of [[King]] [[Aegon IV Targaryen]] and his cousin, [[Daena Targaryen]]. She was the mother of the twins [[Aegon Blackfyre|Aegon]] and [[Aemon Blackfyre]], as well as [[Daemon Blackfyre (son of Daemon)|Daemon II Blackfyre]]{{Ref|GOT104}} and [[Haegon Blackfyre]]. Her marriage to Daemon was arranged by Daemon's half-brother, King [[Daeron II Targaryen]].{{Ref|h&l803}}

Serena, along with her offspring, is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]] entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. Her entry specifies that she was a peasant. Serena and Daemon must have married prior to 183 AC, when the couple's eldest sons (twins Aegon and Aemon) were born.{{Ref|GOT104}}

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of a Serena Blackfyre, and there was no name given to Daemon Blackfyre's wife when Season 1 premiered. However, ''The World of Ice & Fire'' reveals that Daemon was married to Rohanne of Tyrosh, a match that was arranged by his father, Aegon IV and finalized by his half-brother, Daeron II.
