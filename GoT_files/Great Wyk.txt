'''Great Wyk'''{{Ref|H&L203}} is one of the [[Iron Islands]], an archipelago located on [[Ironman's Bay]], on the western side of [[Westeros]]. It is the largest of the seven main Iron Islands.

It is also the home of [[House Merlyn|Houses Merlyn]], [[House Sparr|Sparr]], and [[House Goodbrother|Goodbrother]].<ref>Season 2 bluray: War of the Five Kings feature</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Great Wyk is the largest of the seven main islands that make up the Iron Islands, and thus the only one on which certain noble houses derive more of their wealth from the land than the sea (such as House Goodbrother, which gains its wealth from iron mines in the island's central hills). It is still the second wealthiest of the islands overall, behind [[Harlaw]] (which is the second largest of the islands).
