The '''Stony Shore'''{{Ref|GOT203}} is a region in the [[North]]. It forms part of the west coast, west of the [[Rills]] and southwest of the [[Wolfswood]] and [[Sea Dragon Point]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
As part of [[Ironborn invasion of the North|his campaign to seize the North]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]], [[Balon Greyjoy]] orders [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] to raid the fishing villages of the Stony Shore.<ref>"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Stony Shore is the same.

In the second novel, it is luridly described how the ironborn, led by Theon, have pillaged it: the bodies have been looted and mutilated. Of the fishing village, nothing has remained but cold ashes that stank when it rained. The men have been put to the sword, all but a handful that Theon had allowed to flee to bring the word to [[Torrhen's Square]]. Their wives and daughters have been claimed for [[Salt wife|salt wives]], those who were young enough and fair. The crones and the ugly ones have simply been raped and killed, or taken for [[thrall]]s if they had useful skills and did not seem likely to cause trouble.

As news about the harrying of the Stony Shore reach Torrhen's Square, Leobald Tallhart sends there a force to deal with the ironborn, under the command of his nephew Benfred, but the force is ambushed and destroyed by the ironborn.

In the third novel, [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] and [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] mention that most of the Stony Shore is still held by ironborn.

In the fifth novel, many villagers of the Stony Shore, who have fled the ironborn, join Stannis after he [[Fight by Deepwood Motte|liberates Deepwood Motte]].
