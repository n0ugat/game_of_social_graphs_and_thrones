'''Jerome Patrick Flynn''' (born 16 March 1963) is an English actor. He is best known for his role as Paddy Garvey in five seasons of the popular drama series ''[[wikipedia:Soldier, Soldier|Soldier, Soldier]]''. While filming this series he and co-star [[wikipedia:Robson Green|Robson Green]] filmed a scene where they had to sing the song ''[[wikipedia:Unchained Melody|Unchained Melody]]''. Impressed, record producer [[wikipedia:Simon Cowell|Simon Cowell]] convinced them to release the song commercially. They went on to enjoy a period of musical success as [[wikipedia:Robson and Jerome|Robson and Jerome]] between 1995 and 1999. Following this Flynn went to play in musicals and on stage.

Since 2012 he has played the regular role of police Sgt. Bennet Drake on the BBC drama series ''[[Wikipedia:Ripper Street|Ripper Street]]''. Actors with recurring roles in the series included [[Michael McElhatton]] and [[Ian McElhinney]].

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' Flynn plays the role of [[Bronn]]. He was confirmed in the role on 16 July 2010. He initially appeared as a guest star in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|first season]] and joined the starring cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]].

Flynn auditioned for the part while he had a black eye, left over from when he knocked himself in his brother's kitchen the day before. He insists that this gave him a rough look which got him the part. Flynn auditioned for Bronn while affecting a Scottish accent, but the producers decided that he should speak with a jaunty Northern English accent.<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2013/10/game-of-thrones-bronn-jerome-flynn-comic-con.html Vulture.com], NYCC 2013 panel</ref>
