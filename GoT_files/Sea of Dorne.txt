The '''Sea of Dorne'''{{Mapref|Viewer's Guide}} is a large inlet of the [[Narrow Sea]] in southern [[Westeros]], separating [[Dorne]] from the [[Stormlands]]. The islands of Estermont and the [[Stepstones]] guard the mouth of the Sea of Dorne.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Sea of Dorne is in the same location, bordered by the coast of Dorne to the south and the coast of Cape Wrath to the north. The coast of Dorne is craggy and difficult to land on, making invading the land by sea extremely difficult (although King Daeron I Targaryen did manage this during both of his attempts to conquer Dorne).

The castles of [[Wyl]], [[Yronwood]], the [[Tor]] and [[Ghost Hill]] lie on the Dornish coast, while [[Stonehelm]] and [[Mistwood]] lie on the Stormland coast. The Dornish maintain a prison on the tiny rock of Ghaston Grey, located just off the coast near the Tor. The prison's location makes it almost impossible to escape from.
