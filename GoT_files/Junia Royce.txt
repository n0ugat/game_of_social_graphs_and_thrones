Junia Royce was the thirdborn child, and firstborn daughter, of Lord [[Maynard Royce]] and Lady [[Mavis Royce]].

==Behind the scenes==
Junia Royce is mentioned in the section on House Royce in the Season 1 prop for ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''. The section on House Royce never appears on-screen in the TV series, as its planned appearance, where [[Eddard Stark]] would have read from it, was cut.

==In the books==
Junia Royce is referenced only in the TV adaptation of ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' and has no corresponding counterpart in the books.
