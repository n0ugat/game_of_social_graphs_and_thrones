The '''Lhazareen''',{{Ref|GOT201}} also known as the '''Lamb Men''',{{Ref|GOT201}} are shepherds from the continent of [[Essos]]. Established on [[Lhazar]], southeast of [[Vaes Dothrak]], their camps are frequently raided for slaves by the [[Dothraki]].

Mirroring the importance of shep
herding in Lhazareen culture, their deity is known as the [[Great Shepherd]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Lhazareen have a physical appearance similar to the Dothraki, with copper skin, dark hair, and almond-shaped eyes, but they are also more squat in stature and flat-faced.

Lhazar was never part of the [[Valyrian Freehold]], so unlike the Free Cities and even nearby [[Slaver's Bay]] which had been conquered by Valyria, the Lhazareen language is not derived from Valyrian. There are no examples of the Lhazareen language in the books beyond person and place names, but it is described as having a singsong quality.

The Dothraki believe the Lhazareen engage in sexual acts with their sheep - though outsiders also think the Dothraki engage in sexual acts with their horses, so this probably isn't credible.

In "''A Dance with Dragons''", Daenerys makes an alliance with Lhazar. Fighters from Lhazar are among those who come to Meereen to battle in the Fighting Pits.

A former Lhazareen slave named the Red Lamb goes into training in the Great Pyramid to become a knight, serves as a squire to Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], and eventually becomes a newly-made knight. He takes part in the [[Second siege of Meereen#In the books|second siege of Meereen]], and kills one of the Yunkish lords known as the Little Pigeon.
