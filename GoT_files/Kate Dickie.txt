==On ''Game of Thrones''==

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', she plays the role of [[Lysa Arryn]]. She was announced in the role on 16 July 2010. She appeared in several episodes of the [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|first season]]. It was reported that she filmed a scene for the [[Mhysa|final episode]] of [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]], but this scene was cut from the final episode. Her agent later confirmed that she would return for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth season]].<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/06/slynt-lysa-and-rorge-set-to-return-for-s4/ Winter is Coming]</ref> She reprised the role for two episodes of the fourth season, before her character's demise.

Kate Dickie later said that after being cast, she quickly read through all of the books until the point when her character died (at the end of the third novel, corresponding to the end of Season 4), to know as much about her as possible. The secret was finally revealed in Season 4 that it was actually ''Lysa'' who poisoned her own husband Jon Arryn, at Littlefinger's suggestion, and that the two of them were the secret architects of the ''entire'' [[War of the Five Kings]] that set the plot of the TV series in motion. Even the secret letter that Lysa sent to Catelyn at Winterfell blaming the Lannisters was a lie, and this also explains why later in Season 1, Lysa bizarrely refused to ally the Vale's armies with the Starks in rebelling against the Lannisters. As Dickie explained, she ''already knew'' all of this in Season 1 from quickly reading through the first three novels, so she indeed fully understood Lysa's secret backstory, and knew to play the scenes in Season 1 as if Lysa was secretly lying to Catelyn.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/the-fall-of-lysa-arryn-an-interview-with-kate-dickie/ ]</ref>

In an interview with ''WatchersOnTheWall.com'' in 2015, after her role had ended, Dickie said:

:"I'm always attracted to characters who are complex and dark so it was thrilling too. I remember calling my agent and saying ‘I love her! I absolutely love her!’ I know most people would say ‘I hate her! I absolutely hate her!’ But for me, I just saw a very damaged, fragile soul who, yes, had made terrible decisions and awful ones too, but was also someone who’d had a traumatic, sad life and was psychologically broken in a lot of ways. And that’s what made me want to look after her."<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/the-fall-of-lysa-arryn-an-interview-with-kate-dickie/ ]</ref>
