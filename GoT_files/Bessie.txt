==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
While reminiscing with [[Eddard Stark]], Robert is trying to recall the name of Ned's mistress, confusing Bessie with [[Wylla]]. Robert remembers her fondly as having big breasts.{{Ref|GOT102}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the conversation is very similar, except that Ned does not correct Robert, since the name of the girl in question is Becca. Robert fondly remembers her sweet big eyes rather than her big breasts.
