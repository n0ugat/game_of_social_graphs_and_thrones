The '''Lord of Casterly Rock''',{{Ref|GOT108}} or simply the '''Lord of the Rock''',{{Ref|GOT407}} is the ruler of the stronghold of [[Casterly Rock]], the administrative center of the [[Westerlands]]. The holder is the ruler of the entire region of the Westerlands.

The Westerlands were originally a sovereign nation known as the [[Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]], until [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] arrived in [[Westeros]] and [[Aegon's Conquest|united]] the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. [[House Lannister]], the richest family in the Seven Kingdoms, have ruled as the Lords of Casterly Rock for thousands of years. According to legend, they have held the title since the [[Age of Heroes]], when [[Lann the Clever]] swindled [[House Casterly]] out of Casterly Rock using nothing but his wits.

[[Tyrion Lannister]] is Lord of Casterly Rock, inheriting the claim from his father [[Tywin Lannister]] and officially inheriting the title from his sister [[Cersei Lannister]]. Typically, the Lord of Casterly Rock also holds the title of [[Warden of the West]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Although Tyrion is by right the heir to Casterly Rock, since his elder brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is a knight of the [[Kingsguard]], Tywin makes it clear that he has no intention of allowing Tyrion to be the Lord of Casterly Rock. It is therefore not clear who the heir to Casterly Rock currently is.<ref>"[[Valar Dohaeris]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
With the [[Assassinations in the Tower of the Hand|murder of Tywin]], Queen Cersei stands as the new Lady of Casterly Rock as Tywin's closest lawful heir, since Tyrion has been declared guilty of [[regicide]] and fled across the [[Narrow Sea]]. Although Jaime made a deal with Tywin to leave the Kingsguard and become his heir again, Tyrion's guilty verdict rendered that deal null, even if Tywin had lived.<ref>"[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]"</ref><ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
With Jaime's dismissal from the Kingsguard,<ref>"[[Blood of My Blood]]"</ref> it was possible that he would inherit his father's titles and positions, thus becoming the new Lord of the Rock ahead of his sister Cersei, but that never happened. 

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Cersei and Jaime are both crushed by rubble under the [[Red Keep]] during the [[Battle of King's Landing]], leaving Tyrion to become the undisputed Lord of Casterly Rock after [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s victory.
