'''Gelmarr''' was an [[Ironborn]] raider and a member of the ''[[Sea Bitch]]'s'' crew.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Gelmarr is present when [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] gives a speech encouraging his crew to resist the [[Northmen]] led by [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]] and to die a glorious death.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
[[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] learn that the Ironborn captured at Winterfell were all [[Flaying|flayed]] alive on Ramsay's orders, despite being promised mercy if they surrendered.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Gelmarr's background is the same. He's also known as "Gelmarr the Grim". Gelmarr takes part in the raid of [[Stony Shore]], the [[capture of Winterfell]] and the hunt for [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark|Rickon]].

Gelmarr, alongside [[Aggar]] and Gynir Rednose, takes part, at Theon's orders, in the abduction and killing of the unnamed [[Jack#In the books|miller's]] [[Billy#In the books|sons]], whose corpses are passed off as Bran's and Rickon's. Gelmarr also kills the kids' mother with one blow of his axe, as she cries to Theon for mercy.

The very night they return from Acorn Water, Gelmarr allegedly tumbles down some steps and breaks his back; Aggar and Gynir are also killed within the next days. Later it is revealed that the three were secretly killed by "Reek" (actually, Ramsay in disguise) at Theon's command, to prevent them from revealing the truth about the slain children; since Theon needs a scapegoat, he falsely accuses [[Farlen]] of the killing and executes him.

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', when some men mysteriously die one by one at Winterfell, Theon is reminded of Aggar, Gelmarr, and Gynir.
