{{Quote|Lowell there... likes 'em a bit broken in.|[[Polliver]] to [[Sandor Clegane]]|Two Swords}}
'''Lowell''' was a [[man-at-arms]] fighting for [[House Lannister]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]] under the command of Ser [[Gregor Clegane]], the Mountain. He directly worked for Clegane's second-in-command, [[Polliver]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
Lowell is at a tavern along with Polliver and three other Lannister soldiers, harassing the innkeeper and attempting to molest his daughter. He sits down at a table, eating some chicken, as [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] and [[Arya Stark|Arya]] walk in.{{Ref|GOT401}}

The Hound argues with Polliver about giving him a free chicken. Polliver offers a trade - a chicken in return for letting the Lannister men take turns molesting Arya. He then gestures to Lowell, saying that he likes the girls he molests to be "broken in" beforehand. This ultimately leads to a [[Brawl in a tavern in the Riverlands|brawl between the Hound and the soldiers]]. Lowell attempts to fight back, but is violently punched in the mouth by the Hound and falls to the floor. After getting back up, Lowell again tries to swing at the Hound, but the Hound instead parries Lowell's sword into the crotch of another soldier. Lowell proceeds to tackle the Hound to the ground and holds a knife to his throat, but the Hound fights back and uses Lowell's own blade to stab him in the eyes multiple times, killing him.{{Ref|GOT401}}

At a meeting of the [[Small Council]], [[Varys]] informs the other members that the Hound has slaughtered five Lannister solders in the [[Riverlands]].{{Ref|GOT406}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Lowell. The people whom Arya and the Hound encounter and fight at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] are [[Polliver]], the [[Tickler]] and a squire of [[House Sarsfield]].
