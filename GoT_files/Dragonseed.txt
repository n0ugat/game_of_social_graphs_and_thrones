==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, "dragonseeds" was a term used to describe [[bastard]]s of [[House Targaryen]] and [[House Velaryon]]. They were often born as a result of the "first night" custom, which was not as resented on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] and [[Driftmark]] as it was in many other parts of [[Westeros]], due to the fact that many of the [[smallfolk]] viewed the Targaryens as gods. Women whom the Lord of Dragonstone impregnated were even seen as "blessed", and the children born of these unions were often given lavish gifts by their fathers. The practice continued even after it was outlawed by King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]].

Due to lack of an official census registration, it was uncertain whether the alleged dragonseeds were in fact offsprings of Targaryens or Velaryons. Their physical appearance did not mean much, since in Dragonstone and in Driftmark were plenty of people of Valyrian origin, who had the Targaryen physical features. [[Nettles]], for example, had a black hair, brown eyes, and a brown skin - not even remotely resembling a Targaryen; yet she managed to tame [[Sheepstealer]], and for that she was considered as a dragonseed.
