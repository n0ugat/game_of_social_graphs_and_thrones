{{Quote|A king should honor the traditions of his forebears.|Jacaerys Velaryon|The Lord of the Tides}}
Prince '''Jacaerys Velaryon''',{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Jakaerys Velarion''}} nicknamed '''Jace''', is a [[prince]] of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]], and the firstborn son of Queen [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. He is the [[Dragonrider|rider]] of the [[dragon]] [[Vermax]].{{Guideref|Vermax}}

==Biography==
===Background===
Jacaerys is the eldest son of Rhaenyra Targaryen and her husband Laenor Velaryon, and older brother of [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] and [[Joffrey Velaryon]]. He is second-in-line to inherit the [[Iron Throne]] after his mother, Rhaenyra.{{Guideref|Character Guide}} Per an agreement between [[Viserys I Targaryen]] and [[Corlys Velaryon]], Jacaerys is expected to take the name "Jacaerys Targaryen" upon acceding to the throne.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Although presented as legitimate, Jacaerys and his brothers are in truth [[bastard]]s fathered by Ser [[Harwin Strong]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Jace and Luke are playing with Harwin when Rhaenyra and Laenor return to their chambers in the [[Red Keep]] with the newborn Joffrey. There, Jace and Luke show the [[dragon]] egg that they chose for Joffrey, and Jace says that he let Luke choose. Laenor takes Jace and Luke back to the [[Dragonpit]], where Jace is trained by [[Dragonkeepers]] to command [[Vermax]]. While there, Jace, Luke, and [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] pull a joke on [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] by giving him a pig dressed as a dragon and making squealing noises.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Jace later trains in arms alongside Luke, Aegon, and Aemond under Ser [[Criston Cole]]. When Harwin advises Criston to train the boys equally, Criston grabs Jace and has him fight Aegon, who Criston has knock Jace to the ground. Harwin steps in to defend Jace, and Harwin is provoked by Criston into attacking him. As a result, Harwin is dismissed from court and sent back to [[Harrenhal]]. Harwin promises Jace that he will return. Jace runs to watch Harwin as he leaves, and Rhaenyra assures him that they will exchange letters. He then asks his mother if Harwin is his father, and if he is a bastard, but Rhaenyra tells him that he is a Targaryen, and that is all that matters.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

At the conclusion of a [[Small Council]] meeting, Rhaenyra proposes to betrothed Jacaerys with Alicent's daughter, [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] in an effort to mend the rift between herself and Alicent and unite their families, to which Alicent ultimately declines. Jacaerys later departs with his mother, father, and younger brothers to Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

Jace is present with Rhaenyra, Laenor, Lucerys, and the rest of the royal family during the funeral of his aunt, [[Laena Velaryon]]. During the funeral reception after, Rhaenyra implores Jace to comfort his grieving cousins. Jace replies that he can sympathize with their grief, informing his mother that they should be at [[Harrenhal]] mourning the loss of Lord Lyonel and his true father, Ser Harwin. Rhaenyra chastises Jace that visiting Harrenhal would not be appropriate, reminding Jace that the [[House Velaryon|Velaryons]] are their true family, while the [[House Strong|Strongs]] are not. Jace proceeds to walk over to [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]], with Baela holding his hand for comfort.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Later that evening, Jace is awoken by Baela and Rhaena, who informs him that someone has stolen [[Vhagar]], their late mother's dragon. The trio, alongside Lucerys, proceed to confront a returning [[Aemond Targaryen]], with Rhaena correctly deducing that he was the one who had taken Vhagar and stating that Vhagar was hers to claim. Aemond retorts that Vhagar is now his, before insulting Rhaena by stating that her cousins can find a pig for her to ride, causing Rhaena to angrily grapple with him. When Aemond pushes her to the ground, Baela punches him in the face, only for Aemond to do the same, threatening to feed Baela to Vhagar if she attacks him again. This prompts Jace to enter the fray, followed by Luke, but both are knocked to the ground. Despite this, Jace manages to push Aemond to the ground, and he, Baela, and Rhaena begin to pummel Aemond. Aemond manages to escape before grabbing Luke by the throat and brandishing a rock to hit him with, threatening to burn Luke alive just like his father, before calling Luke and Jace bastards. This prompts Jace to unsheathe a knife and attack him, but Aemond dodges him before hitting him in the head with the rock. As Aemond prepares to strike Jace again, Jace blinds him with sand before Luke grabs the dropped knife and slashes Aemond in the left eye. The commotion attracts the attention of Lord Commander [[Harrold Westerling]] and other members of the [[Kingsguard]], including [[Criston Cole|Ser Criston]], ordering the children to cease fighting.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

The children are brought to the Hall of Nine, where King Viserys angrily demands to know from his Kingsguard how this happened, while Aemond's eye is tended to by Maester [[Kelvyn]] as Corlys, [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]], Rhaenyra, and [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] enter the hall. As the children begin arguing on who was responsible for the fight, Viserys orders them into silence, before demanding the truth from Aemond. Queen [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] comments on what more can be said since Aemond was maimed by Luke. Rhaenyra states in the defense of her children that it was a regrettable accident, that her sons were only defending themselves, and that vile accusations of their parentage were uttered. When Viserys asks what insults were said, Jace states that Aemond called him and Luke bastards. Rhaenyra tells her father that since Jace is in line to inherit the throne, such rumors on Jace's legitimacy are the highest of treasons. Viserys demands for Aemond to tell him the truth on where he heard of these rumors, with Aemond replying Aegon told him. When Viserys questions Aegon on where he heard the rumors, Aegon simply states that everyone knows based on Jace and Luke's unusual Targaryen appearance.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Viserys furiously demands that the children make peace with another as they are family, before declaring that anyone who question's the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's children will have their tongue's removed. Alicent states that this is insufficent, insisting that one of Rhaenyra's children should lose an eye in exchange for the one Aemond lost. Viserys flatly denies this course of action, but Alicent continues to press the issue, using her authority as queen to order Ser Criston to bring her one of Luke's eye, shocking the assembled court. Viserys again demands for Alicent to stop, but as he walks away, Alicent takes his [[Valyrian steel dagger]] and attempts to carry out the punishment herself, sending the hall into an uproar. Rhaenyra steps forward to protect Jace and Luke from Alicent, getting slashed in her left arm in the process.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

The following day, Jace is present with Luke and Rhaenyra as Maester Kelvyn sews her arm wound. He is subsequently dismissed by his mother alongside his brother Luke, when their father, Laenor, enters the room asking what happened.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Following the incident with Aemond and the alleged murder and funeral of Laenor, Jace is present alongside Luke and their cousins, Baela and Rhaena, for the marriage of his mother and their father, Rhaenyra and Daemon, at Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Six years pass, during which time Jace grows into a diligent and studious young man. He studies history and High Valyrian under the tutelage of Maester [[Gerardys]], berating himself for making mistakes in his lessons, despite his mother's reassurances he has time to learn.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Jace accompanies his mother, younger brothers, stepfather and cousin/stepsister Rhaena to King's Landing as Rhaenyra and Daemon attempt to challenge [[Vaemond Velaryon]]'s effort to claim rule of Driftmark from Lucerys. While Rhaenyra and Daemon meet with Alicent and Viserys, Jace and Luke head to the Red Keep's yard. Jace fondly reminisces about their boyhood days training there, while Luke is more self-conscious of the stares of the courtiers, aware that his resemblance to Harwin Strong rather than Laenor Velaryon undermines his claim to Driftmark. The brothers notice a crowd forming around a sparring match; to their shock, they see [[Criston Cole]] duelling their uncle, Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]], who has grown into a formidable warrior since they last met. Aemond spots his nephews in the crowd as he finishes his bout and asks Jace and Luke if they've come to train with a menacing edge to his voice. Jace and Luke are spared having to answer by the arrival of Vaemond.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

The next day, Jace attends a court session in the throne room to decide on the inheritance of Driftmark. He is a witness to his grandfather's arrival to preside over the matter. During the session, his grandmother Rhaenys backs Luke's claim to Driftmark, and announces she has accepted a proposal put to her by Rhaenyra to betroth Jace and Luke to Baela and Rhaena respectively, much to the surprise but happiness of both couples. Jace is offended when a defeated Vaemond angrily slanders him and his brothers as [[bastards]] and denounces Rhaenyra as a whore, but is taken by surprise when Daemon executes Vaemond for the insults with [[Dark Sister]].{{Ref|HOTD108}}

That evening, Jace is a guest at a feast held in Viserys's quarters to try and appease tensions amongst the royal family. Despite being angered by his uncle Aegon's uncouth comments towards his betrothed, in the spirit of reconciliation, Jace offers a toast to Aegon and Aemond in recognition of their shared child, and offers his aunt [[Helaena Targaryen]] a dance, much to her delight. Unfortunately, the reconciliatory mood is shattered when Lucerys, amused at the memory of "the Pink Dread," can't help but snigger when a suckling pig is set on the table before Aemond. Infuriated by the reminder of his childhood humiliation, Aemond gets to his feet and sarcastically toasts Jace and Luke, calling them "wise, handsome, and strong." Aware Aemond is indirectly insulting them, Jace and Luke promptly get into a fight with Aemond and Aegon before Daemon separates them. Rhaenyra sends her sons and stepdaughters to their chambers, and the family returns to Dragonstone later that night.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

Unbeknownst to Rhaenyra's family, some time after, Viserys dies in his sleep and the [[Greens]] stage a [[Coup in King's Landing|coup]] to place Jace's uncle Aegon on the [[Iron Throne]] as King Aegon II Targaryen. Jace's grandmother Rhaenys escapes captivity in King's Landing with the help of Ser [[Erryk Cargyll]] and her dragon [[Meleys]] to bring word to Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD109}} 

Unaware of these events, Jace spars with Luke on Dragonstone's beach under the tutelage of Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]] of the Kingsguard; when Jace angrily berates Luke for his poor form in the bout, Steffon gently suggests Jace might go easier on his younger brother so Luke can learn what Jace is trying to teach. Their training is interrupted by Rhaenys, who brings them to their mother's bedchamber (Rhaenyra having been sent into premature labor by the news of her father's death and Aegon's usurping the throne); Rhaenyra tells them what has happened and commands Jace to ensure Daemon does nothing without her say-so. Jace interjects into a meeting Daemon is hosting with the lords of the Narrow Sea, the Kingsguard and the captains of Dragonstone's garrison and relays his mother's command. Daemon tries to override Jace, telling him he must patrol the skies on Vermax, but Jace holds firm and reiterates Rhaenyra's command. Daemon then takes Jace, along with Sers Steffon Darklyn and [[Lorent Marbrand]] to the [[Dragonmont]], where Jace witnesses Daemon compel Lorent and Steffon swear oaths of fealty to Rhaenyra as Queen and him as her heir, under threat of having [[Caraxes]] burn them alive.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

Rhaenyra ultimately gives birth to a stillborn daughter, Jace's half-sister [[Visenya Targaryen (daughter of Rhaenyra)|Visenya]]. Jace is in attendance at Visenya's funeral, and witnesses his mother's impromptu coronation as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms following the arrival of Erryk Cargyll with his grandfather's crown, being among the first to kneel to Rhaenyra. He also attends the subsequent first meeting of the [[Black Council]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

During negotiations between Rhaenyra and Otto Hightower on the bridge to Dragonstone, among the terms offered is that Rhaenyra will be confirmed as Lady of Dragonstone, with the title, castle and holdings passing to Jacaerys upon her death.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

At a second meeting of the Black Council the next day, Jace speaks up when Rhaenyra insists the Blacks must secure the loyalties of Houses [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|Stark]], [[House Arryn/House of the Dragon|Arryn]] and [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|Baratheon]] for the coming conflict, volunteering himself and Lucerys as envoys, as the lords of the Great Houses will find it more difficult to refuse [[dragonrider]]s than ravens. When Lord Corlys speaks in support of Jace's proposal, Rhaenyra agrees to send Jace to first the [[Eyrie]] and [[Winterfell]] to treat with Lady [[Jeyne Arryn]] and Lord [[Cregan Stark]], while Luke goes to [[Storm's End]] to treat with Lord [[Borros Baratheon]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

That evening, on the bridge to Dragonstone, Rhaenyra speaks with Jace and Luke before they depart; Rhaenyra notes that the people of Westeros consider the Targaryens closer to gods than men, but if they aspire to rule Westeros, House Targaryen must answer to [[Seven|the gods of its people]]. To that end, she has Jace and Luke swear on a copy of ''[[The Seven-Pointed Star]]'' that they will be only messengers, not warriors, and take part in no fighting. Rhaenyra tells Jace that Cregan Stark is closer to his age than hers, hoping that they can find some common ground as young men, while assuring Lucerys that the eternally proud Borros Baratheon will be honored to host a prince of the realm. With that, three dragons depart Dragonstone: Jace atop Vermax, bound for the Eyrie and Winterfell, Rhaenys on Meleys to the Gullet, and Luke on Arrax headed for Storm's End.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Jace's diplomatic embassy to the [[Vale of Arryn]] meets with success: Lady Jeyne Arryn agrees to pledge her support to Rhaenyra in return for a [[dragon]] to defend the Vale against any retaliatory counterattack the Greens might send.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Jace then continues onto Winterfell, where Cregan Stark treats him as an honored guest. Jace accompanies Cregan and a party of new recruits for the [[Night's Watch]] chosen by lottery to the [[Wall]]. The pair ascend to the top of the Wall, discussing the pact forged by their ancestors [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and [[Torrhen Stark]], Jace noting Torrhen would only have forfeited the title of [[King in the North]] and bent the knee to Aegon if he believed the unity Aegon would offer could benefit the North. Jace adds that unity is now threatened, warning the realm will tear itself apart unless men honor their vows to support King Viserys's chosen heir. Cregan asserts his intention to honor his oath, but insists he needs to keep men to protect the north. Jace scoffs at the idea of Cregan wasting his men to guard "against [[wildlings]] and weather" while the Hightowers plot to usurp the Iron Throne, insisting the north's support and strength will be invaluable to his mother's efforts to press her claim.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Cregan takes Jace to the same place along the Wall that King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] and his sister-wife [[Alysanne Targaryen]] went to see. As the two youths contemplate the view beyond the Wall, Cregan tells Jace that both Jaehaerys and Alysanne's respective dragons ([[Vermithor]] and [[Silverwing]]) refused to go beyond the Wall, and asks if Jace really believes Cregan's ancestors "built a seven hundred foot wall to keep out snow and savages." When Jace asks what the Wall was meant to keep out, Cregan bluntly replies "[[White Walkers|Death]]." Cregan then agrees to muster an army of "greybeards" immediately, insisting that their age will not be a detriment to their fighting ability when Jace expresses his skepticism. At that moment, a member of the Night's Watch approaches to give him a message brought by a raven from Dragonstone. Cregan reads the message, and then looks to Jace with grim sympathy, as the message bears word of his younger brother, Prince Lucerys's murder at the hands of Aemond Targaryen.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Jace returns to Dragonstone to inform his mother of his success. He reports to Rhaenyra in her quarters, relaying Lady Arryn's request and Lord Stark's promise of men, but his voice breaks out of grief for Lucerys, and Rhaenyra rises from her seat and embraces him.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Jace attends a memorial service the family holds for Lucerys, throwing one of Luke's cloaks onto a pyre, before picking up his little brother [[Joffrey Velaryon|Joffrey]] so he can throw his own tribute (a toy wooden horse) into the flames. Jace then hugs Joffrey close to him, tears in his eyes.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Jace is present at a Black Council meeting where he, his mother and other members receive the news of Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]]'s murder and the Greens' accusation of Rhaenyra having a hand in it. He suggests flying on [[Vermax]] to scout [[King's Landing]]'s movements but is denied by Rhaenyra. It is soon evident that Daemon ordered the queen's vengeance for Lucerys.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Later, Jace finds [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] practicing bank shooting on a cliff, and expresses that she missed supper earlier, although she exclaims that she was not hungry. When Baela inquires on her father's destination, Jace replies that he likely took flight to [[Harrenhal]]. Baela comments that sometimes she thinks she hates her father, and Jace comments that fathers are complicated. He is asked about his adoptive father [[Laenor Velaryon]]; he remarks that he taught him and Luke how to catch fish, sing sailor's shanties and jokes about his infirmity for cake. Baela then asks about his biological father Ser [[Harwin Strong]], who he considered gentle and fierce, being nicknamed "Breakbones." He conveys that he loved him and his brothers, with doubt, but Baela assures him of his father's love. Jace then remarks that he misses his younger brother Luke. Baela puts a hand on his shoulder to comfort him.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Jace sees the buried site of [[Erryk Cargyll]] and [[Arryk Cargyll]], chastising the latter as the "basest of villains" and says that he brings disdain to Erryk's body. Rhaenyra claims that she cannot judge Arryk for keeping his oath, but Jace exclaims that those who sent him are to be judged. He proceeds to leave.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Jace is present in a meeting of the Black Council. Rhaenyra and the members discuss strategics and politics, and the outcome of the [[Battle at the Burning Mill]]. Jace wishes to participate in the war but stays silent.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Jace, Rhaenyra and Baela later walk outside the Dragonstone's halls to bid Joffrey, [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Aegon]], [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|Viserys]] and Rhaena farewell. He examines the dragon eggs and the young dragons [[Stormcloud]] and [[Tyraxes]]. Jace warmly embraces Joffrey before leaving to the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], staying outside to see them depart.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Later at night, Jace is at another Black Council meeting where Baela informs the members of [[Criston Cole]]'s movements, who has mustered an army for battle. Rhaenyra decides to not to take action, to Jace's chagrin.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

During a Black Council meeting, Baela reports the findings of Criston Cole's army heading towards the Riverlands. Jace defends Baela when [[Alfred Broome]] grudgingly expresses that she should have burned Cole and his men, as they only possess any information because of Baela's efforts. Ser Alfred disrespects Rhaenys's efforts to lead the meeting before Jace tells him to mind his tongue. The meeting concludes with the wish to end the [[Dance of the Dragons|conflict]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Jace suggests sending a dragon to [[Rook's Rest]] before Rhaenyra arrives to the meeting. Jace sharply informs his mother of the needed support from her vassals fighting her war. He then inquires on Rhaenyra's whereabouts in the past days, who explains that she traveled to King's Landing to sue for peace with Queen Alicent. Jace briefly protests her journey to King's Landing as an unnecessary risk, but assures everyone stands with her still. Jace insists on sending a dragon to protect Lord [[Simon Staunton]]'s keep. When Rhaenyra decides to fly to Rook's Rest, Jace counsels her not to, and proposes for him to be sent on Vermax, but Rhaenyra reminds him of his lack of experience. Rhaenys decides to go on Meleys and burn Cole's army.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Before the battle, as Jace protests Rhaenyra let him fight to secure her claim and his to the Iron Throne, she tells him, as her heir, of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]'s dream, "The Song of Ice and Fire." Jace now holds a responsibility that has been passed from king to heir.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

Jace walks in the library of Dragonstone where he finds his betrothed Baela reading. He intends to fly to Harrenhal to confront Daemon about his loyalty to Rhaenyra and to report his course of action. Baela tries convincing him to stay as Daemon is unpredictable. However, Jace still wishes to participate in the war, scouting or fighting for his mother but Baela reassures him that Rhaenyra is protecting him, but he insists on taking action for his and his mother's claim to the Iron Throne. He then plans to treat with [[House Frey]], who control the crossing at the [[Twins]], which Cregan Stark's greybeards need to march south. Baela comments that Rhaenyra will not savor his leave, and he says not to tell her till he is absent.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

At the Twins, Jace sits at a table with the lord and lady of House Frey. They take note on Lord [[Grover Tully]]'s declaration for Rhaenyra not having been answered. Jace negotiates that it is treason to not answer Rhaenyra's call to war and that he needs the Twins' passage for the [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|Stark]] army. House Frey does not fear Queen Rhaenyra or Lord Tully's hesitance to join the fray, but they do fear Vhagar. Jace is surprised that they fear Vhagar when Vermax is outside the Twins' walls. He offers his protection to House Frey against any attack from the Greens or his uncle Daemon, who will do as Rhaenyra commands. When the Freys wish to possess Harrenhal, Jace declares that for that they will have to bend the knee to Rhaenyra. The meeting concludes with an agreement and Jace acquiring House Frey to the Blacks. He walks to Vermax and heads back to Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

Jace meets with Rhaenyra upon his arrival. He notices that she is reading a book about [[Visenya Targaryen]], and suspects that his mother will use her ancestor as an example, rebuking that it was many years ago. He informs his mother of his successful diplomatic efforts at the Twins and that House Frey wishes to acquire Harrenhal at war's end. Rhaenyra expresses that she is proud of him but he states that she looks angry. She expresses her frustration over not fighting for her ascension to the throne while he has. Jace listens to his mother's frustrations and is advised to stay out of danger. After a long conversation, Jace suggests that the [[Blacks]] recruit their two largest dragons to the cause: [[Vermithor]] and [[Silverwing]]. He proposes Rhaena claims one of the dragons but is dismissed as she failed on her last attempt. On Jace's suggestion, they decide to gather [[dragonseed]]s for the riderless dragons at Dragonstone.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==Personality==
Jace is good-natured. He wants to be a successful, respected ruler, and is willing to do whatever it takes to defend his family and his claim to the Iron Throne.{{Guideref|Jacaerys Velaryon}} He is not concerned with the whispers of the royal court surrounding his legitimacy.{{Ref|HOTD108}}
