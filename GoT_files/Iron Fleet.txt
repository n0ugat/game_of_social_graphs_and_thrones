The '''Iron Fleet'''{{Ref|GOT605}} was the fleet of [[Ships|warships]] of the [[Iron Islands]] under the command of [[House Greyjoy]].

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Greyjoy Rebellion.png|left|thumb|[[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] sent the Iron fleet to start his [[Greyjoy Rebellion|Rebellion]].]]

At the [[kingsmoot on Old Wyk]], [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] vows to build the "mightiest fleet" to conquer the mainland. However, she is outmaneuvered by her uncle Euron, who advocates forging an alliance with [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] in order to gain access to her [[dragon]]s. While Euron is being baptized by [[Aeron Greyjoy]], Yara, Theon, and their supporters flee on the best ships in the Iron Fleet. In response, Euron orders his supporters to build another fleet and to kill his niece and nephew.<ref>"[[The Door]]"</ref>

Yara and Theon's Iron Fleet sails to [[Essos]] with the intention of beating Euron to Daenerys, who lives in [[Meereen]] in [[Slaver's Bay]].<ref>"[[The Broken Man]]"</ref> At Meereen, Yara and Theon forge an alliance with Daenerys and her advisor [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. In return for recognizing the independence of the [[Iron Islands]] and helping them to overthrow Euron, Yara agrees to ferry Daenerys's army to [[Westeros]] and to cease raiding the mainland.<ref>"[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"</ref> Later, the Iron Fleet is seen sailing as part of a combined Targaryen armada to invade Westeros.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
After Yara and Theon abscond with their best ships, Euron considers his remaining bulk of the Iron Islands' naval forces to be the ''real'' "Iron Fleet" and refers to it as such.{{Note|Both [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] and Stannis considered their own fleets to be ''the'' "royal fleet" when they faced each other.}}

[[File:The-Silence.png|thumb|right|''Silence'' leads the Iron Fleet to King's Landing.]]After [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] declares herself queen, Euron arrives in [[King's Landing]] to offer her a marriage-alliance and his Iron Fleet. Cersei is skeptical of Euron's trustworthiness; he sees her point, and departs offering that he will return with a great gift to prove his worth.<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

The Iron Fleet, under Euron's command and having just left King's Landing, [[Assault on the Targaryen fleet|attacks a portion of the Targaryen fleet under Yara's command]] as it leaves [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], heading to Dorne. Euron's ships launch fireballs into Yara's, crippling the Targaryen fleet and giving naval superiority to the Iron Fleet.<ref name="E62">"[[Stormborn]]"</ref>

The Iron Fleet returns to King's Landing. Euron delivers [[Ellaria Sand|Ellaria]] and [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]] to Cersei, fulfilling his promise of a gift by handing her the people responsible for the death of [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]]. Cersei is pleased and, in turn, promises to grant his request of marriage ''after'' the war is won. Euron is eventually ordered to set sail again and lead the Iron Fleet west to [[Casterly Rock]], where he [[Fall of Casterly Rock|attacks and destroys the remainders of Daenerys's fleet]] who are besieging the Rock.<ref>"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref>

While Euron and Cersei take part in the [[Dragonpit Summit]], the entire Iron Fleet is docked in Blackwater Bay. After Euron witnesses a [[wight]] firsthand, he claims to be leaving in fear and taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands. However, Euron secretly takes the Iron Fleet to Essos under Cersei's orders, with the intent of transporting the [[Golden Company]] to Westeros to fight for Cersei.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
The Iron Fleet successfully ferries the Golden Company to Westeros and anchors in Blackwater Bay.<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

While the Targaryen fleet is returning to Dragonstone, eleven of the Iron Fleet [[Battle at Dragonstone|ambush]] them. They manage to kill [[Rhaegal]] using [[Scorpion]]s, but miss [[Drogon]]. Euron then has them focus their attacks on the Targaryen fleet, wiping out much of it in the process and capturing [[Missandei]].<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref>

The Iron Fleet, including the ''Silence'', is wiped out by Drogon during the [[Battle of King's Landing]].<ref>"[[The Bells]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Iron Fleet is the elite naval force of the ironborn. It consists of around a hundred warships dipping 100 oars or more. It is one of the three most powerful fleets of Westeros, along with the [[royal fleet]] of the crownlands and the [[Redwyne fleet]] of the [[Arbor]].

In contrast to the show, the Iron Fleet is not the entirety or the majority of the ironborn naval forces, which according to a semi-canon source, consist of about 500 longships. However, most of these ships only dip 20 oars and are meant for coastal raiding, not pitched naval battles and ship-to-ship engagements. The Iron Fleet is a permanent military force held to belong to the Iron Islands as a whole, not individual captains or houses.

The Iron Fleet spearheads any major military action. Its job is to destroy or pin larger enemy ships, allowing smaller longships to land on the enemy shores. The Iron Fleet was comprehensively defeated in a sea battle off Fair Isle during the Greyjoy Rebellion, when the royal fleet under Stannis and the Redwyne fleet under Lord [[Paxter Redwyne]] trapped it in a pincer movement and destroyed it. This allowed the royalist forces to [[Siege of Pyke|attack Pyke]] and end the war.

Since the end of the Greyjoy Rebellion, the Iron Fleet has been rebuilt to its former size. It is commanded by Victarion Greyjoy (who has been omitted from the show) from his flagship, the ''Iron Victory''.

Following Balon's death, a Kingsmoot is held; Euron is proclaimed King of the Iron Islands. Euron then embarks on a massive campaign to conquer Westeros, beginning with the [[Shield Islands]] in the [[Reach]]. While a section of the Iron Fleet under Victarion draws the Shield Islanders' fleet away from the islands, a larger ironborn force under Euron raids and pillages the Shields.

Asha (Yara's name in the books) does not steal the Iron Fleet or any part of it. She returns to [[Deepwood Motte]] with the four ships she originally had. 

After capturing Oakenshield, Euron sends the Iron fleet, under the command of Victarion, on a mission to bring him Daenerys from Meereen. Unlike in the TV series, Euron intends to marry her, not Cersei, as his Queen.

Unlike in the show, while the Iron fleet is away, Euron does not order to build even one additional ship (let alone one thousand), because he still has hundreds of ships at his disposal - sufficiently for the next stage of his campaign against the Reach.

At the beginning of the voyage to the Slaver's Bay, the Iron fleet consists of 93 ships; nearly half of them are lost on the way, but Victarion does not despair. The remaining fleet continues, capturing several cogs and galleys along the way. By the time the fleet reaches Meereen, it consists of 61 ships.
