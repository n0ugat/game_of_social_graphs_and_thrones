{{Quote|One suicidal lord even wanted to ambush Aegon's camp in the dark and kill the dragons as they slept, or at the very least their riders. Hard to tell what would have been his fate. Burning? Beheading? Dismemberment? Perhaps all three.|[[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]]|House Stark, The Kings of Winter}}
'''Brandon Snow'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the [[bastard]] half-brother of [[Torrhen Stark]], the [[King in the North|King of Winter]].

==Biography==
[[Torrhen Stark]]'s army reached the [[Trident]] and saw that [[Aegon I Targaryen]]'s force was larger than theirs by half and had three [[dragon]]s. Torrhen called a conference of his [[Lordship|lords]] and advisors that night and Brandon suggested ambushing Aegon's camp and killing his dragons, [[Balerion]], [[Vhagar]], and [[Meraxes]], or at least killing Aegon and his sisters [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]]. However, Torrhen dismissed this idea and instead [[Bending the knee|bent the knee]] to Aegon, forever becoming known as "the King Who Knelt".{{Ref|C&R06}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Brandon Snow's story is the same. Once Torrhen had dismissed his planned assassination attempt in the Targaryen camp, he sent Brandon and three [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] to negotiate with Aegon, before swearing fealty to Aegon the following day.

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', [[Bran Stark|Bran]] has a [[Sight|vision]] through [[Winterfell]]'s [[heart tree]], in which he sees a pale, fierce, dark-eyed young man slicing three branches off the [[weirwood]] and shaping them into arrows. There is a fan speculation that man is Brandon Snow, creating arrows with which to kill Aegon's dragons.
