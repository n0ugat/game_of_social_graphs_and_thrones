The '''Lord of Karhold'''{{Ref|GOT305}} is a title held by the head of [[House Karstark]] and ruler of [[Karhold]]. The title was held by [[Rickard Karstark]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]] until he was beheaded by [[King in the North]] [[Robb Stark]] under charges of treason.<ref>"[[Kissed by Fire]]"</ref> [[Harald Karstark]] ascended to lordship afterwards.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/spoiler-country-game-of-thrones-casting-for-a-rugged-type-character-confirmations-and-an-intriguing-nikolaj-coster-waldau-rumor/ Watchers on the Wall — Northern Lord Confirmations]</ref> During the [[Battle of the Bastards]], Harald Karstark is killed in battle and then his daughter, [[Alys Karstark]], becomes the Lady of Karhold.

The holder rules the castle [[Karhold]] and its surrounding lands, a heavily forested area overlooking the [[Shivering Sea]]. The title is traditionally held by a member of [[House Karstark]]. Karhold lies in the [[North]], and its holder therefore swears fealty to the [[Warden of the North]], whoever they may be.
