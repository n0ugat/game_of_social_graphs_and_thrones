==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jacks is a similar minor character. He is a member of the household guard at Winterfell.

Jacks is one of the guards who accompany [[Eddard Stark]] to [[King's Landing]]. He and [[Varly]] escort Eddard when he visits the armorer [[Tobho Mott]] and discovers [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], one of [[Robert Baratheon]]'s bastard.

He is one of the few survivors of the [[Massacre in the Red Keep|massacre of the Stark household]]. He is later sent with [[Alton Lannister#In the books|Cleos Frey]] to the Starks' camp, to deliver [[Tyrion Lannister]]'s counterterms and Eddard's bones. He is then put under the command of [[Hallis Mollen]].

He is sent north with Hallis Mollen's men to escort Eddard's bones back to Winterfell. Before they reach [[Moat Cailin]], however, the [[Ironborn invasion of the North|ironborn invade the North]]. It is unknown what has become of Jacks and the rest of the party; unlike in the show, Eddard's bones have not been brought yet to Winterfell.
