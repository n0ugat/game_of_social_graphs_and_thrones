{{Quote|My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion.|The knight to [[Lysa Arryn]]|A Golden Crown}}
A '''knight of House Lynderly''' was at court in the [[Eyrie]] in [[298 AC]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
The knight is present when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] demands a [[First trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] for the charges of murdering [[Jon Arryn]] and conspiring to murder [[Bran Stark]]. He's the first to offer himself as the champion for [[Lysa Arryn]], followed by [[Eon Hunter]] and other men. However, Lysa chooses Ser [[Vardis Egen]] as her champion.{{Ref|GOT106}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, a member of House Lynderly of Snakewood is the first to offer himself as Lysa Tully's champion; Tyrion, however, doesn't recognize the Lynderly's identity, thus it is unclear whether he is Jon Lynderly, Lymond Lynderly, or someone else that hasn't been named.
