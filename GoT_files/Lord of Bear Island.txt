'''Lord of Bear Island'''{{Con|ASOIAF}}{{Note|Feminine: '''Lady of Bear Island'''{{Ref|GOT502}}}} is a title held by the ruler of the [[Bear Island]] in the [[North]]. The role is traditionally held by the head of [[House Mormont]], a vassal of [[House Stark]]. The last known Lady of Bear Island was [[Lyanna Mormont]].

==Known Lords of Bear Island==
*?{{Note|Jeor was still Lord of Bear Island at the time of the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] in 289 AC since his son fought in the war and was not yet lord ("[[Kissed by Fire]]").}} AC: {[[Jeor Mormont]]}, abdicated in favor of his son to join the [[Night's Watch]]
*? AC: {[[Jorah Mormont]]}, son of Jeor, stripped of his lordship after being caught selling poachers into slavery
*?{{Note|Maege was Lady of Bear Island at the beginning of the [[War of the Five Kings]] ("[[The Pointy End]]") but was dead by the time of [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s campaign in the North ("[[The House of Black and White]]").}} AC: {[[Maege Mormont]]}, sister of Jeor
*?–305 AC: {[[Lyanna Mormont]]}, daughter of Maege

==In the books==
In the novels, it is unknown if [[Maege Mormont]] is still alive (it is implied by her second daughter Alysane that she is), but she actually had three surviving daughters who were older than Lyanna, her youngest. [[Jon Snow]] himself wonders why Lyanna Mormont was the one who wrote the reply letter to Stannis (it is possible the Mormonts let her write it to scorn [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]).

Lyanna is apparently the ''acting'' "Lady of Bear Island", while her mother and sisters are away, similar to how [[Bran Stark]] was the acting "[[Lord of Winterfell]]" in Season 2, when his older brother Robb was not physically present to rule.
