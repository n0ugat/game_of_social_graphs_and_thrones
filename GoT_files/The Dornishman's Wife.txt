"'''The Dornishman's Wife'''"{{Ref|GOT506}} is a popular and ribald song in [[Westeros]]. It is from the perspective of a man who had sexual relations with a Dornishman's wife and was apparently mortally wounded by her husband.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
On the way to the [[Water Gardens]] of [[Dorne]], [[Bronn]] sings the song, until [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] interrupts him just as, according to Bronn, he is "coming to the best part", since the song is "all about the ending."{{Ref|GOT506}} Later, in jail at the Water Gardens, Bronn sings the whole song as the [[Sand Snakes]] listen in an adjacent cell with a mixture of annoyance from [[Obara Sand|Obara]] and [[Nymeria Sand|Nymeria]] and amusement from [[Tyene Sand|Tyene]].{{Ref|GOT507}}

==Lyrics==
From "[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]":
:''The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun''
:''And her kisses were warmer than spring''
:''The Dornishman's blade was made of black steel''
:''And its kiss was a terrible thing''
:''The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed''
:''In a voice that was sweet as a peach ''
From "[[The Gift]]":
:''Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done''
:''The Dornishman's taken my life''
:''But what does it matter? For all men must die''
:''And I've tasted the Dornishman's wife, I have''
:''I've tasted the Dornishman's wife''

== In the books ==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, [[Mance Rayder]] sings the song when [[Jon Snow|Jon]] enters his tent for the first time.{{Bookref|ASOS|7}} Jon remembers it while Mance (actually, the [[Lord of Bones]] in disguise) is executed.{{Bookref|ADWD|10}}

Mance, disguised as "Abel the bard", sings it at [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay]]'s wedding, but with a slight change: instead of tasting a Dornishman's wife, he sings of tasting a northman's daughter. [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] thinks that the singer may lose his tongue (and other body parts) for that, but [[Roose Bolton|Roose]] smiles and Ramsay laughs aloud.{{Bookref|ADWD|41}}

In the books, the complete lyrics are:

:''The Dornishman's wife was as fair as the sun,''
:''and her kisses were warmer than spring.''
:''But the Dornishman's blade was made of black steel,''
:''and its kiss was a terrible thing.''
:''The Dornishman's wife would sing as she bathed,''
:''in a voice that was sweet as a peach,''
:''But the Dornishman's blade had a song of its own,''
:''and a bite sharp and cold as a leech.''
:''As he lay on the ground with the darkness around,''
:''and the taste of his blood on his tongue,''
:''His brothers knelt by him and prayed him a prayer,''
:''and he smiled and he laughed and he sung,''
:''"Brothers, oh brothers, my days here are done,''
:''the Dornishman's taken my life,''
:''But what does it matter, for all men must die,''
:''and I've tasted the Dornishman's wife!"''
