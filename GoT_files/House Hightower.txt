==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Hightower is a powerful family with strong ties to the Tyrells. The family is very old, existing since the Dawn of Days when they were petty-kings. During the coming of the [[Andals]] and the creation of the Kingdom of the Reach, the Hightowers allied with the newcomers. Thus, they were able to keep their wealth, lands, and privileges. House Hightower rarely takes part in wars within the realm. They were integral in the foundation of the [[Citadel]] and continue to be patrons of both the Order of Maesters and the [[Faith of the Seven]].

House Hightower is said to be as rich as [[House Lannister]] and can field three times as many swords as other Tyrell bannermen, as they have vassals of their own, such as House Cuy; more, if they took everyone possible out of [[Oldtown]]. The four-decked ''Honor of Oldtown'' is the flagship of the Hightower fleet. 

In contrast to the prominence and political involvement House Hightower had in the Targaryen era, its role is not very significant in the Baratheon era. In the [[War of the Five Kings]], the Hightowers have followed the Tyrell's lead, declaring for [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] on the outbreak of the conflict, and not changing to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'s side after Renly's assassination.

As [[Euron Greyjoy]]'s military campaign against the Reach progresses, the Hightowers regard the threat seriously (in contrast to Cersei). While waiting for [[Paxter Redwyne]] to return from [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] with the [[Redwyne fleet]], they prepare to fight the [[ironborn]] invaders: the lord and his daughter Malora research spellbooks; Baelor builds galleys; Gunthor builds up the harbor's defenses; Garth is training new recruits; Humfrey travels to his sister Lynesse at [[Lys]], to hire sellsails.{{Bookref|AFFC|45}}

The house is led by Lord Leyton Hightower. The sigil of House Hightower is a stone white watchtower, with a fire on the top (the color of the flame is not specified). Their words are "We Light the Way".
