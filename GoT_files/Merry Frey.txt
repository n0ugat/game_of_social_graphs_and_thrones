'''Merry Frey''' is one of the many granddaughters of [[Walder Frey]], the [[Lord of the Crossing]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Along with several of Lord Frey's other daughters and granddaughters, [[Robb Stark]] had the option of marrying her. When he arrives at the [[Twins]] for his uncle [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]]'s [[Red Wedding|wedding]], Robb apologizes for his slight against them. When introducing Merry, Lord Walder calls her Wertha, Walra, and Waldina before she meekly corrects him, though he quickly dismisses her. However, during the wedding feast she sits at the main table alongside Walder Frey's [[Joyeuse Frey|wife]], Lord Walder himself, and the newlywed couple - the only one of Lord Walder's children (other than the bride [[Roslin Tully|Roslin]]) to sit as his table during the wedding.{{Ref|GOT309}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
While her grandfather, [[Walder Frey]], is yelling at his sons, [[Walder Rivers|"Black" Walder Rivers]] and [[Lothar Frey|Lothar]], Merry can briefly be seen feasting in the hall of the [[Twins]] with her relatives.{{Ref|GOT606}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Merry is among the female Freys serving wine to the male relatives at "Walder's" banquet. She is seen horrified watching the men succumb to poison in the wine, and as Walder Frey turns out to really be [[Arya Stark]] wearing his face.{{Ref|GOT701}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is a granddaughter of Lord Walder named Merianne Frey, who is also known as Merry, who is eleven years old (not to be confused with Marianne Vance, daughter of Walder's daughter Maegelle, whose first name is spelled with an "a" not an "e"). She is the daughter of Ser Whalen Frey and Sylwa Paege. Whalen is the third child of Lord Walder's fourth wife, Alyssa Blackwood. [[Lothar Frey|Lame Lothar Frey]] is Walder's eldest child with Alyssa, making him Whalen's older brother and Merianne's uncle.

Merry was one of the Frey women presented to Robb Stark when he came to the Twins for Lord Edmure Tully's wedding. When she corrects her grandfather on her name, he refers to her as "Noisy", rather than dismissing her.
