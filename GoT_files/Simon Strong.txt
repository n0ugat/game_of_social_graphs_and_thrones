Ser '''Simon Strong''' is a [[Knighthood|knight]] of [[House Strong]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Simon is the uncle of [[Lyonel Strong]] and granduncle of [[Larys Strong]] and [[Harwin Strong]]. He serves as the [[castellan]] of [[Harrenhal]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:2x4 Simon Strong Still.jpg|thumb|Ser Simon aides Daemon in raising an army.]]
When Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] and his [[dragon]] [[Caraxes]] arrive at Harrenhal to claim the castle for the [[Blacks]], Ser Simon hastily bends the knee and declares his allegiance to Queen [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]], inviting Daemon to dine with him. Over dinner, Simon assures Daemon, who refuses to touch his plate, that the food isn't poisoned and he is welcome in the castle. When Daemon questions Simon's submission, given the lord of his house has declared for [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], Simon brands his great-nephew Larys a scourge on their family, making it clear he believes Larys [[Kinslaying|murdered]] [[Lyonel Strong|his father]] and [[Harwin Strong|brother]] to claim lordship of Harrenhal, noting the suspicious nature of the fire that claimed their lives. Simon then converses with Daemon about making [[House Tully/House of the Dragon|House Tully]] declare for the Blacks.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Simon awakens Daemon from a nightmare to inform him that a [[raven]] has arrived, warning [[Criston Cole]]'s army has departed King's Landing, Houses [[House Rosby|Rosby]] and [[House Stokeworth|Stokeworth]] have defected to the [[Greens]] and added their forces to Cole's, and Cole is likely making for Harrenhal. Simon expresses his concern even if Daemon can raise an army in the Riverlands, it may not be ready in time to face Cole. Simon also introduces Daemon to [[Oscar Tully]], grandson and heir to Lord [[Grover Tully]]. After Oscar informs Daemon of his grandfather's deteriorating health and his lack of authority to speak in Grover's stead, Daemon mocks House Tully as "a fish without a head" to Simon and questions which side in the [[Battle at the Burning Mill|recent clash]] between Houses [[House Blackwood|Blackwood]] and [[House Bracken|Bracken]] declared for Rhaenyra. Once informed the Brackens declared for Aegon, Daemon orders Simon to summon the Blackwoods to Harrenhal. Simon is later present when Daemon negotiates with Ser [[Willem Blackwood]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}
