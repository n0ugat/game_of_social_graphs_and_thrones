{{Quote|My sweet boys. Petyr, Tommard, Edric...|Queen [[Selyse Baratheon]]|Kissed by Fire}}
'''Edric Baratheon''' was the third son of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Selyse Baratheon]], the younger brother of Petyr Baratheon and Tommard Baratheon, and the older brother of [[Shireen Baratheon]], who died during childbirth. His mother keeps his corpse in a glass jar on display in her chamber along with his other stillborn brothers, [[Tommard Baratheon|Tommard]] and [[Petyr Baratheon|Petyr]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Selyse had given birth to three stillborn sons, one of whom was Edric. She sealed their bodies in glass jars.{{Ref|GOT305}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
While trying to seduce Stannis, [[Melisandre]] convinces him that his wife had failed to give him a son, only stillborns, referring to Edric and his two brothers.{{Ref|GOT202}}

==Behind the scenes==
Staff writer [[Bryan Cogman]] came up with the idea of the stillborn fetuses being preserved in jars. Cogman said in an interview, "''It was a proud day for me as a writer when I walked on set and saw those magnificently nasty prop dead babies floating in those jars.''"<ref>[http://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/episodes/3/25-kissed-by-fire/interview/bryan-cogman.html HBO: Game of Thrones: Interview With Bryan Cogman]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention Selyse Baratheon having any sons, live or stillborn.

He shares a name with King Robert's only acknowledged [[bastard]] from the novels: Edric Storm. For the TV series, Edric Storm's storyline in the third novel is merged with [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]'s.
