A '''rebellion'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is an organized uprising against a sovereign or liege, with the goal of overthrowing the established authority. Some rebellions are fought to seize control of a throne, or to gain independence.

In the [[Seven Kingdoms]], it is considered a serious crime and an act of [[treason]] and [[oathbreaking]].

==Major rebellions==
*During [[Aegon's Conquest]], most of the [[Riverlands|riverlords]] rose in rebellion against their liege, the Ironborn King [[Harren Hoare|Harren the Black]]. The foremost of the rebels, [[Edmyn Tully]] of [[Riverrun]], was named [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]] by Aegon after Harren's [[Burning of Harrenhal|death]].
* The [[Faith Militant uprising]] was a rebellion against [[House Targaryen]] that sprung from the [[Incest|incestuous]] [[marriage]] of [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aenys)|Rhaena Targaryen]], the elder children of King [[Aenys Targaryen]]. It ended with the death of Aenys's half-brother and successor [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]], who was found dead on the [[Iron Throne]] after a series of betrayals. Afterward, Maegor's nephew [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] spent a period of his reign reconciling the [[Faith of the Seven|Faith]] and the Crown, although [[Alysanne Targaryen|continuing]] the [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] tradition of marrying brother to sister.
* The [[Blackfyre Rebellion]] was led by [[Daemon Blackfyre]], one of the legitimized [[Great Bastards]] of [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]]. After his [[legitimization]], Daemon proclaimed himself the rightful heir and rebelled against his half-brother [[Daeron II Targaryen]]. Daemon was slain by [[Brynden Rivers]] at the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]], ending the war. This rebellion gave birth to the [[Golden Company]], a [[Mercenary|sellsword]] company of [[Exile|exiled]] supporters of the [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyres]].
* The [[Reyne-Tarbeck revolt]] was an uprising localized in the [[Westerlands]], in which [[House Reyne]] of [[Castamere]] sought to overthrow its overlord, House Lannister of [[Casterly Rock]]. This was due to the deteriorating strength of House Lannister caused by the current [[Warden of the West]], [[Tytos Lannister]], who was considered weak. It resulted in the complete elimination of House Reyne and the destruction of Castamere at the orders of [[Tywin Lannister]]. House Lannister's victory is immortalized in the song "[[The Rains of Castamere]]."
* The [[Defiance of Duskendale]] was a rebellion by [[House Darklyn]] of [[Duskendale]] that almost took the life of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. The knights [[Gwayne Gaunt]] and [[Symon Hollard]] were slain during the conflict. [[Denys Darklyn]] was executed by the Mad King.
* [[Robert's Rebellion]] was a major uprising against the royal house that turned into civil war as it involved eight of the nine great houses of [[Westeros]]. Houses [[House Baratheon|Baratheon]], [[House Stark|Stark]], [[House Arryn|Arryn]] and [[House Tully|Tully]] rebelled against House Targaryen, which was supported by Houses [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] and [[House Martell|Martell]], after Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]] [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] [[Lyanna Stark]] and King Aerys II [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|executed]] her father [[Rickard Stark|Rickard]] and brother [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]]. The tide of war turned against the royal house after the [[Battle of the Trident]] while the fate of the royal family was sealed when House Lannister joined the rebels and carried out the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. It resulted in the elevation of [[Robert Baratheon]] to the Iron Throne.
* The [[Greyjoy Rebellion]] was an uprising led by [[Balon Greyjoy]], [[Lord Reaper of Pyke]], who crowned himself [[King of the Iron Islands]] with the goal of seceding his domain from the Seven Kingdoms and restoring the [[Ironborn]]'s [[Old Way]]. It resulted in defeat of the rebels and the cementing of Robert's authority.
* The [[War of the Five Kings]] involves several rebellions against the Iron Throne. Both the [[North]] and [[Iron Islands]] rebel against King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] with the goal of independence. In the meantime, both [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] and [[Stannis Baratheon]] are held as rebels and pretenders as they both lay claim to the crown in defiance of Joffrey, who is held as the rightful heir of the late Robert. Ultimately all of the five kings in the war are killed, but nonetheless, rebellions continue.
** The War for the North, which is regarded as part of the War of the Five Kings, was a rebellion against [[House Bolton]] led by [[Jon Snow]] and [[Sansa Stark]] that began shortly after Stannis Baratheon's failed campaign in the North. It ended with the [[Battle of the Bastards]], in which House Arryn played the decisive role in House Stark's victory over the Boltons.
* The [[shadow war]] was a [[Slavery|slaver]] rebellion against [[Daenerys Targaryen]] spearheaded by the insurgent group known as the [[Sons of the Harpy]]. The rebellion ended the lives of Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]], Daenerys's [[Kingsguard|Queensguard]] and betrothed respectively. Although the uprising was temporarily silenced when the slave masters of [[Astapor]], [[Yunkai]], and [[Volantis]] agreed to cease funding, hostilities were restored – and ended – during the [[second siege of Meereen]], the climactic battle of the [[Liberation of Slaver's Bay]].
