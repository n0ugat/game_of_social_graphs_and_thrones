{{Quote|An elder brother objected, so an elder brother fell off a horse and at the kingsmoot no man objected.|[[Euron Greyjoy]]|The Kingsmoot}}
Prince '''Harlan Hoare'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the son of [[Qhorwyn Hoare]], [[King of the Iron Islands]].

==Biography==
Following his [[Qhorwyn Hoare|father]]'s death, Harlan was made a candidate at the [[kingsmoot]]. However, his disgraced brother [[Harwyn Hoare]] returned from [[Essos]] to claim the [[Salt Throne]], but Harlan objected to this claim. Under mysterious circumstances, Harlan died after falling from his horse. No man at the [[kingsmoot]] objected to Harwyn's rule after that.{{Ref|H&L602}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Harlan was the heir of King Qhorwyn the Cunning, since Qhorwyn's eldest son had died from [[greyscale]]. Harlan died suddenly shortly after Qhorwyn's death, alledgedly by falling from a [[horse]]. Some believed Harlan's younger brother [[Harwyn Hoare|Harwyn]] to be responsible, though others suspected that a [[Faceless Men|Faceless Man]] had killed Harlan.
