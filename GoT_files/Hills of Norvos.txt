The '''Hills of Norvos'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} are an extensive range of tall hills and mountains located at the north-western end of the continent of [[Essos]]. They extend from the mainland just south of [[Braavos]] along the north coast as far east as the headland known as the [[Axe]]. The extend south almost as far as [[Dagger Lake]].

The hills are named for the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Norvos]], which is the largest city in the area. The headwaters of most of the major tributaries of the [[Rhoyne]] form in these hills.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Hills of Norvos are part of an immense region of hills and mountains which dominates the northwestern corner of Essos. This region extends for several hundred miles from just south of [[Braavos]], encompassing much of the territory east to [[Qohor]] and south along the [[Rhoyne]] and its tributaries.  

The Velvet Hills near [[Pentos]] are an off-shoot of this range (sometimes alternatively called the "Hills of Andalos" in some versions of the text).
