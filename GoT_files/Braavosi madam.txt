A '''Braavosi madam''' is the proprietress, or at least a senior procuress, of a brothel in [[Braavos]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
The Braavosi Madam is present when Ser [[Meryn Trant]] visits the brothel she works in, seeking for a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. She presents three prostitutes to him, but he claims that they are all too old. Realizing with some distaste what Trant is seeking, she presents him with a [[Aya|very young serving girl]]. Trant informs the madam that he expects a "fresh" one tomorrow night, again to her distaste. Throughout the exchange, the Madam is vexed by the presence of [[Arya Stark|Lanna]], a young oyster-seller, so deep in the brothel, and warns her not to show up there again.{{Ref|GOT509}}
