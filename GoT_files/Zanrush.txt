Or will you take up her flames yourselves? Will you burn away the chains and the nonbelievers who make them?

'''Zanrush'''<ref>http://dedalvs.tumblr.com/post/143383597638/valyrian-and-dothraki-dialogue-episode-601-of</ref> is a [[red priest]] of the [[Lord of Light]], based in the city of [[Meereen]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Varys]] listen to Zanrush preaching his message to a crowd of Meereenese freedmen. The red priest wants the populace to follow Daenerys's example in her absence and free themselves from the tyranny of the masters.{{Ref|GOT601}}

When [[Kinvara]] comes to the [[Great Pyramid of Meereen]] to speak with Tyrion and Varys, Zanrush announces her, listing her titles, then steps aside while the others converse.{{Ref|GOT605}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, by the point the books have reached, there is no mention of a character named Zanrush or of red priests in Meereen, though at least one is in transit.
