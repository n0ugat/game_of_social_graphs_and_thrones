'''Weirwood'''{{Ref|GOT107}} is a species of deciduous tree found all over [[Westeros]]; it has white bark with five-pointed, blood-red leaves and sap. The [[heart tree]]s are weirwood trees with faces carved on their barks found in the center of [[godswood]]s. The [[Children of the Forest]] are thought to have carved the faces that decorated the heart trees.<ref name="VG Dawn Age">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/appendix/beyond-the-houses/ HBO Viewer's Guide, Season 2 appendices, Westeros Through the Ages - Dawn Age entry]</ref>

According to [[Alys Rivers]], weirwoods are imbued with the spirits of ancient people, and their whispers can still be heard sometimes.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

==History==
[[File:Night's_Watch_vows.jpg|thumb|Night's Watch recruits taking their vows before a weirwood.]]
During the [[coming of the Andals]] six thousand years ago, the Andals cut down most of the weirwood trees in southern Westeros, to suppress worship of the Old Gods in favor of the Andals' new religion, the [[Faith of the Seven]]. The only weirwoods still in the south are the handful of heart trees that survived in castle godswoods that were converted to secular gardens, instead of being destroyed. Weirwoods also survive in southern Westeros on the [[Isle of Faces]] in [[Gods Eye]] lake, in the southern [[Riverlands]]. Weirwoods still grow in significant numbers, but only in the forests of the North. [[Beyond the Wall]], they are even more prevalent.<ref>''[[Histories & Lore|Complete Guide to Westeros]]'': "The Old Gods and the New"</ref>

The area around the weirwood where [[Bran Stark]] meets [[Brynden Rivers]] is shown to destroy wights. It is stated by a [[Leaf|child of the forest]] that they "hold no power here", though it is unclear whether it is because of the tree, the reason why the tree is there, or some other factor.<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
The "weir" in weirwood is a reference to musician [[Wikipedia:Bob Weir|Bob Weir]], a member of the band [[Wikipedia:Grateful Dead|Grateful Dead]].<ref>[https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/george-rr-martin-confirms-grateful-793202/ George R.R. Martin Confirms Grateful Dead Influence on ‘Game of Thrones’]</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, weirwood trees live an extremely long time, and even when they die they do not rot. Objects made of weirwood are as lasting as stone. This is how the faces in the weirwood trees could actually be carved by the Children of the Forest, even though they disappeared six thousand years ago. Weirwood trees like the ones in the Winterfell godswood are thousands of years old. Even dead weirwood trees like the one at House Blackwood's seat of Raventree Hall can remain freestanding for thousands of years after they die.
