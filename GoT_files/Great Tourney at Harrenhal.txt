The '''Great Tourney at Harrenhal'''{{Ref|H&L605}} was the largest [[tournament]] held in the history of [[Westeros]]. Hosted by Lord [[Walter Whent]] in the [[Year of the False Spring]], the tourney proved fateful for the future of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], as Crown Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] crowned [[Lyanna Stark]] the [[queen of love and beauty]] at the end, forsaking his wife [[Elia Martell]] and leading to [[Robert's Rebellion]].

==History==
===Background===
During the Year of the False Spring, in the height of summer, Walter Whent hosted the largest tourney in the history of Westeros, attracting knights and lords from across the Seven Kingdoms with its spectacle and large champion's purse. Some believe that the entire tourney had in fact been organized by Rhaegar to gather the great lords of Westeros and address the madness of his father [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]], perhaps even to remove him from the [[Iron Throne]].<ref name="TH">"[[The Great Tourney at Harrenhal]]"</ref>

===The tourney===
At the onset of the tourney, the young Lord [[Howland Reed]] was assaulted by squires to knights from houses [[House Frey|Frey]], [[House Haigh|Haigh]], and [[House Blount|Blount]], but was saved by Lyanna, the fierce and willful daughter of [[Rickard Stark]], the [[Warden of the North]]. During the evening, a feast was held to mark the opening of the tourney. Lord Howland attended at the behest of Lyanna and her brothers [[Brandon Stark|Brandon]], [[Eddard Stark|Eddard]], and [[Benjen Stark|Benjen]]. There, a brother of the [[Night's Watch]] attempted to recruit knights for the order, only to be met with snickers and smiles. Rhaegar played his harp and sang a song so sad that it brought tears to Lyanna. When Benjen teased her, she poured a cup of wine over his head, while Lord [[Robert Baratheon]] defeated Ser [[Richard Lonmouth]] in a wine drinking game. Meanwhile, the beautiful [[Ashara Dayne]] danced with Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] and several others, including the shy Eddard, after Brandon had asked for the last dance on his behalf.<ref name="TH" />

However, the hall soon went quiet as Aerys entered with his [[Kingsguard]]. Having not left the [[Red Keep]] in years, he shocked everyone with his long yellow fingernails, tangled beard and unwashed matted hair. He would go from hysterical laughter to weeping to rage within moments, making his madness plain for all to see. However, a cheer burst from the crowd as he called forth Ser [[Jaime Lannister]] to kneel before him and swear the oath of the Kingsguard before half the lords of the Seven Kingdoms, as Jaime was admired for his courage, gallantry and swordsmanship.<ref name="TH" />

During the proceedings, Howland spotted the three squires who had attacked him standing with their knights, and Lyanna and her brother offered to help him prepare for a jousting match against the knights. Howland refused, and instead knelt on the shore of the [[Gods Eye]] and looked to the [[Isle of Faces]], praying to the [[Old Gods]]. The next morning, the three knights defeated their opponents and earned a place among the champions, only to be met by a mystery knight in the afternoon. Known as the [[Knight of the Laughing Tree]], he wore ill-fitting armor cobbled together from different suits and held a shield painted with a laughing [[heart tree]], the carved white [[weirwood]] of the Old Gods.<ref name="TH" />

The three knights all fell before him, and the common folk cheered him, as the knights were not well-liked. At the Knight of the Laughing Tree's behest, the knights chastised their squires for attacking Howland, and were thus allowed to keep their horses and armor. Aerys was infuriated, and suspected a traitor, possibly Jaime, whom he had already sent to the Red Keep. Declaring the Knight of the Laughing Tree his enemy, Aerys ordered Robert to unmask him. The following morning, however, he was nowhere to be found, and his shield hanging from a tree was all that was ever found.<ref name="TH" />

During the tourney, [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] [[Gerold Hightower]] broke three lances against Ser [[Oswell Whent]] and fought with great distinction in the mêlée, while Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] defeated everyone in the jousts except Rhaegar.<ref>"[[Two Swords]]"</ref> Upon unhorsing Barristan, Rhaegar won the joust, rode past his wife Elia, and crowned Lyanna - who was betrothed to Robert - his queen of love and beauty, leaving the crowd silent and shocked as he lay a crown of blue winter roses in her lap.<ref>"[[Robert's Rebellion - Barristan Selmy]]"</ref>

===Aftermath===
Some time after the tourney, Rhaegar supposedly [[Abduction of Lyanna Stark|abducted]] Lyanna, leading to her brother Brandon riding to [[King's Landing]] and demanding justice from Aerys. However, Aerys responded by imprisoning him and sending for his father, Lord Rickard. While Rickard beckoned for the release of his son, Aerys had both of them cruelly [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|executed]] and ordered Lord [[Jon Arryn]] to hand over Eddard and Robert. Instead, Lords Arryn, Stark, and Baratheon rose up in rebellion,<ref>"[[Mad King Aerys - House Baratheon]]"</ref><ref>"[[Mad King Aerys - House Stark]]"</ref> leading to the deaths of Aerys and Rhaegar and the overthrowing of [[House Targaryen]] in what became known as Robert's Rebellion.<ref>"[[The Sack of King's Landing - House Targaryen]]"</ref><ref>"[[The Sack of King's Landing - House Lannister]]"</ref>

Unbeknownst to most, however, Lyanna had not been abducted. Rather, she had eloped with Rhaegar, and married him in a secret ceremony in [[Dorne]]. Together, they had a son who would become known as [[Jon Snow]].<ref>"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and supplementary books, the story of the Great Tourney at Harrenhal is the same.

The tourney was announced by Lord Walter after being visited by his brother, Ser Oswell. The rewards offered were three times as large as those offered by [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] during the tourney at [[Lannisport]], honoring the birth of [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]]. The tourney was also an opportunity for Lord Whent to show off his large castle and fine sons. It took place over ten days, the competition lasting seven days, and with five days allotted to the joust. There was a seven-sided mêlée in the ancient style, in which Robert unhorsed many opponents. Additionally, there was an archery contest, an axe-throwing contest, a horse race, a tourney of singers and a mummer show. At the beginning of the tourney, Lord Whent's beautiful daughter was the queen of love and beauty, her honor being defended by her brothers and her uncle, Ser Oswell, but all were defeated.

While most believe that [[House Whent]] hosted the tourney to display their wealth and splendor, some believe that the Whents were not wealthy enough to host such a massive event, and would have required a "shadow host". Maester [[Yandel]] believes this host would have been Rhaegar, and Aerys only attended the tourney after [[Varys]] had warned him that Rhaegar would use the event as pretext to gather the lords of Westeros and call for an informal Great Council that would unseat his father. The [[Master of Coin]], [[Qarlton Chelsted]], had unsuccessfully suggested that Aerys forbid the tourney, and when Rhaegar won, he and Lord Symond Staunton stoked the king's suspicions by claiming that Rhaegar had hosted the whole event solely to win the favor of the [[smallfolk]] and remind the lords that he was the true heir to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]].
