'''Desertion'''{{Ref|GOT107}} takes place when a man abandons his post, particularly in times of war. It is a serious crime in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]; deserters are considered [[outlaw]]s and thus are [[Execution|marked for death]].

Within the ranks of the [[Night's Watch]], desertion is considered a form of [[oathbreaking]]. Deserters are not only hunted down by sworn brothers of the Night's Watch but also by [[Lordship|lords]] should a deserter enter his lands.

==Instances of desertion==
*Ser {[[Harrold Westerling]]}, [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]], deserted the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] during the [[Green Council]]'s [[Coup in King's Landing|coup]] at the beginning of the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD109}} His whereabouts in the following weeks are unknown.
*{[[Mance Rayder]]}, a [[ranger]] who deserted his post at the Night's Watch.
*{[[Will]]}, a ranger of the Night's Watch, who fled south after witnessing [[White Walkers]] kill his sworn brothers [[Gared]] and [[Waymar Royce]]. Captured by men of [[House Stark]] and executed by Lord [[Eddard Stark]], [[Warden of the North]].
*{[[Stiv]]} and {[[Wallen]]}, Night's Watch deserters who joined the [[Free Folk]], and later fled south with [[Osha]] in fear of White Walkers. Killed by [[Theon Greyjoy]] and [[Robb Stark]] respectively.
*[[Jon Snow]] briefly deserts the Night's Watch upon learning of his father's [[Execution of Eddard Stark|execution]], intending to join his brother [[Robb Stark]]'s army. He is convinced to turn back by [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]], [[Eddison Tollett|Edd]], and [[Grenn]]. [[Jeor Mormont]] pardons the indiscretion, remarking that if he executed every man who contemplated deserting, they would have no men left.
*[[Sandor Clegane]] dismisses several members of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] as deserters from [[House Baratheon]] and House Stark. He is not entirely accurate, as the Brotherhood is initially formed by survivors of the [[Battle at the Mummer's Ford]], in which a host including Baratheon and Stark men clashed with Ser [[Gregor Clegane]].
**Sandor Clegane himself deserted his position in the [[Kingsguard]] during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].
*{[[Rast]]}, {[[Karl Tanner]]}, and several other black brothers desert the Watch and [[Mutiny at Craster's Keep|mutiny]] against Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]] while taking refuge at the [[Craster's Keep|homestead]] of the [[Free Folk|wildling]] [[Craster]]. All were slain during the [[Raid on Craster's Keep]].
*[[Jaime Lannister]] deserted Cersei following the [[Dragonpit Summit]], after Cersei revealed she intended to betray her 'new' allies against the White Walkers, in order to rule the Seven Kingdoms. It should also be noted that Euron Greyjoy pretended to desert her, but was in-fact sailing to Essos in order to bring the Golden Company to Westeros.
