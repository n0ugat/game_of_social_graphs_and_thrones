'''Bronn's house''' is a newly formed [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]]. It rules over the [[Reach]], a vast, fertile, and heavily-populated region of southwestern Westeros, from their castle-seat of [[Highgarden]] as [[Lord Paramount of the Reach|Lords Paramount of the Reach]] after taking control of the region from [[House Tyrell]], following their extinction as a result of the [[destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]] and the [[Sack of Highgarden]].

The house was founded by [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Bronn|Bronn of the Blackwater]] and raised to power as fulfillment of a debt owed by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] of [[House Lannister]], the [[Hand of the King]] to the first elected [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]], [[Bran Stark|Bran I the Broken]]. The sigil of the house is a flaming arrow, symbolizing Bronn's role during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]]. The official name and words of the house are unknown.

==History==
===Background===
[[File:LordBronn.png|thumb|Lord Bronn, the founder of the house.]]
[[Bronn]] was a sellsword who first encountered [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]], when the latter was arrested by [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]] just prior to the [[War of the Five Kings]].<ref>"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref> Bronn was among the men who traveled with Catelyn as she brought him to her sister, [[Lysa Arryn]] for a trial,<ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref> and Bronn fought and won in a [[trial by combat]] for Tyrion.<ref>"[[A Golden Crown]]"</ref> Bronn continued to travel with and work for [[House Lannister]], guarding Tyrion in [[King's Landing]] and fighting for him at the [[battle on the Green Fork]] and the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].<ref>"[[Baelor]]"</ref><ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref> As a result for his heroism at the Battle of the Blackwater, Bronn was knighted as [[Knighthood|Ser]] Bronn of the Blackwater.<ref>"[[Valar Dohaeris]]"</ref>

Bronn was pledged to wed to Lady [[Lollys Stokeworth]] by [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], in order to deny Tyrion of any potential champions in his [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial]] for the [[Purple Wedding]],<ref>"[[Mockingbird]]"</ref> but the arrangement was later broken by [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] in order to enlist Bronn's aid. Bronn accompanied Jaime to [[Dorne]] in an attempt to rescue [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]],<ref>"[[The House of Black and White]]"</ref> served Jaime at the [[second siege of Riverrun]], and fought at the [[Battle of the Goldroad]].<ref>"[[The Spoils of War]]"</ref> Bronn sought a castle and a noble lady as a wife, which Jaime promised him after stripping him of his chance of acquiring the rule of [[Castle Stokeworth]].<ref>"[[The Broken Man]]"</ref>

After Jaime abandoned his sister, Cersei tasked Bronn with murdering her two brothers for committing treason,<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref> promising to give Bronn [[Riverrun]], but Bronn instead negotiated with the Lannister brothers at [[Winterfell]] after the [[Great War]] ended since he thought that Daenerys had a good chance of winning, threatening to kill them if they didn't follow up on their debts owed to him. Tyrion promised to make Bronn [[Lord of Highgarden]] and [[Lord Paramount of the Reach|Lord]] of the [[Reach]] if he spared them and they won the [[Last War]], to which Bronn agreed.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Bronn's [[noble house]] is formally founded when Bronn is raised as the [[Lord of Highgarden]] and [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]], thus fulfilling the promises made to him by the Lannisters.<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==Relationships==
===Members===
*Lord [[Bronn]], [[Knighthood|knight]] of the [[Blackwater Bay|Blackwater]], [[Lord of Highgarden]], [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]], and [[Master of Coin]] as part of the [[Small Council]] of [[Tyrion Lannister]] under [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Bran Stark|Bran I the Broken]].
**His unnamed younger brother, whose status (both vital and noble) is uncertain.

==Behind the scenes==
The name of Bronn's newly founded house was never revealed in the TV series or in accompanying material. Since he has not founded his own house in the novels the name of his house is thus unknown. In the aftermath of "[[The Iron Throne]]" many viewers assumed that his new house was named '''House Blackwater''' after Bronn's previous style (''Ser Bronn of the Blackwater'') and the name even appeared in articles of publications such as ''Screen Rant''<ref>[https://screenrant.com/game-of-thrones-great-houses-wealth-worth-ranked-poorest-to-richest/ Screen Rant]</ref> and ''Film Daily'',<ref>[https://filmdaily.co/obsessions/iron-throne-game-of-thrones-finale/ Film Daily]</ref> though it is merely fan speculation.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Bronn has not founded his own house. In fact, Bronn's story in the [[Game of Thrones|TV series]] has taken a major deviation from his story in the books. Bronn is married to [[Lollys Stokeworth]] in the books, and thus is a member of [[House Stokeworth]]. Ironically, due to Cersei's attempts to dispose of him, he has risen to become Lord Stokeworth.

House Stokeworth is one of the [[noble house]]s of the [[Crownlands]] sworn directly to the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]], so Bronn, while elevated to nobility, is far less powerful, certainly not [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]]. [[House Tyrell]] still rules the Reach, but there are still two forthcoming novels, so it is unknown what their ultimate fate is. However, several noble houses of the Reach, such as the Florents, Rowans, Cranes, Redwynes, Fossoways, or Tarlys boast a claim to Highgarden through their ancient ties to [[House Gardener]].

In the books, Bronn uses a personal sigil to represent himself, which could become his house sigil if he were to found his own house: a green, flaming chain on a smoking grey field, in commemoration of his role in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].
