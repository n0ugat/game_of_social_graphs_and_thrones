{{Quote|When Aegon the Conqueror was earning his name, House Hightower traded its loyalty to the Gardeners for his confirmation of their rights, welcoming him with open arms and open... gates.|[[Qyburn]]|Oldtown (short)}}
Lord '''Manfred Hightower'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the head of [[House Hightower]] during [[Aegon's Conquest]].

==Biography==
When [[Aegon I Targaryen]] conquered [[Westeros]], Manfred decided to submit to him and abandon [[House Gardener]] in exchange for confirmation of his rights as [[Lord of Oldtown]]. When Aegon marched on [[Oldtown]], the gates were opened to him. It is generally believed that this was done to spare Oldtown from destruction by his [[dragon]]s.{{Ref|H&L612}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Manfred Hightower was a cautious and godly man. The [[High Septon (Aegon's Conquest)|High Septon]] submitted to [[Aegon I Targaryen]] during [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]] of [[Westeros]] and Manfred followed his example due to his pious nature. Once Aegon reached [[Oldtown]], Manfred offered his new king his youngest daughter's hand in [[marriage]], but Aegon refused so as not to offend his [[King|queens]] [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]]. Manfred died during the [[First Dornish War]] and was succeeded by his son, Ser Addam Hightower.
