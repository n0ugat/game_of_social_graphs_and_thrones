The '''assassination''' of [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys Targaryen]], first-born son and heir to King [[Aegon II Targaryen]], occurred in [[132 AC]]{{Dateref|House of the Dragon: Season 2}} at the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. The act was carried out by hired assassins, [[Blood]] and [[Cheese]], under the orders of [[Daemon Targaryen]] as retribution for the death of Queen [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]'s second son, [[Lucerys Velaryon]].

==History==
===Prelude===
At the start of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], Queen [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] sent her son Prince [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]] to [[Storm's End]] to gain the backing of Lord [[Borros Baratheon]]. However, Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] had already arrived at Storm's End to secure a marriage alliance with [[House Baratheon/House of the Dragon|House Baratheon]].{{Ref|HOTD110}} Aemond, whose left eye had been previously maimed by Lucerys in a childhood fight,{{Ref|HOTD107}} demanded Lucerys cut out his eye, but Borros forbade the two princes from fighting in his hall. As Lucerys fled on his [[dragon]] [[Arrax]], Aemond pursued him on [[Vhagar]]. The two [[dragonrider]]s lost control of their dragons, however, as they [[Fight above Shipbreaker Bay|attacked]] each other, culminating in Vhagar killing Arrax, and Lucerys with him.{{Ref|HOTD110}}
[[File:2x1 Daemon Targaryen Still 5.jpg|thumb|Daemon slips into King's Landing.]]
After gathering the remains of her son and his dragon in the [[Stormlands]], Rhaenyra returned to [[Dragonstone]] and declared her desire for Aemond's death. Daemon, having already plotted to kill Aemond and Vhagar with [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]]’s help only to be rebuffed, decided to secretly smuggle himself into [[King's Landing]]. There, he bribed a [[City Watch of King's Landing/House of the Dragon|Gold Cloak]] supporter of his, [[Blood]], to enter the city. The two then met with [[Cheese]], a ratcatcher in the [[Red Keep]] provided to Daemon by [[Mysaria]]. Daemon recruited Cheese to lead Blood into the Red Keep to slay Aemond, but ordered them to kill "a son for a son" if they should not find him.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

===The assassination===
[[File:S2 Blood and Cheese.png|thumb|Blood and Cheese infiltrate through Maegor's tunnels.]]
Cheese led Blood through [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]]'s secret tunnels in the Red Keep. He stopped once they made their way through a significant portion of the castle, as Cheese was afraid to go to the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|royals]]' floor. Blood, however, threatened to kill him and take his portion of the reward for himself if he did not proceed.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

The duo then reached the royal apartments via a room through a secret door. Once there, Blood suggested they set a trap. While Cheese investigated elsewhere, Blood went alone to Aemond's chambers, where he encountered a servant. Blood played off the servant’s suspicions by claiming he was a rat-catcher, but was alarmed when she disappeared shortly after. Fearing the guards will soon be alerted, he searched for Cheese, where he found him holding Queen [[Helaena Targaryen]] hostage. The two realized they were in her chambers, where her children, Prince [[Jaehaerys Targaryen (son of Aegon II)|Jaehaerys]] and Princess [[Jaehaera Targaryen]], were sleeping.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Helaena offered her necklace as a bribe to spare her children; Blood took the necklace, but still demanded that a son must die. Unable to tell which of the children was Jaehaerys, they two forced Helaena to point him out. When she reluctantly did so, Cheese released her as Blood placed his hand over Jaehaerys's mouth and murdered him. Together with Cheese, the two proceeded to remove Jaehaerys’s head, as Daemon promised to pay them the remainder of their bribe only if he received the son's head.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

Helaena, horrified at what was happening to her son, flees the room with Jaehaera to the safety of her mother's chambers, where she happens upon Queen [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] making love to Ser [[Criston Cole]]. Helaena, traumatized, falls to the floor with her daughter, muttering to Alicent that her boy was dead.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

===Aftermath===
Once Blood and Cheese removed Jaehaerys's head, the duo discretely fled the Red Keep undetected into King's Landing. While Cheese remained in the city presumably incognito, Blood decided to flee King's Landing with the Prince's head in tow to escape the impending justice for his crime and collect his payment from Daemon. Meanwhile, back in the Red Keep, the Green royal family and [[Green Council|Council]] are informed of the tragedy. The Kingsguard and the Red Keep garrison begin sweeping the castle for the assailants, whilst rounding up the castle's staff for interrogation. Simultaneously, the City Watch was also placed on high alert, ordered to seal the city and begin searching for the assassins as well.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Shortly after, an emergency Green Council meeting was called to determine how the incident had occurred. [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]], furious at the council's complacency during the incident and supposed ignorance of Jaehaerys's murderer, angrily declares that Rhaenyra is to blame. At that time, Lord [[Larys Strong]] arrives, informing the council that Blood had been detained at the Gate of the Gods, is a Gold Cloak, and possessed the Prince's head in a sack. Aegon immediately declares his intent to execute Blood himself, but Lord [[Jasper Wylde]] urges restraint, suggesting instead to interrogate him first to ascertain who ordered Jaehaerys's murder and anyone else involved. Otto adds that the incident, as horrendous as it is, may serve to help the [[Greens]]' cause. He proceeds to suggest not only sending out [[raven]]s to noble houses across the [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]], implicating Rhaenyra in Jaehaerys's death, but also holding a funeral for the late Prince to gain the sympathy of the [[smallfolk]] in King's Landing. Aegon initially rejects his grandfather's suggestion, refusing to turn his son's death into a spectacle. His mother, Alicent, eventually convinces him, however, that this is the right course of action, with Aegon approving the funeral so long as he himself does not have to participate in it.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Jaehaerys's head is recovered and reattached to his body by the [[Silent Sisters]] as they prepare his body for his funeral. On the day of the funeral, the procession departs the Red Keep for the [[Dragonpit]], followed behind by Jaehaerys's mother and grandmother, Helaena and Alicent. At the same time, an announcer following the procession declares to the assembled masses that Rhaneyra was responsible for Jaehaerys's death. As Otto intended, the funeral procession gains the sympathy of the smallfolk of the capital, who shower the Queen and Dowager Queen with condolences as they make their way through King's Landing. Concurrently, Larys arrives at Blood's cell to begin his interrogation. Blood hastily confesses that Daemon had hired him and Cheese to do the deed but admits he does not know Cheese's identity, only that he was a ratcatcher. Shortly after, Aegon arrives in Blood's cell and proceeds to execute him with a mace.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Upon learning the information Blood provided, Aegon orders for all the ratcatchers in the employ of the Red Keep to be summarily executed and their bodies hanged from the castle's ramparts, Cheese amongst them. The smallfolk and the ratcatchers' respective families are horrified at the sight of this brutal act, mourning for the loss of their sons, brothers, and husbands. When Otto learns of this, he confronts Aegon, lambasting him that his actions have canceled all the sympathy the Greens gained from Jaehaerys's funeral, replaced now by the scorn and hatred of the ratcatchers' families and countless others. Aegon retorts he intends to act militarily, not diplomatically, mentioning Criston's plan of sending Ser [[Arryk Cargyll]] to Dragonstone on a [[Duel on Dragonstone|mission to assassinate Rhaenyra]]. Exasperated at this ill-conceived mission, Otto insults Aegon, reminding him of his father's virtues and his callous disregard for them. He proceeds to admit that [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] never intended for Aegon to be king and proceeds to leave. Aegon promptly dismisses Otto as [[Hand of the King|Hand]] for this statement, appointing Ser Criston as his replacement.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

When news of Jaehaerys's death and his funeral reaches Dragonstone, Rhaenyra is informed by Maester [[Gerardys]] that she is being blamed for it and that ravens with that message have been sent throughout the realm. Rhaenyra is horrified and orders for ravens of their own to be sent out denying the allegations, but Gerardys admits these messages may not be received in good faith. Lord [[Bartimos Celtigar]] adds that the [[Blacks]] position has been immeasurably damaged, with Ser [[Alfred Broome]] going so far as to state that Rhaenya, in her grief over Lucerys's death, may have acted in haste, a suggestion she adamantly refutes. After the meeting of the [[Black Council]], Rhaenyra confronts Daemon over Jaehaerys's assassination. He admits his responsibililty in the act, leading to a heated argument over his loyalty to her and her subsequent loss of trust in him.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

The assassination of Jaehaerys Targaryen proved to be a major diplomatic blunder for the Blacks, with the fallout of the act reverberating across the Seven Kingdoms. At a time in the Dance where the Blacks were still at a disadvantage to the Greens in terms of support, it is implied from Lord Bartimos statement that the Blacks reputation and legitimacy were heavily damaged. Furthermore, Jaehaerys's death served as being the point of no return for a potential peaceful resolution to the Dance, as Otto Hightower's replacement as Hand with Criston Cole ensured that the Greens would match the Blacks stance on a military resolution to the conflict.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the murder of Prince Jaehaerys by Blood and Cheese is described somewhat differently. Daemon hired the two to kill one of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]]'s sons, but did not personally meet them, but via a middleperson.

In the books, Aegon II and Helaena already had two sons by this point in the story, Jaehaerys and [[Maelor Targaryen]], along with their daughter Jaehaera. Helaena returned to her chambers to find her mother gagged and her three children held hostage by Blood and Cheese. The two forced her to choose a son to sacrifice, and she reluctantly chose the younger Maelor. However, they only mocked Maelor before killing Jaehaerys anyway, and fled with his head while leaving the rest unharmed. As a result, Helaena fell into a deep depression and madness.

Two days later, Blood was caught. Under torture, he gave up a description of the middleperson who hired them, which matched Mysaria (but did not mention Daemon's name), and died after thirteen days of torment. No trace of Cheese or Mysaria was ever found. At Aegon II's command, all the ratcatchers in the city were hanged.
