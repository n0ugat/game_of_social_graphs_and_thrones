This ''' White Walker''' is one of the lieutenants of the [[Night King]] and one of the commanders of the growing [[wight]] army marching on [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
The White Walker accompanied his master, the [[Night King]], when their [[Wight|Army of the Dead]] surrounded [[Jon Snow]], [[Tormund]], [[Jorah Mormont]], [[Sandor Clegane]], [[Beric Dondarrion]] and [[Thoros]], who had captured a [[Captured wight|wight]] and were attempting to bring it south of the [[Wall]]. [[Daenerys Targaryen]] arrived with her [[dragon]]s, and the lieutenant provided the Night King with a throwing spear which he used to kill [[Viserion]]. The White Walker handed him another spear to kill [[Drogon]], but the Night King missed. He then departed with the rest of the White Walkers and the wights once their enemies had escaped.{{Ref|GOT706}}
