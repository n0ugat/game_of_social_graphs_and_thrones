'''House Baratheon'''{{Ref|GOT101}} of [[Storm's End]] is a [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]] that traditionally rules the [[Stormlands]] on the eastern coast of Westeros, aptly named for its frequent storms.

==History==
House Baratheon was founded by [[Orys Baratheon]], a general in the army of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon I Targaryen]], the founder of the [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|Targaryen dynasty]] who [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered]] the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Orys Baratheon was also rumored to be Aegon's [[bastard]] half-brother. He defeated [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]], the last of the [[Storm King]]s, and captured his castle of [[Storm's End]]. For his accomplishments, Orys was made [[Lord of Storm's End]] and founded House Baratheon. Orys took the sigil and words of the defeated [[House Durrandon]] as his own, cementing his [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands|rule]] over the [[Stormlands]] by marrying [[Argella Baratheon|Argella Durrandon]], the daughter of the fallen Argilac.

Lord Boremund hosts Princess Rhaenyra at [[Storm's End]] on her tour of the realm to find a suitor.{{Ref|HOTD104}}

At the [[Black Council]], Rhaenyra Targaryen expects to sway Lord Borros to the [[Blacks]] due to their blood ties through Rhaenys Targaryen, sending her son [[Lucerys Velaryon]] to Storm's End. Lucerys fails in his mission as Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] arrives earlier and promises to wed [[Floris Baratheon]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}
