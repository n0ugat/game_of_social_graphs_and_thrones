==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Joffrey Lonmouth is a knight of House Lonmouth, and the favorite companion of Laenor Velaryon, of whom he was rumored to be a lover. He is known as the Knight of Kisses on account of the heraldry of his house: Quartered of six: red lips strewn on a yellow field, yellow skulls strewn on a black field.

Joffrey competed in a tournament during the wedding celebrations of Laenor and Rhaenyra. He rode as Laenor's champion, while [[Harwin Strong]] rode as Rhaenyra's. Ser Criston Cole, furious that Rhaenyra bestowed her garter on Ser Harwin instead of him, took it out on the other competitors, especially Joffrey: he mercilessly used his morningstar on Joffrey, cracking his helm and leaving him senseless. According to Mushroom, Laenor did not leave Joffrey's bedside, and wept bitterly when he died six days afterwards.
