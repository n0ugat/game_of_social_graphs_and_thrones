Ser '''Vaemond Velaryon''' was a [[knight]] of [[House Velaryon]]. He was the younger brother of [[Corlys Velaryon]] and a commander in the [[Velaryon fleet|Velaryon navy]].<ref>[https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-releases-first-official-teaser-house-dragon HBO Releases First Official Teaser For HOUSE OF THE DRAGON]</ref>

==Biography==
===Background===
Vaemond is the younger brother of Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]], the [[Lord of the Tides]] and [[Master of Driftmark]]. He serves his brother and his house as a commander in the [[Velaryon fleet]]. Vaemond is proud of the ancient lineage of [[House Velaryon]] and its [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] heritage.{{Guideref|Vaemond Velaryon}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon:'' Season 1]]===
[[File:SOHN Vaemond and Corlys.jpg|left|thumb|Infighting between brothers. ]]
[[File:VaemondVelaryonSoHN.PNG|left|thumb|Charging into battle against the Triarchy.]]
Vaemond fights in the [[War for the Stepstones]]. Three years into the drawn-out conflict, Vaemond petitions King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] for reinforcements, unbeknownst to the other commanders. Although he expresses misgivings concerning the plan to use [[Daemon Targaryen]] as bait during the [[siege of Bloodstone]] to the extent that his nephew [[Laenor Velaryon]] dubs him the "master of complaints," Vaemond partakes in the ultimately successful plan.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

About a year after the victory in the Stepstones, Vaemond is present alongside the rest of his family at the wedding between Laenor Velaryon and [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. He is seated at the great table alongside his family members.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Vaemond leads [[Laena Velaryon]]'s funeral procession on [[Driftmark]] in [[High Valyrian]]. During his eulogy, Vaemond includes several pointed remarks about Velaryon blood remaining pure while glancing at the supposed children of Rhaenyra and Laenor, [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] and [[Lucerys Velaryon]], who look nothing like Laenor or other Velaryons. Vaemond's choice to bring up the children's questionable paternity during the eulogy elicits laughter from Laena's widower Daemon.{{Ref|HOTD107}}
[[File:TLOTT Vaemond 3.png|thumb|Ser Vaemond plots to take Driftmark.]]
After Corlys is injured fighting in the Stepstones, Vaemond intensifies his efforts to keep Lucerys Velaryon from inheriting Driftmark. After Vaemond is reminded by [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]] that Corlys named Lucerys his heir, Vaemond travels to King's Landing to make his case before the king that he should instead be named heir. Upon arrival to the [[Red Keep]], Vaemond speaks with [[Otto Hightower|Otto]] and [[Alicent Hightower]], who—due to their animosity towards Rhaenyra—support his claim.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

[[File:Vaemond beheaded.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vaemond is decapitated by Prince Daemon.]]
During an audience in the [[throne room]], with Otto Hightower sitting on the [[Iron Throne]] as [[Hand of the King]] owing to [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys]] being bedridden, Vaemond makes the case that he is a true Velaryon and the closest kin of Corlys whereas Rhaenyra's sons are not. Before Rhaenyra has time to make her own case, Viserys enters the throne room to the surprise of everyone present and takes charge of the proceedings. Realizing that he has no chance of convincing the king to disinherit his own grandchildren, Vaemond becomes irate and aggressive, shouting that Rhaenyra's children are [[bastard]]s and calling Rhaenyra herself a "whore."{{Ref|HOTD108}} Vaemond's slander of the royal family is deemed to be treason{{Guideref|Vaemond Velaryon}} and Viserys threatens to remove Vaemond's tongue himself. Before he is able to, Daemon decapitates him from behind using [[Dark Sister]]. A group of [[Silent Sisters]] later prepare Vaemond's body for transportation back to Driftmark, while Rhaenys watches.{{Ref|HOTD108}}

==Behind the scenes==
On October 5, 2021, [[HBO]] announced that [[Wil Johnson]] had been cast in the role of Vaemond Velaryon for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. His character description reads as follows:

:''"Younger brother to Coryls Velaryon and commander in the Velaryon navy."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}[[File:Vaemond Sword Pommel.png|thumb]]

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Vaemond is not Corlys's brother but his nephew, the son of his unnamed younger brother. While names do repeat in dynasties, the TV version may have been condensed into simply being his younger brother instead of his nephew. There are ''numerous'' Velaryon cousins from younger branches of the family, just as in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels there were numerous minor Lannister cousins, resulting in condensations in the TV series.

When Corlys suddenly fell ill with a severe fever, Vaemond immediately pressed his claim as heir to Driftmark. He openly claimed that Rhaenyra's children by Laenor are bastards, prompting Rhaenyra to send Daemon to execute him for treason. Daemon beheaded him, and his carcass was fed to [[Syrax]]. Five of his cousins, all merged into Vaemond's character in the TV series, followed in his footsteps, causing Viserys to have their tongues removed. For this, history remembers them as the "silent five."
