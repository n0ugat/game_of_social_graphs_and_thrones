''Khal'' '''Savo''' was a [[Dothraki]] ''[[khal]]'' who was married to the current [[High Priestess (Oathbreaker)|High Priestess]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[Daenerys Targaryen]] is captured and returned to [[Vaes Dothrak]] as she is the widow of ''Khal'' [[Drogo]] and must join the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]'', the revered widows of dead ''[[khal]]s''. Daenerys tries to get the [[High Priestess (Oathbreaker)|High Priestess]] to respect her by saying that she was the ''[[Khaleesi]]'' of the Great Khal - as Drogo was the strongest ''khal'' of his generation. The elderly High Priestess sympathetically dismisses this by saying that ''she'' was once married to the "Great Khal" of her generation, ''Khal'' Savo, and she thought she would ride by his side as he conquered the world - she was young once too and had such dreams, but life didn't turn out that way for her either.{{Ref|GOT603}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, no mention has been made of a "''Khal'' Savo". It is unknown if he will be mentioned in a future novel.
