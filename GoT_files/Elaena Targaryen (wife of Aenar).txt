{{Quote|Elaena Targaryen, it must be said, was a dour and gloomy woman.|The author of a book|Episode 1 (House of the Dragon: The House That Dragons Built)}}
Lady '''Elaena Targaryen'''{{Ref|THTDB201}} was a wife of Lord [[Aenar Targaryen]] and mother of [[Daenys Targaryen|Daenys the Dreamer]].

==Biography==
Elaena was the first person Daenys told of her [[Dragon dream|dream]] of the [[Doom of Valyria]]. The fall of her family from dominance when Aenar moved them to [[Dragonstone]] vexed and angered Elaena. She began to spend money as if she were infinitely rich, and she would blame her troubles on her husband.{{Ref|THTDB201}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aenar Targaryen had several wives, none of whom are named. Daenys, however, named her eldest daughter Elaena.
