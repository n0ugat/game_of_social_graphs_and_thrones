'''Septas'''{{Ref|GOT102}} are the female clergy of the [[Faith of the Seven]]. They are women sworn to celibacy, sometimes serving noble houses as governesses and tutors to the daughters of lords, teaching them in matters of etiquette and history and activities such as sewing. In contrast, male clergy are known as [[septon]]s.

Septas dress in humble clothing. This normally comprises a subdued shade with their hair concealed.
