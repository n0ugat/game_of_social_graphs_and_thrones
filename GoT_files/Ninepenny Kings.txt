{{Quote|...the War of the Ninepenny Kings, a cheap name for a cheap cause...|[[Petyr Baelish]]|House Baelish (short)}}
The '''Ninepenny Kings'''{{Ref|H&L402}} were the instigators of the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. Among them was [[Maelys Blackfyre]], the fifth and last of the [[House Blackfyre|Blackfyre Pretenders]].{{Ref|H&L508}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Ninepenny Kings (calling themselves the Band of Nine) were an alliance of outlaws, exiles, pirates, and sellsword captains founded in 258 AC beneath the Tree of Crowns in the [[Disputed Lands]]. These included the pirate queen known as the Old Mother, the [[Lys]]ene pirate Samarro Saan, the exiled [[Summer Isles|Summer Islander]] [[prince]] Xhobar Qhoqua, the sellsword captain Liomond Lashare, a [[Westeros]]i sellsword captain named Spotted Tom the Butcher, the exiled [[Knighthood|knight]] Ser Derrick Fossoway, Captain Nine Eyes of the Jolly Fellows, the [[Tyrosh]]i merchant prince Alequo Adarys, and Maelys Blackfyre, captain-general of the [[Golden Company]] and a pretender to the [[Iron Throne]].

In an early draft of ''A Feast for Crows'', there are a few differences and extra details on the Band of Nine:

*Nine Eyes is named "Rogo the Red Jester".
*Alequo Adarys is called "Goldentongue," whereas he is called "Silvertongue" in the final version.
*Spotted Tom's free company is specified as the Maiden's Men.
*Liomond Lashare was not a member of the Band of Nine, but was the only man among ten to refuse the pact and vowed to defeat the other nine in turn. The others present then slew him and buried him beneath the Tree of Crowns. In this version, his place is filled by a [[Meereen]]ese nobleman named Corzo zo Merreq.
