In 73 AC, she joined the clergy of the [[Faith of the Seven]] as a novice, eventually becoming a [[septa]]. She had a talent for healing, and often nursed sick children.

In 90 and 94 AC, Maegelle helped to reconcile the king and queen during both of their estrangements, known respectively as the First and Second Quarrels.
