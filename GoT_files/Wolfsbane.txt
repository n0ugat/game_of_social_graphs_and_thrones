'''Wolfsbane'''{{Ref|GOT207}} is a lethal [[poison]] obtained from a plant of the same name. Darts dipped in it may kill a grown man quickly.

==History==
[[File:Amory assassinated.jpg|thumb|Amory Lorch is assassinated with a wolfsbane dart.]]

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Jaqen H'ghar]] murders Ser [[Amory Lorch]] using a poisonous dart dipped in wolfsbane.<ref>"[[The Old Gods and the New]]"</ref> [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] identifies the poison from the smell of the dart.<ref>"[[A Man Without Honor]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, wolfsbane is mentioned as a type of poison, but is never employed in the narrative. Amory Lorch's death is not caused by it, or by any other poison.

Wolfsbane is actually a poison in real-life, made from the ''Aconitum'' plant genus, which contains 250 individual species - all collectively known as "wolf's bane".
