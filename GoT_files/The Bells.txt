==Synopsis==
===On Dragonstone===
[[Varys]] is writing letters pertaining to the truth about [[Jon Snow]]'s [[House Targaryen|heritage]] when [[Martha|one]] of his [[Little birds|spies]] walks in and tells Varys that [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] has not eaten anything in days. Varys responds they'll try again at supper and Martha tells Varys that Daenerys's [[Unsullied|soldiers]] are constantly on alert. Varys assures her that the higher the risk, the greater the reward. She is sent back to the kitchen as Varys gets word of the arrival of Jon and his [[Northmen|men]].

When Jon arrives, he briefs Varys on the Northern army's progress. Jon asks how Daenerys is doing, with Varys responding that Daenerys is refusing to eat or leave her chambers. Jon replies that Daenerys shouldn't be alone and Varys admires that Jon is worried for her. When Jon asks Varys if he isn't worried as well, Varys says he's worried for them all and speaks of Daenerys's mental [[Targaryen madness|state]], "They say that when a [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] is born, the [[Seven|gods]] flip a coin." Varys says that he knows not what side Daenerys's coin will land on, but that he knows which side Jon's will land on, implying that he wants Jon to take the [[Iron Throne]] over Daenerys. Jon vehemently refuses, to which Varys says that he has advised [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|kings]] and rulers for many years, and knows how Daenerys will end up, given everything he has seen. Jon is still opposed to the idea, saying that Daenerys is his [[King|Queen]] now and forever.

[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] meets with Daenerys in [[Dragonstone]]'s [[Painted Table|war room]], where she has been self-isolated for days. Having become paranoid, she surmises that someone has betrayed her and her [[Hand of the King|Hand]] confirms it. When Daenerys says it was Jon Snow, Tyrion reveals that it was actually Varys and Daenerys confirms that the Master of Whisperers knows the truth about Jon. She tells Tyrion that he told Varys, "You learned from Sansa. And she learned from Jon, though I begged him not to tell her," and thus feels Jon has betrayed her. Tyrion says he needs to be aware of this information so that he and Varys can be prepared for anything Daenerys might face, but Daenerys is suspicious of Sansa's motives for telling Tyrion. The dwarf admits it was a mistake to tell Varys without Daenerys's permission and Sansa told Tyrion because she trusts him. Daenerys responds, "She trusted you to spread secrets that could destroy your own queen. And you did not let her down." Tyrion asks for forgiveness, saying they want the better world she wants and their intentions were good, "Varys as much as anyone. But it doesn't matter now." and Daenerys replies, "No. It doesn't matter now."
[[File:VARYSDEATH805.png|thumb|Varys looks forlornly at his doom.]]
Later that night, Varys is writing more letters when he hears the approach of guards. He immediately burns the letter he is currently writing as [[Grey Worm]] and his [[Unsullied|men]] came into his room, shackles in hand. Seeing this, Varys knows what is about to occur. Without resistance, he is taken to the shores of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], where Daenerys, Jon, and Tyrion are waiting for him. Tyrion tells Varys that it was him who sold his treachery out to Daenerys. Varys understands, and states that he hopes that he is wrong about everything he said about Daenerys. He bids one more farewell to Tyrion before [[Drogon]] burns him at Daenerys's command. Tyrion unhappily looks on while Jon looks at Daenerys in concern.

In their room later, Jon comes to see Daenerys. She asks him what she said would happen if Jon told [[Sansa Stark|his sister]] about her parentage and Jon replies he doesn't want the crown and told Varys as much. Daenerys says Sansa betrayed Jon's trust, "She killed Varys as much as I did. This was a victory for her. Now she knows what happens when people hear the truth about you." Daenerys confides that the people of [[Westeros]] love Jon more than her, that all she has here is fear, not love. Jon tells Daenerys, "I love you," and says she will always be his Queen regardless of how others feel about her. Daenerys asks, "Is that all I am to you? Your queen?" She and Jon start to kiss. However, Jon breaks off the kiss, still unable to get over their blood ties. In response, Daenerys accepts this but solemnly says, "Alright then. Let it be fear."

In the throne room of Dragonstone, Tyrion consults with Daenerys, the latter of whom is now ordering Grey Worm and the [[Unsullied]] to [[Battle of King's Landing|sack]] [[King's Landing]]. Tyrion is strongly against it, saying that the [[Smallfolk|citizens]] of the city are not Daenerys's enemy and are innocent, but Daenerys counters that the slaves in [[Meereen]] turned against their masters and liberated themselves. Tyrion responds that the smallfolk are afraid of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] because she will punish any rebellious acts. In response, Daenerys states they are hostages in a tyrant's grip, and Tyrion begs her not to burn the city, or thousands of children will die. Daenerys counters that Cersei is using mercy as a weakness against them but Cersei is wrong, mercy is their strength - her mercy for the future generations of Westeros, not those in the present.

In a last ditch effort to get through to Daenerys, Tyrion bargains one last time: he will go talk to Cersei and convince her to surrender, saying, "Cersei's followers will abandon her if they know the war is lost. Give them that chance." When he does, he will ring the bells of King's Landing, indicating the full, unconditional surrender of Cersei and her army. Tyrion pleads with her to not attack unless he's done this deed. Daenerys reluctantly agrees. Before Tyrion leaves, she informs her him that [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] was caught by her men trying to get past their lines before warning her Hand that the next time he fails her, it will be his very last.

===In King's Landing===
[[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] and his men are prepping for the [[Battle of King's Landing|siege]] outside [[King's Landing]], when Jon and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] arrive. Tyrion asks Davos if he can smuggle something specific for him. He gets past the [[Unsullied|guards]] surrounding [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]]'s tent and enters to see his brother shackled to a post. Tyrion reveals that he smuggled the key to Jaime's shackles and unchains him, saying that he wants him to be the one to go to [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and convince her to surrender, saying it will be much easier for him than it would be for Tyrion himself. Tyrion has arranged with Davos a boat for Jaime and Cersei to escape to [[Pentos]]. Jaime agrees but argues that Daenerys will kill Tyrion for this, but Tyrion replies he considers his life a fair exchange if it allows Daenerys to take the city without slaughtering thousands. He thanks Jaime for everything he has ever done for him before the two brothers share a tearful goodbye for the last time.

The next morning, the united army of the [[Unsullied]], [[Dothraki]], and [[Northmen]] are waiting outside the walls of King's Landing. Tyrion instructs Jon to call off his men when they hear the bells ringing. Meanwhile, a select few [[Smallfolk|citizens]] of the city have been crowded in the [[Red Keep]] to protect them from the coming invasion. Cersei overlooks the city and sees her plan coming to fruition: she intends to keep a vast swath of innocent smallfolk in the path of the Red Keep, seeing if [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] will truly burn the city and all the inhabitants with it.

In [[Blackwater Bay]], the [[Iron Fleet]] waits in silence, when Daenerys, riding atop [[Drogon]], ambushes them by diving directly out of the sun. The [[Ironborn]] fire their [[scorpion]]s, but are unable to land a hit, for their target is far too fast for them. With his flames, Drogon all but destroys the Iron Fleet, including the ''[[Silence]]'', though [[Euron Greyjoy]] is barely able to escape by jumping into the sea.

As the armies wait at the gates for the bells to ring, Daenerys and Drogon suddenly burst through the gates in a fiery blast, scattering the [[Golden Company]]. [[Grey Worm]] and the united army immediately charge at the gate and take care of what remains of the Golden Company. In the mayhem, Grey Worm impales a fleeing Captain [[Harry Strickland|Strickland]] in the back with his spear, killing him.
[[File:STARKENTOURAGEBE;;S.jpeg|thumb|The Stark army enters King's Landing.]]
As the united army takes to the streets of King's Landing, taking out any and all enemy soldiers in their path, Daenerys and Drogon strafe the city walls, destroying the remaining scorpions. They then make their way to the gates of the innermost part of the city, where [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers are waiting. The two opposing armies come to an intense standstill until Daenerys perches Drogon atop one of the walls. Realizing their chances of winning are dwindling fast, the Lannister soldiers threw down their weapons and surrender. Tyrion and Jon are visibly relieved as the battle is seemingly done and the citizens of the city cry out for the bells to be rung. After a long amount of time passes, the bells are finally rung, signaling what appears to be the end of the sack of the city.

While the bells keep ringing, Daenerys gazes at the Red Keep with a look of pure hatred in her eyes and becomes more and more unstable, eventually succumbing to the infamous Targaryen Madness. Without uttering a single word, Daenerys takes Drogon to the skies, and in a terrifying display of rage, begins to burn the city, incinerating entire buildings and neighborhoods, killing both soldiers and innocent civilians alike. Outside the city, Tyrion is horrified by what he has witnessed.
[[File:GreyWormBOKL.png|thumb|A vengeful Grey Worm battles the surrendered soldiers.]]
Following his queen's footsteps, Grey Worm, filled with vengeance and a lust for blood, takes his spear and throws it at the Lannister Captain, killing him. With that, it becomes the call to arms as the Targaryen, Stark, and Arryn forces begin attacking and killing surrendered forces. In horror, [[Jon Snow|Jon]] orders his own men back and tries to get them to stop fighting. Unfortunately, the Northmen are in no mood to be merciful towards House Lannister, the house who are almost single-handedly responsible for every single atrocity the North has suffered over the years and they join their new allies in the slaughter.

Chaos erupts as the Unsullied, Northmen, and Valemen alike charge into the innermost parts of the city, killing anyone, soldier or civilian, and raping women they come across. A horrified Jon is caught up in the disorder, deflecting attacks and shouting at his men to stop fighting while Davos tries to usher people to safety. An increasingly fearful and alarmed Cersei looks on from the Red Keep in shock as the carnage continues and fire comes down from above. On the ground, Jon finds one of his own men grabbing an innocent woman and intervenes before the soldier could even rape her. Blinded by rage and vengeance, the soldier attacks Jon, who is forced to kill him. Meanwhile, in the air above, Daenerys begins destroying parts of the Red Keep, sending tons of debris falling to the ground below.

Around this time, [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] sneaks around the cliffs on which the Red Keep is situated and encounters Euron, who survived his brush with death. Jaime urges Euron to help him save Cersei, but the Ironborn king points out that the city and Cersei are lost. He and Jaime begin fighting, saying that he will personally deliver Jaime's severed head to Cersei so she can kiss it one last time. Although Euron stabs Jaime multiple times, the latter is able to overpower him and impales him through the stomach with his sword. He walks away, severely injured, as Euron, while smiling, utters: "I'm the man who killed Jaime Lannister.", before dying from his wounds.

Meanwhile, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]] sneak into the Red Keep and reach Maegor's Holdfast, the walls crumbling around them. Sandor urges Arya to go home, arguing that Cersei is as good as dead but Arya insists that she is going to kill [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Before she continues on, Sandor grabs her by the arm and urges her to choose life over vengeance, saying that he himself has been seeking revenge his entire life and tells Arya to be better than someone like him, a living embodiment of the vengeance she is seeking and what it will do to her. When Arya tries to continue onward, Sandor warns her that if she goes with him she'll also die. As he goes to deal with his [[Gregor Clegane|brother]], Arya calls him by his name for the first time, and thanks him before they both go their separate ways.
[[File:Clegane Battle S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Sandor confronts Gregor.]]
Having convinced Cersei that all is lost, [[Qyburn]] evacuates Cersei and her Queensguard from the Red Keep, but they come across Sandor before they reach Maegor's Holdfast. The Hound effortlessly dispatches the [[Kingsguard|Queensguard]] before standing face-to-face with his brother. He taunts [[Gregor Clegane|Gregor]], breaking Cersei and Qyburn's control of him. Cersei orders Gregor to protect her, but the Mountain defies her, wanting to fight his brother. Qyburn repeats the order, prompting [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] to smash his head against a wall, killing Qyburn. Cersei flees as the [[House Clegane|Clegane]] brothers stare each other down. Meanwhile, Arya continues to escape through King's Landing, nearly being trampled by civilians who are trying to escape the wrath of Daenerys and her forces.

Back at the Red Keep, Sandor attacks his brother, which has little effect, until he knocks Gregor's helmet off. Sandor mocks him, provoking Gregor into drawing his sword and, in his fury, begins to madly fight his brother. Sandor proves the better fighter, driving his sword into Gregor's chest, though it does not kill him. After pulling the sword out and discarding most of his armor, Gregor beats down his brother and lifts him up against the wall, putting him in a choke-hold. The Hound tries to free himself by stabbing Gregor several times with a knife, which proves to be ineffective. Just as Gregor is about to gouge out his brother's eyes, Sandor stabs his brother clean in the left eye. Even this does not stop Gregor, who begins pulling the knife from his eye. Knowing that none of his attacks will truly kill his brother, Sandor knows what he must do. Mustering up enough courage to face his fears, he tackles Gregor, shoving them both through the badly damaged wall behind, sending them plummeting hundreds of feet into an inferno below.

In the streets of King's Landing, Davos and Jon are reeling at the carnage and fire surrounding them as caches of [[wildfire]] explode while Daenerys and Drogon continue their burning of the city. Davos and Jon share a look and Jon orders his forces to fall back. He and Davos rush people out of the city as fire rains down upon them from above.
[[File:The Bells.jpeg|thumb|Jaime reunites with his one true love.]]
Cersei herself is alone in the Red Keep when she sees Jaime, bloodied and badly wounded following his fight with Euron. The two of them go deep into the lower chambers of the Red Keep, where Tyrion had told Jaime to go where there would be a boat waiting for them on the beach to take them away from the city. Unfortunately, however, they find their path has been blocked by rubble. A frightened Cersei begins to cry in fear, saying that she does not want to die. Jaime tells her not to look at the crumbling keep, saying, "Look at me, just look at me. Nothing else matters, nothing else matters, only us." Hearing the weakened structure above them caving in, the twins embrace for the last time as the ceiling caves in, crushing them.

Meanwhile, Arya regains consciousness after she was left incapacitated by a concussive blast. She manages to get into a building full of women and children and convinces them to keep moving, lest they perish where they stand. They begin to escape, but most of them, save a [[Nora|mother]] and her young daughter, are killed by the roving Dothraki. The mother collapses and tells Arya to take her daughter to safety. Arya grabs the child and begins to run, but the girl refuses to leave her mother behind and goes to her side just as Daenerys and Drogon swoop down one last time and unleashing another torrent of fire upon the innocent civilians.

Arya awakes later and sees the devastation around her. She is devastated to find that the mother and daughter were burned alive. As she stumbles around the city, Arya sees the dead bodies of many innocent men, women, and children, all at the hands of her cousin's lover. She then spots a white horse among the throes of the dead. She is able to calm and mount the animal and rides out of the city to an uncertain future, leaving the devastation of King's Landing behind her. An unrequited order from the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] has been fulfilled; "Burn them all," coming to life at his daughter's hand as King's Landing burns.

==Behind the scenes==
===General===
* The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of the [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#House Lannister theme|House Lannister theme]] and [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#Cersei's theme|Cersei's theme]]. On the [[Game of Thrones: Season 8 (Music from the HBO Series)|official soundtrack release]] it is titled "For Cersei."
*Three long-standing fan theories are referenced in this episode:
**"Cleganebowl," a final showdown between Sandor and Gregor Clegane;
**"Mad Queen Daenerys", with Daenerys apparently succumbing to the notorious Targaryen madness;
**Daenerys as the "younger, more beautiful queen" prophesized by [[Maggy]], who would cast Cersei down and take all she held dear.
*[[Winterfell]] and [[Last Hearth]] both appear in the [[Opening credits (Game of Thrones)|opening credits]] despite not appearing in the episode while [[Dragonstone]] once again does not appear despite being a major setting for the episode.
*With the deaths of [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor]] and [[Gregor Clegane]], all known members of [[House Clegane]] are dead, rendering the house extinct.
*With [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s deaths, Tyrion has become [[Lord of Casterly Rock]] and head of [[House Lannister]] as the sole remaining offspring of [[Tywin Lannister]]. This is ironic given Tywin's resentment toward Tyrion and refusal to make Tyrion his heir.
*With the death of Euron, [[Yara Greyjoy]]'s rule of the Iron Islands is now uncontested.
*The pale white horse found by Arya at the end of the episode may be a reference to the Book of Revelation from the Christian Bible: Revelation 6:8 refers to a rider of the white or ashen horse being death, and where ever the white horse goes, death follows with it. Arya was affiliated with the [[Many-Faced God]] of Death, and the horse is leaving behind a burning city with thousands dead.
** The exact text reads: "And I looked, and behold, a ashen horse! And its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him."
** An interesting theory, however, an ashen or pale horse is more grey in color.  A white horse has a different meaning in the Book of Revelations: "So I looked and saw a white horse, and its rider had a bow. And he was given a crown, and he rode out to overcome and conquer." Then a later verse states, "And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war…"
*The [[City Watch of King's Landing]] doesn't appear in the episode. A likely reason for this is that Cersei assimilated the City Watch into the Lannister army to replenish their badly-depleted numbers after the Battle of the Goldroad.
*Ironically, the episode in which [[Cersei Lannister]] dies aired on Mother's Day of 2019.
**Similarly, the [[The Children|episode]] in which Cersei's father [[Tywin Lannister]] died aired on Father's Day of 2014.
*Even more ironically, [[Daenerys Targaryen]], mother of dragons went "mad" during [https://www.awarenessdays.com/awareness-days-calendar/maternal-mental-health-month-2019/ maternal mental health month]. This international awareness month will include the finale.
*The destruction of the Red Keep in this episode leaves the fate of prisoners in the Black Cells, like Septa [[Unella]] and [[Ellaria Sand]], uncertain. One can assume they were crushed/suffocated in their cells, as the damage was enough for the basements of the Keep to be crumbling, suggesting the entire structure was compromised.
**The fates of members of the royal court, such as [[Bernadette]] or Ser [[Ilyn Payne]], are also uncertain, but assuming they were in the Red Keep during the battle, they were just as unlikely to have survived as the prisoners in the black cells.
*Two songs can be heard playing simultaneously during the end credits: "The Light of the Seven" and "[[The Rains of Castamere]]." Both were originally odes to Lannister triumphs: "The Light of the Seven" first being played alongside the destruction of Cersei's enemies in "[[The Winds of Winter]]", and the latter being the unofficial anthem of House Lannister, commemorating their destruction of their [[House Reyne|renegade bannermen]]. So it's ironic that they play in an episode that sees two Lannisters killed in a similar manner to the Reynes, and House Lannister seemingly on the brink of extinction.
**"The Rains of Castamere" has been used in this way before to mark moments of strife for House Lannister, including Tyrion's wounding during the Battle of the Blackwater, Joffrey's death ("[[The Lion and the Rose]]"), Tyrion's trial ("[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]"), and Tywin's death ("[[The Children]]").
*Qyburn is the seventh consecutive Hand of the King to be killed: prior to him were [[Qarlton Chelsted]], who was executed at Aerys's order; [[Rossart]] - slain by Jaime; [[Jon Arryn]] - poisoned by [[Lysa Arryn|his wife]]; [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] - executed at Joffrey's order; [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] - shot by Tyrion; [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] - incinerated when Cersei blew up the Great Sept of Baelor.
*The fight between Gregor and Sandor Clegane (known commonly as "Cleganebowl") was choreographed by [[Vladimír Furdík]] who also portrayed the [[Night King]] in Seasons 6-8.

===Callbacks===
*The title of the episode recalls what Varys said to Tyrion shortly before the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] in "[[Blackwater]]": ‘’I’ve always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king. A city under siege.’’ Strangely enough, in the same episode, Davos states that he has never known ringing bells to mean surrender of a city, which is precisely what they are supposed to mean in Tyrion's plan.
*[[Varys]] paraphrases his belief that "power resides where men believe it resides," something he first talked about in "[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]."
*[[Varys]]'s last words to Tyrion are "Goodbye, old friend", which echoes how he greeted him when they were reunited in Meereen in "[[Mother's Mercy]]", saying "Hello, old friend".
*Varys is seen writing a letter addressed to an unknown recipient informing them of Jon Snow's true parentage and that he is the rightful heir to the Iron Throne. This is a reversal on what [[Eddard Stark]] did in "[[You Win or You Die]]", when he wrote a letter to [[Stannis Baratheon]] informing him that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] was not truly [[Robert Baratheon|Robert's]] son and had no claim to the throne.
*Varys is burnt alive by Daenerys for his treason, just as Daenerys threatened him in "[[Stormborn]]". Moreover, just like [[Melisandre]] prophesised in "[[The Queen's Justice]]", Varys does indeed die in Westeros, far from his native land.
*Tyrion once again shows his [[Low Valyrian|Valyrian]] leaves much to be desired, mixing up words like he did in [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]]'s "[[Mother's Mercy]]" and [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]]'s "[[The Red Woman]]" and "[[Book of the Stranger]]."
*Jaime recalls that Cersei once called him "the stupidest Lannister", which she did in "[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]".
*[[Drogon]]'s shadow is seen flying over King's Landing. [[Bran Stark|Bran]] saw this image in a vision way back in [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]]'s "[[The Lion and the Rose]]" and again [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]]'s "[[Blood of My Blood]]."
*It had previously been said that [[Aerys II Targaryen|the Mad King]] ordered caches of [[wildfire]] placed all over [[King's Landing]] ("[[Kissed by Fire]]"). These caches are ignited by [[Drogon]]'s dragonfire.
*Jaime's final words to Cersei are "Nothing else matters," echoing what he had said to her in "[[The Red Woman]]."
*Jaime dies in Cersei's arms, the woman he loves, which is how he said he wanted to go out in "[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]."
*Gregor attempts to gouge out Sandor's eyeballs in the same way he did to [[Oberyn Martell]] in "[[The Mountain and the Viper]]."
*While being lifted in the air, the Hound repeatedly stabs the Mountain, but to no avail, as Jon did while fighting [[Othor]] in "[[The Pointy End]]".
*The Hound drives a dagger through the Mountain's eye, as Jaime did to [[Jory Cassel]] in "[[The Wolf and the Lion]]". Driving a dagger "through his eye and out the back of his skull" is also how Arya described how she would kill the Hound in "[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]".
*The Mountain grabs hold of the Hound's blade with his bare hand, as the Hound did while fighting [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] in "[[The Children]]".
*The Hound eventually kills his brother, as he said he would in "[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]".
*Varys tells Jon "They say every time a Targaryen is born, the gods toss a coin and the world holds its breath" - similarly to what Cersei said in "[[A Man Without Honor]]".
*Tyrion visits the pen in which Jaime is held prisoner, in order to release him, as Catelyn did in "A Man Without Honor".
*Tyrion and Daenerys refer to the liberation of the slaves in Meereen ("[[Breaker of Chains]]").
*Daenerys warns Tyrion "The next time you fail me will be the last time you fail me". It echoes what she said to [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] in "[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]": "The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands".
*Tyrion says that he defended King's Landing the last time it was attacked, referring to the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].
*Daenerys devastates King's Landing by burning much of it with dragonfire, as [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]] had [[Wildfire plot|sought to do with wildfire]], when the city was [[Sack of King's Landing|sacked]] during [[Robert's Rebellion]].

===On Dragonstone===
*The dialogue of Varys and Martha implies that Varys tried to poison Daenerys.
**Martha tells Varys that "she isn't eating", presumably referring to Daenerys, and Varys appears pensive before telling her "we'll try again at supper", implying that Varys had some sort of plan regarding Daenerys's food. Given his recent misgivings about Daenerys's sanity, poison seems the most likely answer.
**Martha also notes how the soldiers at Dragonstone are watching her, perhaps suggesting that Daenerys suspects someone may try to poison her.
**Additionally, Varys removes multiple rings from his fingers prior to being taken by Grey Worm - it's possible the poison was kept in these rings, similarly to how Olenna Tyrell and Petyr Baelish smuggled poison into Joffrey's wedding, using a hairnet.
**It is the third unsuccessful attempt to poison Daenerys, following the attempts in "[[You Win or You Die]]" and "[[Valar Dohaeris]]".
*Similarly to the executions of [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]] and [[Dickon Tarly]], Daenerys's method of executing Varys is perhaps more impressive than a simple beheading, but in both cases it could have caused the spectators to associate Daenerys with [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]], who used to burn people to death - which is exactly what she has been trying to avoid so far, till the point she decides to destroy King's Landing.

===In King's Landing===
'''Targaryens'''
*Interestingly, Daenerys's actions in this episode are the exact the opposite of [[Jon Connington]]'s in the [[Battle of the Bells]]:
**When Connington arrived at [[Stoney Sept]], he could have possibly put an end to [[Robert's Rebellion]], had he set the entire town on fire (what Tywin would have probably done); Robert would have surely been killed in the process. He did not, because many innocent people would have been killed (he also wanted the glory of capturing Robert by his own hands); while his soldiers conducted a house-to-house search, the Stark, Tully and Arryn troops arrived and drove Connington's troops away. Connington's act of mercy cost him and the Targaryens dearly.
**Daenerys, on the other hand, has destroyed the city and killed countless innocent people. In her case, it has been totally unnecessary, for the Lannister soldiers have already yielded, and capturing Cersei (dead or alive) would have been a simple matter.
*Note that even ruthless people like [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] and [[Roose Bolton]], who treated their enemies very cruelly, were against killing enemies who had surrendered:
**Roose rebuked [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay]] for needlessly killing the Ironborn who yielded on two occasions (the [[sack of Winterfell]] and the [[siege of Moat Cailin]]).
**Tywin told [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] in the third novel (chapter 53, Tyrion VI) "when your enemies defy you, you must serve them steel and fire. When they go to their knees, however, you must help them back to their feet. Elsewise no man will ever bend the knee to you. And any man who must say '''I am the king''' is no true king at all".
*In [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|Season 7]] episode "[[Eastwatch]]", Randyll Tarly refused to accept Daenerys as his queen; one of his reasons was that Daenerys brought an army of savages to Westeros. At that point, it seemed somewhat hypocritical of him, since as everyone knows - the Lannisters' bannermen (mainly the Mountain and [[Amory Lorch|Lorch]]) have performed extremely savage atrocities at their masters' orders. In retrospect, however, Randyll was right: Daenerys and her troops proved to be ruthless savages, in view of the destruction and massacre they performed in this episode - which have been far worse than anything the Lannisters and their henchmen have ever did in King's Landing in the past - mainly the [[Sack of King's Landing]] and the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]]; as vicious and despicable as those were, their extent was somewhat limited; Daenerys, by contrast, destroyed most of the city and killed many more innocents.
*In [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]] episode "[[The Wolf and the Lion]]", [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]] objected to kill Daenerys, and did not listen to Varys and [[Pycelle]], who correctly pointed out that either Daenerys died, or many innocent people would. In this episode, it turned to be that Varys and Pycelle were right, while Ned was really acting like a "honorable fool", as [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] called him.
*Daenerys rapidly destroys the Greyjoy fleet and ''all'' of the scorpions in King's Landing. She seems to have realized that both Viserion and Rhaegal were lost during periods of relatively slow movement at low altitude. Therefore, she started with a dive bombing run from above the clouds and stayed on the move once she got into firing range, using strafing instead of bombing maneuvers. Second, while the scorpions' piercing power and possibly reload time were greatly improved, it seems that their turn speed and aiming time were the same as the earlier models, again meaning that all Daenerys needed to do was keep on the move.

'''Starks'''
*Ever since the first episode of this season, [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] (alongside [[Lyanna Mormont]]) had strong reservations about Daenerys; the latter's conduct in this episode proves that Sansa was right to distrust her. However, it could be argued that Sansa is at least partially responsible for Daenerys's actions: as Sansa broke her vow of secrecy to Jon and told Tyrion the truth about Jon, which started a chain of events that led to Varys's betrayal of Daenerys and his death, which in turn contributed to Daenerys's downward spiral.
*[[Arya Stark|Arya]]'s last words to Sandor are the first and only time throughout the entire series someone talks to him by only using his first name. Everybody else, who ever talked to him, generally called him either "Clegane", "Hound" or "Dog".
*With the deaths of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]], Arya's kill list is completed.
**By the point the novels reached, two of the people (the Cleganes) are in uncertain status, and four are still alive - Dunsen (one of the Mountain's men), Cersei, [[Ilyn Payne]] and [[Meryn Trant]].
*In Season 7 episode "[[The Spoils of War]]", Jon was strongly against Daenerys using her three dragons to burn down the Red Keep with Cersei and her allies inside, warning her that if she resorts to "melting castles and cities", this will make her no different than the more tyrannical members of her family that came before her. Jon's warning was later proven true when Daenerys burned King's Landing and the Red Keep, albeit only with Drogon and without Viserion and Rhaegal.
'''Royces'''

*Ever since Season 7, [[Yohn Royce]], like Sansa, is strongly distrustful of Daenerys and her family, as he remembers the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]] too well. This leads Yohn to conclude "that a Targaryen cannot be trusted". Though this is later proven to be true in repsect of Daenerys (the [[Battle of King's Landing]]), it proves to be false in repsect of Jon, who is half Targaryen (Yohn is unaware of this). In addition, Jon appears to not suffer any traits of the Targaryen Madness, which is one of the reasons Varys sought to put him on the Iron Throne.

'''Cleganes'''
*It is the second time (following "[[The Winds of Winter]]") that the Mountain reveals his head ever since he was reanimated by Qyburn.
**In the books, Ser Robert Strong (the reanimated Mountain) apparently has no skull; Cersei sent it to the Martells, in attempt to appease the Dornish people. That gesture, however, did little to change Doran's conspiracy against the Lannisters; it has not decreased even slightly the hatred the [[Sand Snakes]] feel toward the Lannisters (though they do not resent [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and do not seek to harm her), definitely not after their uncle revealed to them Cersei's plot to assassinate [[Trystane Martell|their cousin]].

'''Lannisters'''
*It is the second time (following "[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]") that [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] says there are a million people in King's Landing. Still, it does not mean the number is correct; Tyrion might have spoken loosely, underscoring the fact that there are many innocent people who may be killed. Or, it may be possible that he's referring to the addition of the numerous small folk that have entered from the surrounding countryside, as seen in the episode.
*Tyrion tells Jaime "If it weren't for you, I never would've survived my childhood". It is unclear whether Tyrion meant the time Cersei pinched him and Jaime stopped her (as mentioned by Oberyn Martell in "[[Mockingbird]]"), or whether Jaime generally protected him from harm during his childhood. Or, more tragically, Tyrion could be hinting he contemplated suicide due to the abuse he suffered from Tywin and Cersei and it was only Jaime's love and support that prevented him from harming himself.
*Cersei's death does not necessarily refute Maggy's prophecy about the "Valonqar" (a prophecy that was only made in the books). In view of how far the TV show has strayed from the novels, and how much Jaime has grown to hate and loathe Cersei throughout the fourth novel (he even contemplates killing her) - it is still possible that he will be the one to kill her in the novels, according to one of the most common fan speculations about the aforementioned prophecy. It can also be argued that Jaime did indeed kill Cersei, unintentionally leading her to the collapsing tunnels beneath the Red Keep.
*Jaime's statement "I never really cared much for them [the residents of King's Landing]" totally contradicts what he wholeheartedly told to Brienne in "Kissed by Fire" - that he killed Aerys in order to save those people; this is also reason he joined the northern troops in the fight against the army of the dead ("I promised to fight for the living"). It is unclear why Jaime would make such a false statement, which is in sharp contrast to his previous words and deeds, and shows him in a very bad light. There are several possible explanations: perhaps he was simply being defeatist (as he clearly did not believe that he would be able to convince Cersei to change her course of action); perhaps he no longer believed himself worthy of redemption (after choosing to go back to Cersei); or possibly his attitude may have been an attempt to dissuade Tyrion from freeing him, knowing that it would lead to Tyrion's execution.
*Cersei's statement "The [[Red Keep]] has never fallen" is not incorrect: the city has fallen during [[Robert's Rebellion]], but the Red Keep itself was technically not put under siege and taken, as Jaime had already killed the Mad King by the time Lannister troops reached the keep.
*Before the fight between Euron and Jaime begins, Euron says "If you kill another king before you die... they'll sing about you forever"; after he is fatally stabbed by Jaime, Euron yells "Another king for you!" - referring to the first [[Regicide|kingslaying]] Jaime committed.

'''Greyjoys'''
*It is unknown why Yara has not joined Daenerys's forces, after she has [[Retaking of the Iron Islands|taken the Iron Islands]] (as reported in the previous episode). Maybe Yara's loyalists are currently too few, and she has not yet established her reign over the Iron Islands, thus could not rally sufficient forces to assist Daenerys; another possibility is that she had to keep her forces nearby, in case Euron returned and attempted to overthrow her.

'''Possible Motivations for the Destruction'''
:'''Foreshadowing'''

{{Quote|A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing.|[[Aemon]] about his great-niece [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], the "last" scion of his house.|Kill the Boy}} 
*After the death of her brother, Daenerys defined her entire life as the "last scion/Targaryen" and, thinking she was alone in the world, plotted to take control of the [[Iron Throne]]. Discovering that she was not alone was a profoundly destabilizing factor for her; the fact that she fell for [[Jon Snow|another]] Targaryen [[The_Dragon_and_the_Wolf|''before'']] both of them knew and that her feelings towards him were not reciprocated ''after'' it was known, only compounded the dramatic effect upon her psyche.
*The terrible destruction that Daenerys inflicts in this episode has been foreshadowed in previous episodes:
**In "[[The Old Gods and the New]]", Daenerys told the [[Spice King]] that she would take what she considered to be hers "with fire and blood", stating the Targaryen motto which did come to reality.
**In "[[A Man Without Honor]]", the Spice King told Daenerys "Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery"; his fear proved to be correct. 
**In "[[Blackwater]]", Varys told Tyrion "I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror. A dead king, a city under siege".
**In "[[Valar Morghulis]]", one of the visions Daenerys saw at the [[House of the Undying]] was of the [[throne room]], ruined and deserted. What seemed to be snow kept dropping from the air, covering the floor and the Iron Throne; in view of this episode, it could have been ashes rather than snow.
**In "[[Stormborn]]", [[Olenna Tyrell]] told Daenerys "You're a dragon. ''Be a dragon"''.
*In "[[Kissed by Fire]]", Jaime told Brienne that "''He'' [Aerys] ''burned lords he didn't like. He burned Hands who disobeyed him. He burned anyone who was against him''". In "[[The House of Black and White]]", Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] told Daenerys that her father "''murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with wildfire''". Upon hearing that, Daenerys insisted "I'm not my father", but eventually has performed all those ruthless acts - and worse:
**She burned Lord Randyll Tarly and his son together;
**She burned Varys (he was her advisor, not her Hand, but it is close enough);
**She burned the Lannister troops;
**She caused the eruption of the hidden wildfire caches, while burning people alive with Drogon's fire.
***It is doubtful Daenerys has set off the wildfire caches on purpose (Tyrion told her about them in "[[Battle of the Bastards (episode)|Battle of the Bastards]]"). She does not express ''in retrospect'' any regret about doing so, and about the killing of many innocent people as a result; that makes her responsible as if she planned that to happen.
**The conclusion is that Daenerys has turned out to be what her father was and more; she even executed [[Wildfire plot|his diabolical plan to destroy King's Landing]], by following his last words ''"Burn them all!"''.

:'''Commentary'''
*'''There was no reason for Daenerys to burn the city itself'''

:*Dan Weiss explains, "I don't think [Daenerys] decided ahead of time that she was going to do what she did. And then she sees the Red Keep, which is, to her, the home that her family built when they first came over to this country 300 years ago. It's in that moment, on the walls of King's Landing, where she's looking at that symbol of everything that was taken from her, when she makes the decision to-- to make this personal." 
:*However, Daenerys does not ''immediately'' attack the [[Red Keep]] itself, she begins strafing the city. This makes no tactical or common sense: it was already well established in previous episodes that Cersei has no affection for the small folk whatsoever, so the possible explanation that Daenerys was burning them to punish Cersei makes no sense, however Daenerys's "punishment", enacted through the burning, may also have been directed at the people of the city themselves, not just Cersei.

*'''There were reasons for Daenerys to burn the city down'''

:*Daenerys's actions during the battle could be foreshadowed by her earlier statement to Jon Snow on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], that if she couldn't inspire the love of the people of Westeros, then it would be fear. According to showrunners, Daenerys did not know at this time that she would decide to burn down the city. Daenerys is mentally broken at this point, so she makes it personal by burning the city down, so she can have it rebuilt as a Targaryen King's Landing.<ref name="ITE">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W8j6wOvxuo]</ref><ref name="GR">[https://youtu.be/RQ9QQMXTftY?t=863]</ref>
:*Daenerys's unreasonable cruelty could also possibly be the result of mounting grief from the losses of many of her friends and allies, as well as two of her dragons, which she considers as her children.
:*It's possible that her hatred was not only directed at Cersei, but also at the citizens of King's Landing for not surrendering to her immediately upon her arrival. In Daenerys's mind, the perfect invasion would have been the instant annihilation of Cersei, with her Tyrell, Greyjoy and Dornish armies intact, as well with all her advisors and dragons by her side. By the time the city surrendered, she had already lost so much, and decided to take her rage out upon the city. Much of Daenerys's losses can be attributed to heeding her Hand Tyrion's advice.
:
*'''Not Alone'''
:*Part of what lead to Daenerys' ''snap'' was likely triggered by the fallout from the discovery of Jon Snow being a Targaryen. This meant two things:
::*He had a better claim to the throne due to being the child of Aerys Targaryen's oldest son, Rhaegar Targaryen.
::*They were blood relatives.
::The discovery of his true identity came about after they had consummated their relationship and had fallen in love<ref name="EWDanyJon">[https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/22/game-of-thrones-emilia-clarke-jon-dany-interview/]</ref><ref>[https://ew.com/tv/2019/04/14/game-of-thrones-kit-harington-reveals-jon-snow-parentage/]</ref><ref name="ITE" />, which seems to have amplified the impact of the revelation.

:*To the first point, she knew that his claim meant he was the rightful heir but she had, until then, ''defined her entire life as being the last Targaryen and rightful heir''. The discovery that Jon was antecedent to the throne was clearly an important, if not the most important, factor. After finding out he was a Targaryen (and her nephew to be precise), Jon made it clear that ''he didn't want the throne'', which seemed to please her.
:*Secondly, as a Targaryen, having an incestuous relationship was not considered taboo, whereas to Starks, it was. Being raised a Stark, Jon has issues with the knowledge that Daenerys was his aunt<ref name="EWDanyJon" /> - issues he clearly didn't have when he was not aware - and was unable to return to sexual intimacy with Daenerys since finding this out. This second denial - of her as a companion - deeply upset her.
:*Daenerys seems happy at Jon's decision to renounce the throne, but deeply unhappy at his inability to resume their romantic relationship due to their blood ties. The tension between these outcomes is revealed when she delivers the fateful line, "Is that all I am to you? Your queen?" This seemed to show that Daenerys needed more than fealty but a companion and partner as well but Jon, having grown up as a Stark, finds their familial connection a barrier to resuming any physical intimacy between them. Though Jon gives into Daenerys's kiss, he breaks it off and it is then Daenerys realizes he is unable to return to the intimacy they once shared before they knew of his parentage, contributing to her declining state. When she delivers the line, "Alright then, let it be fear," it appears she is resigning herself to the fear she already inspires in Westeros and will no longer try to win the people's love. Although, according to the Inside the Episode and Game Revealed sessions, it is not until Daenerys is perched on top of the walls of King's Landing that she decides to burn the city down.<ref name="ITE" /><ref name="GR" />
:
*'''Not Her Father'''
:*When Daenerys said, "I'm not my father," this could be taken one of two ways:
:**1. She is literally not her father; she is morally better than him and would not commit such horrendous acts; she will break the wheel, and be the queen people choose. Or simply, that she is not mad.
:**2. She is not her father in the sense that he made the mistake of having enemies alive to kill him, of getting himself killed, and of not completing the task he set out to.
:*''Interpretation 1'' is a form of misdirection: the interpretation that Daenerys is morally superior to her father due to her seemingly redemptive arc, her rousing rhetoric and her democratic aspirations; however, all the acts listed above would create considerable cognitive dissonance and stretch this interpretation's credulity. Therefore this interpretation only holds so far as the ''tipping point'', after which she moved to the next phase of her arc.
:*''Interpretation 2'' is the more likely (if darker and more tragic) meaning; given what transpired in this episode, it signals the culmination of her unavoidable destiny. Daenerys was abused and sold into marriage by a brother who would happily allow her to be raped in order that he may attain the throne; she then rose from the bottom to the top, forming the keystone of her identity from the belief that it was ''her destiny'' to rule the [[Iron Throne]] ''her way'' as ''she'' was the last of the Targaryens. (When she would eventually discover ''much later'' that this was not true, a tipping point occurred, after which it would be too late for her to change her mindset. This was foreshadowed by [[Aemon]] saying "a Targaryen ''alone'' in the world is a terrible thing."<ref>"[[Kill the Boy]]"</ref>) After she discovered her magical affinity with dragons, raised them to maturity and (perhaps an elaborate ruse) convinced whole armies to fight with her against their common enemy - the Lannisters - she discovered Jon (whom she loved) was ''in fact'' the rightful heir to the throne. After this devastating blow to her identity, compounded with his inability to return her romantic affections, the betrayal of her advisor ([[Varys]]), loss of her closest friends (protector [[Jorah Mormont|Jorah]] and confidant [[Missandei]]), as well as 2 of her children (dragons), she set out to finish her father's work: to conquer the city with fire and blood and ''be a dragon''. After all, ''when you play the game of thrones, you win or you die'': Cersei died; Daenerys intends to win - ''by whatever means necessary.''
