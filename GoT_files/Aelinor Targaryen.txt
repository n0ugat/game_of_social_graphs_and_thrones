Queen '''Aelinor Targaryen''' was both the wife and sister of King [[Aerys Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Aerys I]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Aelinor Targaryen was both the wife and sister of King [[Aerys Targaryen (son of Daeron II)|Aerys I]].{{Ref|GOT104}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Aelinor is mentioned in the [[House Targaryen]]'s entry of the book ''[[The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms]]''.{{Ref|GOT104}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Aelinor is not mentioned precisely as Aerys I's sister-wife, though it was assumed by fandom she was a Targaryen due to the custom of dynastic incest. The prop of the ''Lineages'' book that Eddard reads in Season 1 of the TV series (written by [[Bryan Cogman]]) also made this assumption.

In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', however, it is revealed that she was actually a member of [[House Penrose]], a noble house from the [[Stormlands]], as well as a cousin to [[House Targaryen]]. This information was only released in 2014, after Season 1. So far there has been no official update to her status in the TV continuity.
