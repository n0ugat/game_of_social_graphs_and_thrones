The Bandit Lords abducted the lord and lady of [[House Dondarrion]] during the reign of King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], and held them hostage at a place called the [[Diamond Cave]]. They were all hunted down and killed by Ser [[Gwayne Gaunt]],{{Note|The paragraph mentioning this event is erroneously placed in Arthur Dayne's entry. The opening sentence calling him the "thirdborn son to Lord Symon of House Gaunt" makes it apparent that this paragraph was meant for Gwayne Gaunt's entry.|name=Gwayne Gaunt}} a member of the [[Kingsguard]]. Gwayne later rescued Lord Dondarrion and his wife from the bandits.

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
