'''Starfall'''{{Ref|H&L613}} is a castle in [[Dorne]], the region controlled by [[House Martell]] of [[Sunspear]], and the seat of [[House Dayne]]. The castle is located in the far west of Dorne, near the border with the [[Reach]] and south of [[Blackmont]].

In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Starfall is the seat of House Dayne. It is located at the mouth of the River Torentine, downriver from Blackmont and the High Hermitage, which is held by a lesser branch of the Daynes.

Starfall is so-called because of a meteor, referred to as a "fallen star," which fell out of the sky nearby, almost two thousand years ago. The Daynes forged a sword out of the meteorite ore, called "[[Dawn]]," which is as resilient and formidable as a [[Valyrian steel]] weapon in combat.
