==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the coat-of-arms of House Massey is a triple spiral; red, green, and blue, on white. Originally of the [[First Men]], their founder Maldon Massey built [[Stonedance]] and ruled Massey's Hook as a vassal to the [[Storm King]] Durran the Ravenfriend. During the reign of Durwald I "the Fat," the Masseys broke away from the [[Stormlands]] and established their own kingdom, claiming the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush]] river. In the [[coming of the Andals]], the Storm King Qarlton II "the Conqueror" laid siege to Stonedance and eventually killed King Josua Massey, bringing their lands back under [[House Durrandon|Durrandon]] dominion. Less than two years later, the [[Andals|Andal]] warlord Togarion [[House Bar Emmon|Bar Emmon]] married Josua's daughter and expelled the Durrandons from Stonedance, installing Josua's son as a puppet ruler. Eventually, the Andals made peace with the Durrandons and married with them.

During [[Aegon's Conquest]], the Masseys were once again vassals of House Durrandon. When Aegon finally invaded however, the Masseys instantly supported him rather than Storm King [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]], as they had closer ties with [[Dragonstone]] than with [[Storm's End]]. After the Conquest, Triston Massey was named King Aegon's [[Master of Laws|master of laws]], and the Masseys were brought under direct Targaryen rule as a house of the [[Crownlands]].

Lord Lucifer Massey fought for [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor I Targaryen]] in his [[Trial by seven of Maegor Targaryen|trial of seven]], in which he was killed by Ser [[Harys Horpe]] of the [[Faith Militant|Warrior's Sons]].

The Masseys marched on [[Whitewalls]] with [[Brynden Rivers]] to put down the [[Second Blackfyre Rebellion]].
