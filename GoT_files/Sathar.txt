'''Sathar''',{{Ref|H&L608}} also known as the '''Waterfall City'''{{Ref|H&L608}} and referred to by the [[Dothraki]] as the '''Place of Wailing Children''',{{Ref|H&L608}} was a city of the [[Kingdom of Sarnor]].

==History==
Sathal was laid waste to by a [[Dothraki]] horde led by [[Khal]] [[Moro (son of Mengo)|Moro]]. Following its destruction, Moro renamed it "The Place of Wailing Children". This caused the [[Sarnori]] to realize how big of a threat the Dothraki were and rally behind the High King [[Mazor Alexi]].<ref>"[[The Dothraki]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Sathar bordered the central [[Dothraki Sea]]. In the period in which the novels is set, the ruins of the city of are known as Yalli Qamayi, "The Place of Wailing Children".

[[Daenerys Targaryen]] travels north of the city whilst Khal [[Drogo]]'s ''[[khalasar]]'' makes its journey from [[Pentos]] to [[Vaes Dothrak]].
