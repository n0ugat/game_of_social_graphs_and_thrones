{{Quote|Your Grace, I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark, sent as an envoy by her son, Robb, Lord of Winterfell.|Colen to Renly Baratheon|What Is Dead May Never Die}}
Ser '''Colen of Greenpools'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a [[Knighthood|knight]] serving King [[Renly Baratheon]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
He announces [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] when she arrives at [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]]'s camp close to [[Storm's End]]. He introduces her as an envoy of [[Robb Stark]], [[Lord of Winterfell]]. She corrects him and adds that Robb is also [[King in the North]].{{Ref|GOT203}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Colen makes a very brief appearance: he welcomes Catelyn and her escorts, as they approach Renly's camp, then escorts her the rest of the way there and introduces her to Renly. He is described as grizzled, with a grey beard. His personal coat-of-arms has bluejays on it.

Ser Colen is not mentioned in the novels afterwards. It is unknown whether, after [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|Renly's death]], he goes over to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] or remains with the [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] host.
