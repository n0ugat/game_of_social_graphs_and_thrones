{{Quote|Aegon sent his commander, Orys Baratheon to take Storm's End. Argilac the Arrogant, the last of the Storm Kings, foolishly left the safety of his stronghold, and met the Baratheon warlord in open battle. Argilac was soundly defeated, and Orys took his lands, his holdings and his daughter. Orys was said to be a half-brother to Aegon Targaryen. If this were true a little "blood of the dragon" mingled with that of the stag in those days.|[[Robert Baratheon]] on his ancestor|House Baratheon (short)}}
Lord '''Orys Baratheon''' was the founder of [[House Baratheon]], and a general in the army of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon I Targaryen]], to whom he was rumored to be a [[bastard]] half-brother.

==Biography==
===Background===
Orys Baratheon is the founder of [[House Baratheon]] and is the distant ancestor of King [[Robert Baratheon]] and his brothers, [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]].{{Ref|H&L121}}

During [[Aegon's Conquest]], he was a commander in the army of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], and was rumored to be the Conqueror's [[bastard]] half-brother. When Aegon invaded [[Westeros]], he sent Orys to seize [[Storm's End]], the ancestral seat of the [[Storm King]]s and capital of the [[Stormlands]]. Orys defeated the Storm King, [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]], and [[Last Storm|took]] not only Storm's End but also his sigil (the crowned black stag) and words ("Ours is the Fury"), as well as his daughter [[Argella Baratheon|Argella]], and his sword, Torment, to cement his rule over the Stormlands. He became the first [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]].{{Ref|H&L121}}

[[File:Orys_argalia.jpg|thumb|right|Orys Baratheon took Argella, daughter of the last Storm King, as his wife, to cement his rule over the Stormlands]]

''The World of Ice and Fire'' reveals that Orys Baratheon was Aegon's closest friend and ally. He served Aegon as the first-ever [[Hand of the King]], as well as the commander of his forces. Aegon offered Orys's hand in marriage to the daughter of the Storm King, Argilac Durrandon, but was rebuffed. Angered at the insult of being offered a bastard instead of a king, Argilac cut off the hands of Aegon's envoys.

When Aegon landed his army at the mouth of the [[Blackwater Rush]], he led a lightning campaign to secure the surrounding area, taking [[Rosby]], Stokeworth, [[Duskendale]] and [[Maidenpool]] in short order. Orys led the army while Aegon attacked from the skies.

After this victory, Aegon sent Orys and his sister-wife [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] to take Storm's End. Argilac left his castle to give battle in the open, attacking during a torrential thunderstorm to limit the use of Rhaenys's dragon, [[Meraxes]]. However, Meraxes instead fought on foot and was still able to inflict carnage on Argilac's forces. Argilac himself was slain by Orys. Orys negotiated the surrender of Storm's End, with Argilac's daughter Argella delivered to him in chains and naked. Orys treated her kindly and later wed her.

Orys continued to serve Aegon as Hand of the King until the [[First Dornish War]], during which his hand was cut off by the Wyl of Wyl while in captivity. Orys would afterwards be known as Orys ''One-Hand'' and ''the King's Stump'', and after his return to the [[Red Keep|Aegonfort]], resign as Hand of the King due to a sense of lost pride. He was later replaced in the office by a succession of men, including Lord Edmyn Tully, Lord Alton Celtigar, Ser Osmund Strong, and Lord Alyn Stokeworth. Nevertheless, he remained an important figure at the Conqueror's court, standing by Queen Visenya when Princess Deria presented Aegon I with Dorne's terms to end the war between their two realms. Orys outlived the Conqueror and served Aenys I, who succeeded Aegon I upon his death. Orys later died during one of the numerous local rebellions against Aenys I: many lords hoped that with Aegon the Conqueror dead and his weak son on the throne, they might be able to throw off Targaryen rule forever. These rebellions were crushed by Aegon's ruthless younger son, [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]], who succeeded Orys as Hand of the King.<ref>[http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/topic/83614-bubonicon-45/page__st__40 Bubonicaon 45 GRRM live-read]</ref>

Archmaester Gyldayn believes Orys to be Aegon's bastard brother with a certainty; in ''Fire & Blood'', Gyldayn writes about Orys and Aegon's brotherhood as fact, and even claims that Orys's grandson Rogar boasted that he was the blood of the dragon.<ref>''[[Fire & Blood]]'' by [[George R.R. Martin]]</ref>

The relationship between Aegon the Conqueror and Orys Baratheon may be loosely inspired by that of the real-world William the Conqueror of Normandy and Odo of Bayeux, who was the Norman conqueror's half-brother (Orys was rumored to be Aegon's half-brother) and vassal, and upon the conquest of England, was made the ruling earl of an important region of England and was his brother's regent and chancellor in that country.
