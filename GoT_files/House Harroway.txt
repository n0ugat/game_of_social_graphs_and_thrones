'''House Harroway'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} of Harrenhal is an extinct noble house of the [[Riverlands]]. Their sigil was per bend sinister orange and black rayonne, a castle counterchanged.

Their seat was the castle of [[Harrenhal]], which was granted to them after the extinction of [[House Qoherys]]. However, the Harroways also died out, and the castle was passed on to [[House Towers]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Harroway's backstory is the same. There is a town, called [[Lord Harroway's Town]], that is named after a former lord of the house.

King [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]]'s second wife was [[Alys Harroway]].
