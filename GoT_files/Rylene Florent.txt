{{Quote|To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon. Invaded-- inv-- invit-- invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first night--|[[Davos Seaworth]] reads Rylene's letter to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]|Mhysa}}
'''Rylene Florent''' is a cousin of [[Shireen Baratheon]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
During one of [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]]'s lessons, [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] reads a letter sent to [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] with an invitation to Rylene Florent's [[nameday]]. Later, when reading about [[Balerion]], he humorously comments that dragon is better than anything that Rylene has got on offer.{{Ref|GOT310}}

==Family==
{{Florent tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Rylene Florent is not Shireen's cousin, but [[Selyse Baratheon|her mother]]'s paternal aunt, which makes her Shireen's great-aunt, as well as the aunt of [[Imry Florent]] and [[Melessa Tarly]]. She is married to Ser Rycherd Crane.

Rylene does not appear in the novels, only mentioned in the appendices of the second, third, and fourth novels.

Davos describes her as Shireen's "cousin" in the Season 3 finale, but he may have just been speaking loosely.
