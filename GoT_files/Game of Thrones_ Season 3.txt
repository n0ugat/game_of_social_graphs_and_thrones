{{Premise|GOT3}}

==Overview==
Season 3 spans several months on a world where the seasons can last for years at a time. Autumn has fallen across the world, with winter not far behind. The people should be preparing for years of snow and ice, but the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]] instead remain gripped by [[War of the Five Kings|civil war]]. Would-be king [[Renly Baratheon]] has been [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|assassinated]], altering the alliances in the war. The cruel boy-king [[Joffrey Baratheon]] has won a great victory by securing an alliance with [[House Tyrell]], with his supporters defeating his uncle [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] in an [[Battle of the Blackwater|epic battle]]. Joffrey now commands the largest armies in the realm and his triumph appears inevitable.

King [[Robb Stark]] remains in the field, however his homeland, the [[North]], is partially under [[Ironborn]] occupation. Robb needs to decide on a course of action to win an overall victory. He must also win back the allegiance of [[House Frey]], whom he has offended by breaking his marriage pact with them. King Robb has won every battle he has fought, but as with old King [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], the Starks will have to see if good soldiers make good kings.

Stannis Baratheon may be defeated and most of his army destroyed or scattered, but he is not out of the fight yet. Having retreated to his headquarters on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] island with his handful of surviving soldiers, Stannis' status as the last legitimate heir to his older brother Robert still casts a shadow over Joffrey's claim to the throne. With the [[Red priest|priestess]] [[Melisandre]] at his side, Stannis can still influence the course of the war by striking where least expected.

The lives of many others still hang in the balance. [[Bran Stark]] and his protectors must cross the frozen wastelands of the North to reach the [[Wall]], while [[Arya Stark|Arya]] must brave the war-torn [[Riverlands]] in search of her mother and brother. [[Brienne of Tarth]] also has the thankless task of escorting the captive [[Jaime Lannister]] home across hundreds of miles of battlefields and carnage. [[Theon Greyjoy]] must face the consequences of his actions at [[Winterfell]]. And in [[King's Landing]] both [[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Sansa Stark]] must brave the currents of a much more dangerous court in order to survive.

On the [[Essos|eastern continent]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has fled the political viper-pit of [[Qarth]]. Her [[dragon]]s are growing and her fame is spreading, but to take the [[Iron Throne]] she will need supporters and an army. Both may be found in the corrupt cities of [[Slaver's Bay]]... for a price.

[[Beyond the Wall]], the [[White Walkers]] are on the move, threatening both the Seven Kingdoms and the lands of the [[Free Folk]]. While the [[Night's Watch]] faces the threat of the White Walkers in the field, [[Jon Snow]] must infiltrate the wildling army of [[Mance Rayder]] and discover the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]]'s plans.

==Production==
The series again filmed primarily in Northern Ireland,<ref>[http://northernirelandscreen.co.uk/news/2919/game-of-thrones-season-3-to-film-in-northern-ireland.aspx Northern Ireland Screen article about season 3]</ref> and also returned to Iceland and Croatia.<ref name=nsnews>[http://www.nsnews.com/entertainment/movie-guide/Cinematographer+eyes+Irish+project/6823119/story.html "Cinematographer Eyes Irish Project", North Shore News]</ref> The production also added Morocco to the locations roster.<ref name=nsnews/>The production expanded to three production units, adding a new "Raven" unit to the existing "Dragon" and "Wolf" units.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/10/mgot-three-filming-units-confirmed/ Winter is Coming]</ref>

Production in Croatia continued to use the walled medieval city of Dubrovnik to film external scenes for [[King's Landing]], and Iceland was again used to film scenes set in the frozen lands that [[Jon Snow]] and the [[Night's Watch]] encounter [[Beyond the Wall]]. Production in the new location of Morocco filmed [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s new storyline in [[Slaver's Bay]] as well as some King's Landing exterior shots.

The scene from the episode "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair (episode)|The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]" during which Brienne of Tarth is thrown into a bear pit at [[Harrenhal]] involved a real trained stunt bear, [[Bart the Bear 2]]. Due to are various legal restrictions on international transport of large animals such as bears, parts of this scene were ''technically'' filmed in Los Angeles in the United States.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/01/nikolaj-coster-waldau-confirms-two-more-days-of-shooting/ WinterIsComing.net], January 28th, 2013.</ref> A duplicate of the bear pit set was created in a Los Angeles studio parking lot: only Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime) were brought in to film, with no extras. Both actually did film with the bear in the set.<ref>http://web.archive.org/web/20150505160816/http://queensu.ca/alumnireview/woman-action-michelle-maclaren-artsci86</ref>

Filming in Season 1 included locations in Northern Ireland and Malta, but filming did not return to Malta in subsequent seasons. The Targaryen storyline in [[Pentos]] was filmed in the Maltese presidential palace (as well as a few other scenes for King's Landing). Maltese officials were reportedly annoyed that a nude scene was filmed in the palace (Daenerys's bath in the first episode), which may have influenced why production did not return to that country.

Season 2 expanded to film in Croatia and Iceland, and filming continued in those two countries through Season 3 and Season 4. In Season 3 production expanded to Morocco, but did not return to Morocco for Season 4.

The result is that the production on Season 3 was a monumental, international effort involving units and cast members which were filming ''simultaneously'' in four separate countries. The series has filmed in five countries overall, but filming in Malta ended before production expanded to the other three countries. This number increases to six if one counts the footage of the actor-bear used in Season 3. Because filming did not return to Morocco in Season 4, this makes Season 3 the most widespread international filming project that the TV series has engaged in to date.

==Awards==
The episode "[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]" won the 2014 Hugo Award for "Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form". The Season 2 episode "[[Blackwater]]" won the same award the year before. Season 1 was nominated differently: instead of selecting a single episode for "Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form", all of "Season 1" was nominated in the separate category "Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form", and it won the award. Afterwards it was decided to shift to nominating an individual episode from each season in the "Short Form" category. Therefore the win by "The Rains of Castamere" makes this the third year in a row that ''Game of Thrones'' has won the top award it was nominated in at the Hugo Awards.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-thrones-wins-hugo-award/ Game of Thrones Wins Hugo Award].</ref>
