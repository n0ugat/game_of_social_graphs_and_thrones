{{Quote|Sansa can keep her sewing needles, I've got a needle of my own.|Arya Stark|The Kingsroad}}
'''Needle'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is a smallsword wielded by [[Arya Stark]]. It was given to her by [[Jon Snow]], who had it made by [[Mikken]], the blacksmith of [[Winterfell]]. The sword is well suited to Arya's slight build, which prevents her from fighting in the style of large male Westerosi [[Knighthood|knights]], who employ powerful slashing moves and strong blocks using a heavy sword. Instead, Arya and Needle are much better suited to the "[[water dance]]" style of fencing popular in [[Braavos]] and other [[Free Cities]], which emphasizes speed and agility with a thin, light smallsword used in quick thrusting attacks.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Mikken.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Mikken, the blacksmith of Winterfell, forged Needle on Jon Snow's request.]]
Jon gets the sword from Mikken as [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] comes up to taunt him about him joining the [[Night's Watch]]. Later, Jon gives the sword to Arya while she prepares her luggage for her journey to [[King's Landing]] with [[Eddard Stark|her father]], and he is going to the [[Wall]] with his uncle Benjen. He says it is skinny like her and gives her the advice of "stick them with the pointy end". She gives the sword its name as a reference to how [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] has always been better at needlework. "Sansa can keep her sewing needles; I've got a needle of my own."<ref>"[[The Kingsroad]]"</ref>

After a fight with Sansa, her father comes in to talk to Arya who is practicing with Needle. Realizing that even if he commands her not to she is determined to learn on her own, her father decides that he might as well provide her with formal instruction. He hires a [[Braavos]]i master swordsman, [[Syrio Forel]], to train her in the [[water dance]], the Braavosi swordfighting style.

While Eddard was arrested, Needle had been packed in the luggage in the stable in preparation for Sansa and Arya to take a ship back to Winterfell. Arya goes there to find that the Stark men are dead, but Needle is still in the bottom of her trunk. As she is retrieving it a [[stableboy]] tries to stop her and as they struggle she accidentally runs him through with her sword. Horrified, Arya takes Needle with her and flees the [[Red Keep]].<ref>"[[The Pointy End]]"</ref>

She still has the sword with her as she lives on the streets of the city catching pigeons. When she sees her father about to be executed at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], she tries to draw her sword and rush to his side, but is stopped by [[Yoren]], a Night's Watch recruiter that had earlier encountered Arya and her father. After Eddard is executed, Yoren takes Arya - disguised as a boy named "Arry" - heading back north with his recruits, intending to take her to the safety of Winterfell.<ref>"[[Baelor]]"</ref>

[[File:Arya.png|180x180px|thumb|Arya threatens Hot Pie with Needle.]]
Arya threatens one of the recruits, [[Hot Pie]], when he tries to take Needle, noting that she's already killed one fat boy with it. [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], being trained in smithy, recognizes the sword as castle-forged steel, and asks Arya from whom she stole  it. Arya replies that she didn't steal it; the sword was a gift.<ref>"[[Fire and Blood]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Having reached the [[Riverlands]], Yoren's group of recruits is [[Fight at the holdfast|attacked]] by Lannister forces working with the [[City Watch of King's Landing|gold cloaks]]. Yoren is killed, and the recruits are captured. Before leaving to [[Harrenhal]], [[Polliver]], a man-at-arms serving under Ser [[Amory Lorch]], takes Needle from Arya, laughs that "maybe I'll pick my teeth with it", and then mercilessly uses it to kill [[Lommy]].<ref>"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
After spotting Polliver at the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], Arya notices that he still has Needle, and insists on going after him. [[Sandor Clegane|The Hound]] sneers that she gave her sword a name. He tries to stop Arya going in but she rushes on ahead, and he follows her. Inside, a ferocious fight erupts between the Hound, Polliver, and a group of Lannister men-at-arms. Arya recovers Needle from Polliver and kills him, as a payback for what he did to her friend. She then triumphantly rides away with the Hound, having finally recovered her sword.<ref>"[[Two Swords]]"</ref>

One morning, the Hound wakes up and finds Arya practicing with Needle. He scoffs at Arya's "water dancing", believing it is a waste of time when it comes to fighting armored knights. The Hound gives her chance to prove him wrong and Arya tries to stab him in the stomach, but she cannot pierce his armor with Needle.<ref>"[[First of His Name]]"</ref>

Later, Arya and Sandor come across [[Rorge]] and [[Biter]], whom Arya had met while traveling with Yoren. Arya kills Rorge by stabbing him with Needle.<ref>"[[Mockingbird]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
After initially being denied entrance to the [[House of Black and White]], Arya finds herself scrounging for food on the streets of [[Braavos]]. She successfully decapitates a small bird with Needle before being set upon a group of thugs.

In order for Arya to become "no one", she must discard her possessions. She tosses her clothes and silver into the lagoon, but she hesitates to throw Needle. Arya cannot bring herself to discard Jon's gift and hides Needle under a pile of rocks in a sea wall nearby.<ref>"[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:Arya_no_one_ep.jpg|thumb|Arya with Needle before killing the Waif.]]
After failing to assassinate a [[Lady Crane|target]] for the [[Faceless Men]], Arya retrieves Needle from the sea wall and takes it with her to a hideout.<ref>"[[Blood of My Blood]]"</ref> After becoming a target for assassination herself, Arya kills the [[Waif]] with Needle.<ref>"[[No One]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Arya uses Needle when she spars with [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] at Winterfell.<ref>"[[The Spoils of War]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Upon reuniting with Arya, Jon remarks that she still has Needle with her and asks her whether she ever used it. Arya, in an euphemism of her past actions, coyly replies that she only used the sword "once or twice".<ref>"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

Arya tells Jon her plan to sail into the [[Sunset Sea]] and discover what lies to the west of Westeros. Although it pains him to say goodbye to her, Jon only asks if she has Needle with her, and Arya replies that she does. The sword is seen at her side as her ship sails into unknown waters.<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>  

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Needle is a sword, forged by Mikken as a gift from Jon to Arya. The first night after her escape from the Red Keep, Arya has everything stolen from her except Needle. Fortunately, she was sleeping on it or she would have lost it too. During her time in Flea Bottom, she is careful to keep the sword hidden, as it may cause people to question her having it.

Polliver does not kill Lommy with Needle in the books. Instead, Raff the Sweetling kills him by driving a spear into his throat. Since Polliver was composited with Raff in the TV series, in the TV series Arya kills him in the same manner that she kills Raff in the sixth book.
