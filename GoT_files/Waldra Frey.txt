{{Quote|My daughter, Waldra.|Lord [[Walder Frey]] to Robb Stark|The Rains of Castamere (episode)}}
'''Waldra Frey '''is one of the many daughters of [[Walder Frey]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Waldra is one of the many daughters of [[Walder Frey]], the [[Lord of the Crossing]].{{Ref|GOT309}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Along with several of Lord Frey's other daughters and granddaughters, [[Robb Stark]] had the option of marrying her. When he arrives at the [[Twins]] for his uncle [[Edmure Tully|Edmure]]'s [[Red Wedding|wedding]], Robb apologizes for his slight against them.{{Ref|GOT309}}

==Family==
{{Frey tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, some of Lord Walder's descendants name their offspring Walder or Walda to incur Lord Walder's favor - a custom the Lord of the Crossing finds annoying. There's no mention of a daughter of Lord Walder named "Waldra" (apparently a variant of "Walda"), nor of any of his granddaughters or great-granddaughters having the name "Waldra".
