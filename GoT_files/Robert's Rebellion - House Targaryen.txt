==Narration==
'''Viserys Targaryen''': ''The [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]], blood of the dragon and the last of [[Old Valyria]], were loved by their subjects and admired far and wide as the greatest dynasty in the history of the western world.''

''But the peace and prosperity of nearly three centuries of Targaryen rule were shattered by the Usurper, [[Robert Baratheon]], and his band of traitors.''

''[[House Baratheon]] owed its very existence to the Targaryens. Was it not [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Dragon]], himself, who elevated the [[bastard]] [[Orys Baratheon]] in the [[Aegon's Conquest|War of Conquest]]?''

''And what of the [[House Stark|Starks]]? The [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]? The [[House Arryn|Arryns]] of the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]]?''

''All had been spared and allowed to keep their lands when Aegon could easily have wiped them out. Centuries later, the Usurper and his lackeys repaid Aegon's benevolence with treachery.''

''There are some who dare to claim Robert and his allies had reason to rebel. They say the crown prince stole the Usurper's [[Lyanna Stark|lady love]].''

''They say my father, King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]], murdered [[Rickard Stark]] and [[Brandon Stark|his son]] without just cause. Whether these charges are true or not, it doesn't matter! The dragon answers to no one.''

''Aerys's good name has been besmirched in the years since the rebellion. He has been called a dangerous madman, a monster, a tyrant that brought his tragic end upon himself.''

''Lies! My father was a victim of weaklings in his [[Small Council|council]]! Lackwits who failed him in his hour of need, and let the rebellion spin out of control!''

''But it was not enough. The royal army was crushed at the [[Battle of the Trident]]. It was there the valiant Rhaegar met Robert in single combat, but the gods betrayed him, and he perished by the Usurper's hand.''

''As the [[Field of Fire]] had marked the end of the Andals centuries before, the Battle of the Trident seemed to herald the end of the dragon kings.''

''When word reached the capital of my brother Rhaegar's death, my father Aerys moved to protect me, as I was the surviving heir to the [[Iron Throne|throne]].''

''He sent me to the island fortress of Dragonstone, along with my mother, Queen [[Rhaella Targaryen|Rhaella]], who was great with child. But as my father, my king, Aerys Targaryen, prepared to defend his throne to the bitter end, little did he know of the horrors and betrayals that awaited him and our family.''
