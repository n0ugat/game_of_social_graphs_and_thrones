==Narration==
'''Tywin Lannister''': ''[[Rhaegar Targaryen]] lay dead on the banks of the [[Trident]], his royal army [[Battle of the Trident|shattered]] and in retreat. The days of the [[House Targaryen|dragon kings]] were clearly numbered. Until that moment it would have been foolish to commit [[Casterly Rock]] to either the [[Iron Throne|crown]] or the [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]]. What would [[House Lannister]] have to gain in supporting a [[Aerys II Targaryen|raving madman]] or in entering a crusade to put [[Robert Baratheon]] on the [[Iron Throne]]?''

''But chaos benefits no one. It was time for [[House Lannister]] to do what it could to ensure a return of peace and prosperity to the land. I, [[Tywin Lannister]], brought ten thousand Lannister troops to the gates of [[King's Landing]], in order to bring the bloodshed to a quick and decisive conclusion. King Aerys had been sending [[raven]]s for months begging for my support to end the uprising. In a way, his pleas had been answered.''

''As I had suspected, Aerys opened the city gates and welcomed my men. Our plan was clear: crush Aerys's remaining bannermen and remove the remnants of the royal family as quickly and efficiently as possible. Any alternative meant years of further war and a fragmented [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Our means were bloody, but the results speak for themselves.''

''As for Aerys, it is true he met his fate at the hands of [[Jaime Lannister|my son]]. Aerys had kept Jaime close during the rebellion, thinking himself clever in keeping my son as a [[hostage]] - should I decide to pledge support to the rebel cause. This proved to be his greatest mistake, for when the time came Jaime did his duty as a Lannister... and drove his sword into the Mad King's back.''

''With that, Robert Baratheon's crown was secured. The new king recognized our role in his ascension to the throne, just as he recognized how useful the might and riches of [[Casterly Rock]] would be... if he wanted to keep it. To that end, I offered my daughter [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] as his queen. Had Aerys not spurned this same offer years earlier, perhaps things would have worked out differently.''

''With Robert and Cersei crowned as [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] and [[King|Queen]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], it was a new day. The dragon was vanquished, and the Seven Kingdoms would thereafter belong to the stag... and the lion.''
