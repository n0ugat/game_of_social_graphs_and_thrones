'''Peter Hayden Dinklage''' (born June 11, 1969) is an American Golden Globe-winning actor and film producer who has worked in television, film, and on stage. He has starred in ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Tyrion Lannister]] since [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]].

==Early life==
Dinklage stands 4-feet-5-inches tall as an adult, and was born with [[Wikipedia:Achondroplasia|achondroplastic dwarfism]]. Dinklage grew up in the suburbs around [[Wikipedia:Morristown, New Jersey|Morristown, New Jersey]]. Despite being born with a physical difference, Dinklage has described his childhood as uneventful. His father was an insurance salesman who enjoyed fly fishing, and his mother was an elementary school music teacher. He had a painful surgery when he was five years old to straighten his leg bones, but otherwise, he feels he didn't receive any kind of special treatment due to his physical condition, and felt he was treated like an ordinary person.<ref name="EsquireMarch2014">''Esquire'' magazine, March 2014, Peter Dinklage interview.</ref>

Dinklage attended an all-boys Catholic high school. He still described himself as Catholic while filming ''Game of Thrones''. One of the priests at the school had an extensive VHS collection of classic movies and television, which he let Peter watch. As a result he was exposed at a young age to the cinematic works of [[Wikipedia:Federico Fellini|Federico Fellini]], [[Wikipedia:John Cassavetes|John Cassavetes]], and [[Wikipedia:Michelangelo Antonioni|Michelangelo Antonioni]].<ref name="EsquireMarch2014">''Esquire'' magazine, March 2014, Peter Dinklage interview.</ref>

Dinklage attended [[Wikipedia:Bennington College|Bennington College]] in Vermont, and in his freshman year appeared in a student production of ''The Cherry Orchard'' as Firs the butler. His college friends call him "Dink". After graduating from Bennington in 1991, Dinklage spent the next seven years working full time at a company called Professional Examination Service while trying to get acting gigs (he said he couldn't recall much of what he did there and he just punched numbers into a computer). In the meantime, he performed in a punk-funk-rap band called "Whizzy", and had some early plans to form a Steppenwolf-inspired theater company in Williamsburg called "Giant" (though these latter plans came to naught).<ref name="EsquireMarch2014">''Esquire'' magazine, March 2014, Peter Dinklage interview.</ref>

Dinklage continued to seek a career in writing and acting. He adamantly refused to attend seasonal commercial calls for roles as elves or leprechauns, despite needing the money, and struggled to distinguish himself as an actor who also happened to have dwarfism. Over time he fell in with and befriended a crowd of indie project filmmakers including Steve Buscemi, director Alexandre Rockwell, and Tom McCarthy.<ref name="EsquireMarch2014">''Esquire'' magazine, March 2014, Peter Dinklage interview.</ref>

==Career==
Dinklage's acting debut was the film ''[[Wikipedia:Living in Oblivion|Living in Oblivion]]'' (1995), in which he plays a dwarf actor who is frustrated about the clichéd roles for dwarfs in the movie industry and makes an angry rant criticizing it to his director (played by Buscemi). When McCarthy later made the script for ''[[wikipedia:The Station Agent|The Station Agent]]'' (2003) he wrote it with Dinklage in mind as the lead, and the part became his breakout role.<ref name="EsquireMarch2014">''Esquire'' magazine, March 2014, Peter Dinklage interview.</ref>

After ''The Station Agent'', in the next seven years Dinklage appeared in several major films and TV series, including ''[[Wikipedia:Elf (film)|Elf]]'' (2003), the ''[[wikipedia:The Chronicles of Narnia (film series)|Chronicles of Narnia]]'' film series, a series regular on ''[[wikipedia:Threshold (TV series)|Threshold]]'' (2005), and a recurring guest star on ''[[wikipedia:Nip/Tuck|Nip/Tuck]]''.
