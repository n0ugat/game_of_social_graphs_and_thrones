{{Quote|Seeing both the threat and... opportunity the Targaryens represented, Loren wisely surrendered, and aided Aegon in his further conquest of Westeros. The Lannisters were thus appointed Lord Paramount of the Westerlands and Wardens of the West... titles we hold to this day.|[[Tywin Lannister]]|House Lannister (short)}}

==Biography==
[[File:Loren lannister.png|thumb|left|King Loren I bends the knee to Aegon the Conqueror.]]
Loren I Lannister was the last of the [[House Lannister|Lannister]] [[King of the Rock|Kings of the Rock]]. When [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] [[Aegon's Conquest|invaded]] [[Westeros]], King Loren I joined forces with [[Mern IX Gardener]], the [[King of the Reach|King]] of the [[Reach]], to face Aegon in battle.{{Ref|H&L109}}

However, Aegon unleashed his three [[dragon]]s, [[Vhagar]], [[Meraxes]] and [[Balerion]] the Black Dread against the combined might of the Kingdoms of the Reach and the Rock. Four thousand men perished, consumed in a "[[Field of Fire|field of fire]]," including King Mern IX. Seeing he had no chance of victory, King Loren I [[Bending the knee|bent the knee]] to Aegon and gave up his crown. He was named [[Warden of the West]].{{Ref|H&L109}}{{Ref|H&L123}}{{Ref|H&L208}}
