'''House Frey'''{{Ref|GOT607}} of the [[Twins]] is a [[noble house]] from the [[Riverlands]] and a vassal of [[House Tully]]. They were briefly a [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]] after betraying their liege lords at the [[Red Wedding]], but they were eventually subdued once more.

Their ancestral seat is known as the Twins for its two identical keeps on both sides of a river linked by a bridge, sometimes called the Stone Bridge. The Twins is one of the primary crossings over the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]], and tolls from bridge crossings have made the Freys quite wealthy fairly quickly, elevating them from obscurity six centuries ago to being one of the most powerful noble houses in the Riverlands - though they are looked down upon by older aristocratic families. The construction of the Twins took the Freys three centuries, and ever since they have grown wealthy by charging the travelers crossing the Twins.

The current head of the house is unknown following the [[Assassinations at the Twins]] in revenge for the Red Wedding. After the defeat of [[House Lannister]], [[Edmure Tully]] regained control of the Riverlands.

The [[heraldry]] of House Frey represents their castle-seat of the Twins: it consists of two grey towers linked by a bridge, on a darker grey background, over an escutcheon of blue water.<ref name="House Frey viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/frey/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Frey entry]</ref> Their [[house words]] are "We Stand Together."<ref name="E60">"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

==History==
===Background===
House Frey was a noble house in the [[Riverlands]] that had emerged about six hundred years before the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Their seat is at the [[Twins]], a castle consisting of two identical towers and a bridge intersecting the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]] river. The Freys grew rich from exacting tolls on travelers crossing the Green Fork. For most of their history, the Freys have been vassals of [[House Tully]], the [[Lord Paramount of the Trident|paramount lords]] of the Trident since the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] conquest. During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Lord Walder Frey was late in marshaling forces to assist the forces of his liege lord [[Hoster Tully]] during the [[Battle of the Trident]]. For this insolence, Lord Hoster mockingly referred to Lord Frey as the "Late Walder Frey", much to Walder's chagrin.<ref name="House Frey Histories & Lore">"[[House Frey (short)|House Frey]]"</ref>

== Military strength ==
[[File:Frey men season 6.png|thumb|Frey [[Man-at-arms|soldiers]] during the [[second siege of Riverrun]].]]
Due to their wealth from river tolls, the Freys command one of the larger armies among the houses of the Riverlands, between 3,000-4,000 infantry levies and some cavalry.<ref>See the calculation in [[Battle of Whispering Wood#Numbers]].</ref> They are not renowned as particularly experienced warriors or intelligent commanders, however, given that during his long life Lord Walder made sure to keep his house's armies out of actual fighting whenever possible.
Frey soldiers appear to have very poor equipment compared to most of the houses. They almost never wear mail or plate, and don't often carry shields. Frey soldiers often wear punched leather chestpieces, with headgear that usually consists of a leather coif and/or a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervelliere bowl-shaped skullcap]. Rarely, they wear brigandines.

==Current status==
[[Arya Stark|Arya]] killed Lord [[Walder Frey]] in the Season 6 finale, along with his two most prominent sons, Lame [[Lothar Frey]] and Black [[Walder Rivers]]. Lord Walder had several dozen descendants, about a dozen of whom are prominent recurring characters in the novels, but their actions were massively condensed into just these two in the TV version. Lame Lothar was the [[Steward]] of the Twins and his father's right hand, coordinating the day to day activities of the castle; Black Walder Frey and Walder Rivers are two of their prominent army commanders (condensed in the TV version into just one character, "Black Walder Rivers").

In the novels, several characters express their fear that when old Lord Walder eventually dies, it will lead to a fratricidal bloodbath within House Frey, as different internal rivalries play out for who will rule. <span>Before this could break out, Arya, donning Walder Frey's face, gathers all of the lord's sons at the Twins and poisons them, essentially exterminating a house that seemingly had an endless supply of heirs. As the Frey women are unharmed (and presumably any very young Frey men - there are no children shown being poisoned), House Frey is not rendered extinct. Because the full family tree of Walder's more than a hundred descendants is not known in the TV series, the head of House Frey after the assassinations is not known. Per inheritance customs, the lordship of the Crossing passed to the children of the eldest son of Walder's to have children. If the sons of this son of Walder were exterminated by Arya, or if the son did not have any sons, the lordship would have passed to this son's daughters. Going by this, the current head of House Frey could be [[Janeya Frey]], stated in Season 3 to be Walder's eldest granddaughter.</span>

As of the [[Dragonpit]] council shortly after [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]'s death, the title of Lord of Riverrun is again held by [[House Tully]], specifically [[Edmure Tully]], who was freed shortly after Arya's assassinations of the Freys.<ref>Edmure Tully's [http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season-8/episode-6/people/35/edmure-tully entry] in the ''Game of Thrones'' Viewer's Guide (Season 8 Episode 6)</ref>

===Lord Walder's descendants===
During [[Robert's Rebellion]], the jest was made that Lord Walder arrived late to the [[Battle of the Trident]] because he was waiting for his army to come of age, given that he had produced most of his soldiers from within his own britches (directly or indirectly through his previous children). Walder devoted the next seventeen years to making this claim a reality.

[[File:House Frey ASOIAF.svg|thumb|200px|right|The Frey coat of arms in the ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' novels: blue twin towers united by a bridge on silver-grey.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Frey controls the Twins, two castles that hold the Crossing, the only bridge over the [[Green Fork]] of the [[Trident]] for hundreds of miles in either direction. House Frey is the northern-most house of the Riverlands, not far south of the loose border with the [[North]], and has a history of enmity with [[House Reed]], who control the marshes of the [[Neck]] to the north of the Twins.

House Frey was a minor house of no notability until they bridged the Green Fork six centuries ago and defending the bridge with two wooden castles. Charging wayfarers for the use of the Crossing, they grew rich and influential, replacing the castles with strong stone keeps. Their growing wealth and influence saw them gain several vassal houses of their own: House Erenford, House Haigh, and House Charlton. Given the relatively recent rise of their House, the Freys are looked down upon by other noble Houses of the Riverlands as uncouth and honorless.

Their military strength is formidable, allowing them to raise 4,000 soldiers by themselves - almost 10% of the total strength of the Riverlands. The current Lord Frey's father was involved in the scandal of the Whitewalls Tourney, when the Second Blackfyre Rebellion was halted in its tracks, roughly ninety years ago, leading to the current Lord Frey being a cautious man, extremely reluctant to commit himself to any cause until the outcome is certain. During [[Robert's Rebellion]] he delayed the arrival of his army at the [[Battle of the Trident]] until [[Robert Baratheon]] had secured victory. For this, Lord Frey's liege, [[Hoster Tully]], dubbed him "The Late Lord Frey", a nickname which has stuck, to Walder Frey's fury.

The Red Wedding has destroyed what honor is left in the house, as they have violated one of the oldest and most sacred traditions, the guest right. This leads to antipathy and disgust towards the house by most Westerosi, even by their own allies. Moreover, the name Frey has become a synonym for dishonor and treachery.{{Bookref|AFFC|23}}

Little has been revealed about members of House Frey who are not descendants of Lord Walder himself. It is probable that due to his advanced age of ninety years, Walder may have simply outlived any siblings or cousins he may have had. The one minor reference to Walder's family is in the ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' prequel novellas, which take place almost ninety years before the beginning of ''A Game of Thrones''. Walder himself actually makes a brief appearance in the prequels as a misbehaving toddler - making him one of the only characters who are present in both the main series and the prequel novellas; Maester [[Aemon]] is about a decade older than Walder, thus he is also alive during the early prequel novellas, though he does not prominently appear (instead, his younger brother [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Maekar)|Aegon "Egg" Targaryen]] is a major character). Walder's father appears in the prequel but is referred to simply as "Lord Frey" without revealing what his name was. However, the prequels also reveal that Walder actually had a sister, who was about a dozen years older than him, who marries Lord Ambrose of House Butterwell, a noble House from the [[Crownlands]]. Given that the Butterwells are disgraced during the events of the prequels, it isn't clear if they died out between the prequels and the main series - no current Butterwells have been mentioned in the main series. Given the limited information, it isn't clear if Lord Walder has any surviving nieces, nephews, grand-nephews, or distant cousins from cadet branches of the main Frey line.

Despite their prominence in the storyline, the motto of House Frey has not yet been revealed, even in the first five novels.

The [[heraldry]] of House Frey is somewhat different in the books than it is in the TV series. In the books, it is the two towers and bridge of the Twins colored blue, on a silver-grey background. The TV series made the towers stone grey, and over the same dark grey field as in the books, but now above a blue escutcheon which is drawn to resemble the waves of the Green Fork of the Trident. The color change may be because after the blue river was added as an escutcheon at the bottom, it would have been visually confusing to have the castle be the same color as the water. Unfortunately, reversing the colors like this makes it vaguely resemble the reversed colors used in heraldry by [[bastard]] children (though in such cases, without the escutcheon, the entire background field is blue, not just the escutcheon).

Some Freys are named after known members of [[House Targaryen]], among them: Ser Aenys, Lord Frey's third son; his sons Aegon "Bloodborn" and Rhaegar; Aegon "Jinglebell", the [[Halfwit|lackwit]] son of [[Stevron Frey|Stevron]]. These names hardly impress anyone, though; Lord [[Wyman Manderly]] scornfully regards Rhaegar Frey as "''a smirking worm who wears a dragon's name''."{{Bookref|ADWD|29}}
