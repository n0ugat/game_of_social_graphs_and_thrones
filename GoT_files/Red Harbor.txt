'''Red Harbor'''{{Ref|GOT205}} is a harbor town on the [[Iron Islands]]. It serves as the main harbor for the region.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Yara Greyjoy]] berths her fleet of thirty ships off Red Harbor because it is larger than [[Lordsport]].{{Ref|GOT205}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Lordsport is a major port in its own right. There is no mention of Red Harbor although the harbors of most of the other Iron Islands have not been named.
