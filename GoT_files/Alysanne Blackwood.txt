==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Alysanne Blackwood is the tomboyish younger sister of Lord Samwell Blackwood, who after his death fights alongside his successor, her young nephew Benjicot Blackwood. An excellent hunter and horse-breaker, she fought in the Blackwood army as a skilled archer. After Samwell was killed at the Battle of the Burning Mill by Amos Bracken, she personally avenged him by shooting a weirwood arrow through Amos's eye. Afterward she became the loyal aide-de-camp of her nephew "Bloody Ben" in the Blackwood army. 

Alysanne was fierce, fearless, and not at all lady-like, which combined with her skill in combat as an archer earned her the nickname "Black Aly". She had a tall and lean build, and thick curly black hair which when loose was long enough to reach her waist. At the start of the Dance of the Dragons she was sixteen years old, the legal age of adulthood in Westeros.

Aly had a bawdy tongue and claimed she lost her maidenhead from horseriding when she was thirteen, though it is suspected she was lying so as not to admit she had already lost her virginity. It was also rumored she enjoyed the intimate company of both men and women.

Alysanne Blackwood is apparently named after Queen [[Alysanne Targaryen]], as she was such a beloved queen that "Alysanne" became a popular name for young girls born in the generations she ruled (similarly, [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] / "Alys-ent" is a variation on "Alys-anne").
