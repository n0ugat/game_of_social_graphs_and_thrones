==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Alyssa was the fifthborn child of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys]] and [[Alysanne Targaryen|Alysanne]]. She and Baelon had three sons: Viserys, Daemon, and Aegon, the latter dead in infancy.

Alyssa, named after her grandmother [[Alyssa Velaryon]], was born in 60 AC. She was said to resemble her late sister [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Jaehaerys I)|Daenerys]], but as she grew older the resemblance faded. Her tangled hair was dirty blond, her eyes mismatched violet and green. She was skinny and had a long face, big ears, a lopsided smile, and a crooked nose that she had broken at age 6. As a child, she would constantly avoid ladylike activities, preferring to ride horses, climb, and train at arms with wooden swords. She disliked spending time with other girls. She often said that she was "as bawdy a wench as any barmaid in [[King's Landing]]." During her childhood, Alyssa followed her older brother [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]] wherever he went, just as Baelon did with [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Aemon]]. Later, her younger sister [[Maegelle Targaryen|Maegelle]] started clinging to her in the same way.

Alyssa was briefly a candidate to be [[Marriage|married]] to Prince Aemon, but Queen Alysanne refused, having already planned to marry her to Prince Baelon. Alyssa and Baelon were inseparable, and their betrothal was made official in 73 AC. Alyssa once poured a flagon of wine over her brother [[Vaegon Targaryen|Vaegon]]'s head, after he had insulted their sister [[Daella Targaryen|Daella]] to tears. The next year, during a session of sword training, Baelon brought Alyssa to the yard dressed in mail to fight Vaegon. She mocked and humiliated him, dancing around him, and Vaegon threw down his sword and stormed off.

Alyssa was married to Baelon in 75 AC. Reportedly, the wedding guests were greatly amused by the sounds coming from the bedchamber that night. That same year, she entered the [[Dragonpit]] to claim a [[dragon]]. Initially she wanted [[Balerion]] the Black Dread, though the [[Dragonkeepers]] persuaded her that he was too old and slow. She finally claimed [[Meleys]] the Red Queen. Alyssa and Baelon spent most of their time riding their dragons together, and in the bedchamber. Viserys was born to them in 77 AC, and nine days later she took him to the sky on the back of Meleys. A second son, Daemon, was born in 81 AC, who she also flew with.

In 84 AC, Alyssa gave birth to a third son, Aegon. She then told Baelon that she intended to give him twenty sons, "an army of your own." She died six months later at age 24 from complications, and Aegon died shortly before his first [[nameday]]. Baelon refused to take another wife or mistress.
