{{Quote|All hail Bran the Broken, the First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms, and Protector of the Realm.|[[Tyrion Lannister]]|The Iron Throne}}
The '''Six Kingdoms'''{{Ref|GOT806}} is the name given to the realm that controls southern [[Westeros]] and its numerous offshore islands established after a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]]. It is ruled by the elected [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]] from the [[Red Keep]] in the capital city of [[King's Landing]].

The realm was formed from the monarchy of the [[Iron Throne]] that ruled the vast area of Westeros known as the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. The Iron Throne was destroyed by [[Drogon]] in a rage after the [[assassination of Daenerys Targaryen]], and it is unknown if a new throne was constructed for the new monarchy. The name "Six Kingdoms" was coined by [[Tyrion Lannister]] during the aforementioned [[Great Council]], after it was formally agreed upon that the [[North]] would secede from the Red Keep's rule.

The first monarch elected by the Great Council is [[Bran Stark|Bran the Broken]], First of His Name.

==History==
:''Main pages: [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]], [[History]]
[[Westeros]] was once made up of seven independent kingdoms that were united by force into a single realm, the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. The kingdoms were united by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]], his sister-wives [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]], and their [[dragon]]s in a [[Aegon's Conquest|campaign]] that led to the defeat of the [[Great House]]s and the rise of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]]. The only exception was [[Dorne]], but [[House Martell]] later pledged [[Dorne]] to the [[Iron Throne]] through a marital alliance. The Targaryens enforced their reign from [[King's Landing]] through their dragons, but they were heavily weakened in the [[Dance of the Dragons]], and their dragons, the last in the [[known world]], eventually went extinct.

The last Targaryen [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]], Mad King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], was overthrown in a [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] led by [[Lordship|Lords]] [[Robert Baratheon]], [[Eddard Stark]], and [[Jon Arryn]]. Aerys and his eldest son, [[Prince of Dragonstone|Prince]] [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], were killed, while his younger children, [[Viserys Targaryen|Viserys]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen]], were smuggled across the [[Narrow Sea]] to [[Essos]]. Robert became the new king on the Iron Throne, but the death of his betrothed, Eddard's sister [[Lyanna Stark]], apparently at Rhaegar's hand, caused him to instead marry [[Cersei Lannister]], the daughter of Lord [[Tywin Lannister]], to keep the realm united.

The death of King Robert led to another civil war known as the [[War of the Five Kings]], which destabilized the realm and left much of Westeros divided and in ruins. With her dragons reborn, Daenerys Targaryen launched her own [[Last War|campaign]] to take back the Iron Throne, which had since been seized by Queen Cersei Lannister, while the ancient and long-forgotten [[White Walkers]] rose again in the [[Beyond the Wall|far north]], amassing an [[Wights|Army of the Dead]] to kill the living. Daenerys put her campaign on hold to aid the [[North]] in destroying the White Walkers, ending the [[Great War]]. However, the [[Battle of Winterfell|battle]] depleted her forces while strengthening Cersei's own, and Daenerys suffered further losses in her resumed campaign against Cersei. Driven to [[Targaryen madness|madness]], Daenerys [[Battle of King's Landing|burned down King's Landing]], leading to her [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassination]] by [[Jon Snow]] in a plot devised by [[Tyrion Lannister]].

With the Iron Throne and King's Landing burnt to the ground, the surviving lords and ladies gathered in a [[Great Council in the Dragonpit]] to discuss the future of the realm. In an attempt to end the cycle of violence, they instituted an elective monarchy, as opposed to the previous hereditary monarchy, and chose [[Bran Stark]] as their new king, as proposed by Tyrion Lannister. Daenerys' forces agreed to withdraw from Westeros, while Jon Snow was sent back to the [[Night's Watch]] in [[exile]]. [[Sansa Stark]] was able to secure independence for the [[North|Kingdom of the North]] after persuading King Bran, becoming the [[King in the North|Queen in the North]]. As a result of the regime and geopolitical changes, the Seven Kingdoms became the Six Kingdoms.

==Government==
{{Main|Lordship}}
Whereas the Seven Kingdoms were ruled as a hereditary absolute monarchy, the Six Kingdoms are an [[Elections|elective]] monarchy. The elected [[king]] or queen rules for life. After or nearing the sovereign's death or abdication, the [[Great Council]] names a successor. The sovereign's head of government is the [[Hand of the King|Hand]], who may assume the full responsibilites of the sovereign, and even claim the sovereign's title of "[[Protector of the Realm]]," should he or she be absent or incapacitated.

The central government of the realm is the [[Small Council]], a chamber of lords that advise the sovereign and/or the Hand in matters such as economy, intelligence, or law. The permanent Small Council positions and their current occupants are:

* The [[Master of Laws]]: ''vacant''
* The [[Master of Coin]]: [[Bronn]], [[Lord of Highgarden]]
* The [[Master of Ships]]: Lord [[Davos Seaworth]]
* The [[Master of War]]: ''vacant''
* The [[Master of Whisperers]]: ''vacant''
* The [[Grand Maester]]: [[Samwell Tarly|Samwell]]
* The [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]]: Ser [[Brienne of Tarth]]

The sovereign may appoint other advisors to the council at his or her discretion, but they hold no official office (they operate "[[Wikipedia:Minister without portfolio|without portfolio]]").

===Administrative regions===
Beneath the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]], the Hand of the King, and the Small Council, but still enjoying a great degree of autonomy, are the rulers of the administrative regions of the Six Kingdoms. They are almost all referred to as [[Lord Paramount|Lords Paramount]] of their respective region, with the only two exceptions being [[Dorne]], the ruler being referred to as the [[Prince of Dorne]], and the [[Iron Islands]], the ruler being referred to as the [[Lord of the Iron Islands]]. The Lords Paramount are the paternal heads of the [[Great House]]s; each Great House rules a region.

Additionally, some lords may be named as [[Warden]]s, who are regional commanders sworn to defend the realm from threats posed in and around their region. The three Wardens are the Warden of the West, the Warden of the East, and the Warden of the South (the position of Warden of the North was abolished when the independent [[North|Kingdom of the North]] was established). Wardens are traditionally rulers of administrative regions, but this is not always the case. If such a lord is in his minority, someone else may temporarily be named Warden.

Below the Lords Paramount lie their [[Noble house|vassals]]: lords and landed knights who rule in the name of their liege lord and are sworn to answer their summons when the need arises. These lords may, in turn, have their own vassals and sworn knights ruling over portions of their own lands. The lowest in the social ladder are the [[smallfolk]], or commoners, who make up the majority of the population. Most smallfolk are serfs, legally bound to work for their lord in exchange for the privilege of land and home.

The following table goes in descending order from north to south of [[Westeros]].

Additionally, in the [[North]], the [[Wall]] and the [[Gift]] are directly controlled by the [[Night's Watch]] and its [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]]. The Night's Watch is sworn to remain neutral in the conflicts involving the realm. It is not known whether the Gift is part of the Six Kingdoms or the Kingdom of the North, or whether the two realms share jurisdiction of the region.

As the [[Riverlands]] were under [[Ironborn]] rule during [[Aegon's Conquest]], they do not count as one of the "Six Kingdoms." Similarly, the [[Crownlands]] were formed from lands that were divided between the Ironborn and [[Stormlands|Stormlander]] kingdoms at that time, and as such are not a kingdom either.

==Justice==
{{Main|Seven Kingdoms#Justice}}
The legal system of the Six Kingdoms is presumably as it was during the age of the Seven Kingdoms. As demonstrated by [[Jon Snow]]'s [[exile]], criminals may still be sent to the [[Wall]] to serve in the [[Night's Watch]], despite the current lack of a threat from the [[Free Folk]] or [[White Walkers]]. Matters of law and justice are still handled by the Master of Laws on the Small Council.

==Economy and currency==
{{Main|Seven Kingdoms#Economy and currency}}
It is unknown whether the Six Kingdoms underwent an economic reform or kept the system of the Seven Kingdoms.

==Military==
{{Main|Seven Kingdoms#Military}}
With the creation of the office of Master of War, the military force of the Six Kingdoms may be more centralized than it was during the age of the Seven Kingdoms. The idea of a standing "royal army" was previously entertained by [[Robert Baratheon]] as well as his successor [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], though neither did anything to bring this idea to fruition. The position of "Master of War" was first conceived by [[Cersei Lannister]], adopted by [[Daenerys Targaryen]], and later formally created by King Bran.

The [[royal fleet]], stationed in [[Blackwater Bay]], is commanded by the [[Master of Ships]]. Other navies serving the crown include the [[Iron Fleet]] in the [[Iron Islands]] and the [[Redwyne fleet]] in the [[Redwyne Straits]].

After the reformation, supreme military authority in the South was transferred from the [[Lord of Highgarden]] to the [[Lord of Storm's End]], presently [[Gendry Baratheon]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Laws and customs}}
The mainland of the Six Kingdoms is predominantly populated by the [[Andals]], who originally [[Coming of the Andals|came to Westeros]] from the hills of [[Andalos]] in [[Essos]]. The Andals uphold a fierce tradition of [[knighthood]], chivalry, and feudalism.

[[Dornishmen]] are most widespread in the administrative region of [[Dorne]], located on the southern mainland. The Dornishmen are the descendants of [[First Men]] and [[Rhoynar]] who united into one people when Princess [[Nymeria]] of [[Ny Sar]] conquered the region's many petty kingdoms after fleeing from Essos due to having lost a war against the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. Culturally the Dornishmen are similar to the Andals, but have a much more liberal view on sexuality, gender equality, and [[bastard]]y.

The [[Iron Islands]] are inhabited by the [[Ironborn]], a culture of sailors and pirates. It is rooted deep within the Ironborn tradition to seize by force what they consider necessary: "paying the [[iron price]]."—though there have been efforts by the current [[Lord of the Iron Islands|Lady of the Iron Islands]], [[Yara Greyjoy]], to phase out this so-called [[Old Way]]. This has been attempted since the Iron Islands were brought into the Seven Kingdoms, and has always failed in the long term.

Among the noble houses of the Six Kingdoms, there are very few who still follow the customs of the [[First Men]], [[House Blackwood]] of [[Raventree Hall]] among them. These houses reject the concept of knighthood, and worship the [[Old Gods]]. Out of respect for these houses, many Andal houses have [[godswood]]s in their castles.

The rarest race of men in Westeros are the [[Valyrians]]. Most of those with more-or-less pure Valyrian blood in the Six Kingdoms are remnants of the old Valyrian Freehold who either colonized part of the continent or fled the [[Doom of Valyria]]. The known Valyrian houses are the [[House Celtigar|Celtigars]] and [[House Velaryon|Velaryons]], while the last known scion of [[House Targaryen]], [[Jon Snow]], is [[exile]]d to the [[Night's Watch]] and was last seen [[Beyond the Wall|north]] of the [[Wall]] (and is in truth a [[Northmen|Northman]] culturally). Additional Valyrian houses in Westeros that are now extinct include [[House Blackfyre]] and [[House Qoherys]]. Valyrian families often speak the [[High Valyrian]] language amongst themselves, while also being fluent in the [[Common Tongue]] of the Andals as a second language. They are said to possess the blood of the [[dragon]], and have historically been known to [[Dragonrider|ride]] dragons.

==Major religions==
{{Main|Religion}}
The dominant religion in the Six Kingdoms is the [[Faith of the Seven]], upheld primarily by Andals and Dornishmen and originally brought to Westeros during the [[coming of the Andals]]. Although it is said that followers of this religion worship seven gods, it is actually [[Seven|one god]] consisting of seven aspects: the Father, the Smith, the Warrior, the Mother, the Maiden, the Crone, and the Stranger. Some refer to this deity as the "Seven-Faced God" to avoid confusion. The Faith is highly organized, led by the [[High Septon]] from the [[Starry Sept]] in [[Oldtown]]. The male and female clergy respectively are the [[septon]]s and [[septa]]s.

Unorganized and less common, the worship of the [[Old Gods]] is practiced mostly by noble families who still follow the customs of the First Men. Highly personal and spiritual, this religion has no clergy or sacred texts, and prayer is done before a [[weirwood]] tree in a [[godswood]]. The Old Gods were originally worshiped by the [[Children of the Forest]] and the [[giants]] who once dominated the continent. The gods were adopted by the First Men after a [[War of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|long period of war]] against the Children, which ended with the peace treaty known as the [[Pact]].

The Ironborn of the Iron Islands revere the [[Drowned God]], a harsh sea deity who favors and rewards those who undertake war and plunder in his name, and whose enemy is the [[Storm God]]. The Drowned God's clergy are called the [[Drowned Men]], who are initiated by being literally drowned and revived. The Drowned God is unrecognized on the mainland; when mainlanders swear sacred oaths, they swear "by the Old Gods and the new" without mention of the Drowned God.

Some in the Six Kingdoms worship the fire god known as the [[Lord of Light]]. This deity is popular in [[Essos]], where [[Red priest|red priests and priestesses]] roam the land to preach His word. The enemy of the Lord of Light is the [[Great Other]], the god of darkness, cold, and death. While worship of the Lord of Light most commonly includes lighting fires and praying, the clergy and the most devout of the faith perform human sacrifices by burning. Until recently the religion has failed to gain a following in Westeros, but the conversions of [[Stannis Baratheon]] and the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] have made the worship of the Lord of Light slightly more widespread. It is unknown if former followers of Stannis still worship the Lord of Light or if they have returned to the Faith of the Seven.
