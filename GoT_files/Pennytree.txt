'''Pennytree'''{{Ref|GOT806}} is a settlement in the [[Riverlands]], the region controlled by [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. It is located northeast of Riverrun, in between [[Stone Hedge]], seat of [[House Bracken]] and [[Raventree Hall]], seat of [[House Blackwood]]. Ser [[Arlan of Pennytree]] hailed from this village.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Pennytree lies in the frontline of frequent border disputes between the Blackwoods and Brackens and possession of the town has changed a lot over the centuries. It is named for a huge old oak tree, to which hundreds of copper pennies have been nailed. It has a holdfast as strong as any in the riverlands, with thick stone walls twelve feet high.

[[Duncan the Tall]], as a young boy born in [[Flea Bottom]], once squired for a hedge knight called Ser Arlan, hailing from Pennytree.

In the fifth novel, on the way back from [[Raventree Hall]], Jaime and his troops stop at Pennytree. He notes that Pennytree has been burned in the War of the Five Kings, but most of its houses have since been rebuilt. The inhabitants hide at the stronghold, fearing that the troops arrive to raid the village, as happened more than once. Jaime tells them he does not mean harm, but they do not believe him. One of his knights suggests to break into the stronghold or burn it down, but Jaime refuses to harm people for no reason.{{Bookref|ADWD|48}}
