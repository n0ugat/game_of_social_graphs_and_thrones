===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
Crew members of the ''Valyrian'' rescue Davos from the [[spears of the merling king]] and take him aboard.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the ''Valyrian'' is a war galley of three hundred oars. 

The ship survives the Battle of the Blackwater because Ser [[Imry Florent]], the Lord High Captain in command of Stannis's fleet, keeps Salladhor and thirty Lyseni galleys as rearguard out in [[Blackwater Bay]]. The ''Valyrian'' and the rest of Saan's ships are among the few that survive the battle, as they are way behind the chain set up by [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to trap Stannis fleet at the mouth [[Blackwater Rush]] and destroy it with wildfire. Saan's fleet rescues Stannis and several of his surviving loyalists, mostly [[House Florent|Florents]].

Following the battle, the ''Valyrian'' remains anchored at Dragonstone, though Salladhor's ships intercept any trade ships crossing Blackwater Bay and "tax" them on their goods, as Saan has been made Lord of Blackwater Bay by Alester Florent. Davos is rescued by the crew of Khorane Sathmantes, the Lysene captain of ''Shayala's Dance'', a galley of Salladhor's fleet.

After Stannis decides to lend aid to the Night's Watch, the ''Valyrian'' sets sail towards [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]].

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', Salladhor and his fleet set sail from Eastwatch for the [[White Harbor]], to take Davos as an envoy from Stannis to Lord [[Wyman Manderly]]. As a show of strength, Davos is supposed to arrive on the great ''Valyrian'', with the rest of the splendid fleet behind her. However, much of Salladhor's fleet is destroyed on the way by storms. It is not mentioned whether the ''Valyrian'' is among the destroyed ships.
