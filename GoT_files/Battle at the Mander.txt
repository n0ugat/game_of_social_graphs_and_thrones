A '''battle''' occurred at the mouth of the [[Mander]] between [[House Greyjoy]] and [[House Tyrell]] in the final days of [[Robert's Rebellion]].<ref name="Greyjoy">"[[The Greyjoy Rebellion]]"</ref>

==History==
===Prelude===
After the [[Battle of the Trident]], [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] and [[Euron Greyjoy]] convinced their old father [[Quellon Greyjoy]] to join [[Robert's Rebellion]] and attack the [[Reach]].<ref name="Greyjoy"/>

===Battle===
The Greyjoy fleet unexpectedly met Tyrell longboats at the mouth of the river Mander. Lord Quellon died in the fighting, making his son Balon the new [[Lord of the Iron Islands]]. Balon ordered a tactical retreat, and thus the Greyjoy participation in Robert's Rebellion ended.<ref name="Greyjoy"/>

===Aftermath===
After his defeat, Balon returned to the [[Iron Islands]] to sit the [[Salt Throne]]. Against his brother Euron's advice, Balon [[Greyjoy Rebellion|declared war]] on the [[Iron Throne]] yet again.<ref name="Greyjoy"/>

==In the books==
The battle is not mentioned in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels. According to ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Quellon Greyjoy led fifty longships against the Reach. At the mouth of the Mander, they were surprised by the longboats of the [[Shield Islands]], and Quellon was killed. The [[ironborn]] eventually won the battle, but Balon retreated back to [[Pyke]] nonetheless.
