{{Quote|Long ago, when the [[Night's Watch]] was at full strength, the builders would quarry blocks of ice from the frozen lakes of the Haunted Forest, dragging them south on sledges to add to the [[Wall]].|[[Samwell Tarly]]|The Wall}}
The '''Haunted Forest'''{{Ref|H&L409}} is a substantial woodland lying [[Beyond the Wall|north]] of the [[Wall]], beyond the northern border of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. The forest extends for several hundred miles to the north, from Castle Black along the foothills of the mountain range known as the [[Frostfangs]] to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, before dying out in the subarctic wastelands of the [[Land of Always Winter]].

The forest is inhabited by tribes of [[Free Folk|wildlings]] who sometimes use the cover of the forest to approach the Wall and try to scale it to raid the lands to the south. The [[Night's Watch]] tries to keep the forest clear of the Wall itself, but only have the manpower to clear the woods immediately to the north of [[Castle Black]] and their other manned castles.

[[Craster's Keep]] and [[White Tree]] are located within the Haunted Forest. The [[Fist of the First Men]] is located beyond its limits.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Haunted Forest has a fell reputation. The Night's Watch sends patrols into it to scout for signs of wildling activity. [[Weirwood]] trees still grow in the wild in the Haunted Forest, unlike anywhere else on the continent.

The [[Fist of the First Men]] is located near the haunted forest at its borders.
