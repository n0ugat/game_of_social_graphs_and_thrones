'''House Lothston'''{{Ref|H&L214}}{{Note|The Mad Lady's surname is Lothston.}} of [[Harrenhal]] is an extinct noble house of the [[Riverlands]]. Their sigil was a black bat on a field divided bendwise, silver and gold.

Their seat was the castle of Harrenhal, which was granted to them after the extinction of [[House Strong]]. However, the Lothstons also died out, like all the Houses to hold Harrenhal, and the castle was passed on to [[House Whent]].

One of the members of House Lothston is the stuff of tales. Lady [[Danelle Lothston]], also known as "Mad Lady Lothston", who was said to send a giant bat to capture children for her cookpots, to bathe in blood, and serve [[cannibalism|feasts of human flesh]].<ref>"[[Harrenhal (short)|Harrenhal]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Lothston's backstory is the same. They are considered an ill-omened house, and their sigil is reviled in several places. Descendants of the Lothstons still live in exile in the [[Free Cities]].

Only one person whose last name is Lothston appears in the novels - Jon Lothston, a high-ranking officer of the [[Golden Company]]; it is uncertain whether he actually belongs to this house, since in the free companies a man can call himself whatever he chooses.

The Lothstons held Harrenhal during the time of the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]].

In ''A Storm of Swords'', [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] finds an old shield in the armory of [[Harrenhal]], whose chipped paint still shows most of the great black bat of House Lothston. Since the Lothstons died ages ago, Jaime figures that no one is likely to object to him bearing their arms. Later he gives the shield to [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]].

In ''A Feast for Crows'', while Brienne travels in the [[Riverlands]], the bat sigil on her shield draws unpleasant comments from people whom she encounters, due to the negative reputation of the Lothstons; therefore, Brienne has the shield repainted.
