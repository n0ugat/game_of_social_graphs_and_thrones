'''Seasmoke'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Embrōrbar''}} is a [[dragon]] bred by [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]]. He was ridden by [[Laenor Velaryon]] and later by his [[bastard]] half-brother, [[Addam of Hull]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Seasmoke is a pale, silver-grey dragon with light green eyes. By the time of the [[War for the Stepstones]], he is still young, but nevertheless a nimble flyer in the sky.{{Guideref|Seasmoke}}

Laenor rides Seasmoke in battle during the War for the [[Stepstones]]. He proves crucial in winning the [[siege of Bloodstone]], saving [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] after he is wounded and surrounded by [[Triarchy]] soldiers.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

Laenor rides Seasmoke towards [[King's Landing]] on the day he is to marry [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]. His mother Rhaenys rides the dragon [[Meleys]] at his side.{{Ref|HOTD105}}[[File:WLTW Seasmoke & Meleys.png|thumb|Flying to King's Landing for the royal wedding.]]Seasmoke stays at [[High Tide]] along with several other dragons during the funeral of [[Laena Velaryon]]. After Laenor fakes his own death and goes into [[exile]],{{Ref|HOTD107}} Seasmoke is left riderless and continues to reside on [[Driftmark]].{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[File:S2 Addam and Seasmoke.png|thumb|left|250px|Addam of Hull observes Seasmoke roaming Driftmark.]]
Seasmoke nearly devoured [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] when she tried to claim him.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

Addam witnesses Seasmoke soaring around Driftmark while foraging for crabs on the shores.{{Ref|HOTD202}}

Rhaenyra and [[Mysaria]] witness Seasmoke flying around [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]]. Rhaenyra tells Mysaria that the dragon has lately grown restless for unknown reasons.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

Seasmoke is drawn to the Dragonstone gantry upon hearing [[Dragonkeepers]] singing the [[dragonsong]] "''[[Hāros Bartossi]]''." Ser [[Steffon Darklyn]] attempts to claim Seasmoke as his mount after learning of his [[House Targaryen|Targaryen ancestry]], but Seasmoke rejects Steffon by burning him and one Dragonkeeper before flying to Driftmark. Seasmoke then pursues and corners Addam against a rock in a forest, for the dragon had chosen him as his rider.{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Seasmoke and [[Syrax]] call to each other as Addam and [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] converse before flying back to Dragonstone together.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

Seasmoke and Syrax fly Addam and Rhaenyra to Harrenhal, where the lords of the [[Riverlands]] swear fealty to her.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Seasmoke was the name given by Laenor Velaryon to the dragon hatched to him. He was grey and white in color.

Seasmoke was of fighting size during the Dance, but still a young dragon and nimbler in the air than his older brothers. He was of comparable size to [[Tessarion]], who was about three times smaller than [[Vermithor]], and not as fearsome a beast as him in comparison.

There is no mention that Seasmoke or Laenor participated in the War for the Stepstones.
