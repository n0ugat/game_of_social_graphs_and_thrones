==On ''Game of Thrones''==
Rosabell had not read any of the books or watched the TV show of ''Game of Thrones'' before she was cast - unlike [[Keisha Castle-Hughes]] (Obara Sand) who had read the books ''before'' the TV series started, and [[Jessica Henwick]] (Nymeria Sand), who watched the TV series and read through the first two books by Season 5.<ref>http://www.ew.com/article/2015/05/28/game-thrones-sand-snakes</ref>

Sellers was living in Rome when she auditioned on tape for the role of Tyene. As she said, "A few weeks later, I was in London for drama school auditions, and it happened to be when [[David Benioff|David]] and [[D.B. Weiss|Dan]] were there, so [[Nina Gold]] organized a second audition with them, and it went well."<ref>http://nypost.com/2015/04/06/meet-the-newest-badass-beauties-of-game-of-thrones/</ref>

She is now attending the Guildhall School of Music & Drama in London.<ref>http://nypost.com/2015/04/06/meet-the-newest-badass-beauties-of-game-of-thrones/</ref>
