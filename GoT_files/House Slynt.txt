'''House Slynt'''{{Ref|GOT108}}{{Note|Janos's surname is Slynt.}} is a former [[noble house]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. It held fealty directly to King [[Joffrey Baratheon]], who ordered the founding of the house as a reward for [[Janos Slynt]]'s assistance against [[Eddard Stark]], who desired to place [[Stannis Baratheon]] upon the [[Iron Throne]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Slynt is founded as a reward for Janos Slynt's assistance in arresting Eddard Stark. Janos takes for his sigil a bloody spear, gold on a night-black field.

[[Tywin Lannister]] ridicules both Slynt's ascension to lordship, and his choice of sigil when he hears of it, commenting that a "bloody meat cleaver would be more appropriate", given the fact that Slynt himself was the lowborn son of a butcher. At Tywin's order, Tyrion dismisses Janos when he arrives in the capital, exiling him to the Night's Watch and stripping his family of Harrenhal - which he never actually set foot in. Tyrion felt Janos wasn't trustworthy enough to keep around the royal court, but he did allow Janos's children to keep their recently ennobled status. "House Slynt" therefore continued to nominally exist, but possessed no lands. Tyrion said that he would try to find lesser lands for Janos's sons to hold but it is unclear if he ever did. Otherwise, Janos's sons continue to appear as hangers-on at the royal court.
