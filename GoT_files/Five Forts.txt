The '''Five Forts'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} are a series of fortresses on the northeastern border of [[Yi Ti]].{{Note|Marked by five spears on [[:File:HotD Jade Gates Map.jpg|Corlys Velaryon's map of his voyages]].}}

==In the books==
In ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', the Five Forts are massive fortresses of [[black stone]] that were supposedly built by the Pearl Emperor of the Great Empire of the Dawn to defend the world of Men from the wrath of the [[Lion of Night]]. Some believe that the [[Valyrians]] built the Forts, however, but there is no evidence to suggest this other than the fact that they are made of fused stone, similarly to the [[Dragonstone (material)|dragonstone]] used by the [[Valyrian Freehold|Freehold]]. In modern times, it is used to guard Yi Ti from raiders in the Grey Waste, much like how the [[Wall]] of [[Westeros]] is now used to guard the [[Seven Kingdoms]] against the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] to the [[Beyond the Wall|north]].
