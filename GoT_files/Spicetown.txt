'''Spicetown'''{{Ref|HOTD102}} is a major port town on the coast of [[Driftmark]]. It is connected by a causeway to the castle [[High Tide]].{{Ref|HOTD105}}{{Ref|HOTD107}}

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
[[Laena Velaryon]] tells [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] that the workers at Spicetown sometimes hear [[Vhagar]], who has made nest nearby after the death of her [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|last rider]].{{Ref|HOTD102}}

During their visit to High Tide, Viserys and [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] land at Spicetown and proceed to the castle on the causeway.{{Ref|HOTD105}}

Spicetown is visible in the distance when [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] flies Vhagar for the first time.{{Ref|HOTD107}}[[File:2x1 Corlys Velaryon Still 4.jpg|thumb|Lord Corlys overseeing repairs to his fleet.]][[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] meets with [[Qarl Correy]] in Spicetown to plot [[Laenor Velaryon]]'s false death.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
The ''[[Queen Who Never Was|Sea Snake]]'', flagship of the [[Velaryon fleet]], is undergoing repairs in Spicetown after sustaining heavy damage in the [[War for the Stepstones]].{{Ref|HOTD201}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Spicetown was once a small fishing village, but as Lord Corlys's wealth drastically increased the prosperity of Driftmark, it grew into a large market town and port, located in the shadow of High Tide castle itself. Much of the [[Velaryon fleet]] is anchored there, and at another market town called [[Hull]] on the other side of the island.
