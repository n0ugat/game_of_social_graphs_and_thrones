{{Quote|Ours Is The Fury.

'''House Baratheon'''{{Ref|GOT101}} of [[Storm's End]] is a [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]] that traditionally rules the [[Stormlands]] on the eastern coast of Westeros, aptly named for its frequent storms.

House Baratheon became the royal house of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] (as [[House Baratheon of King's Landing]]) after [[Robert Baratheon]] led a [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] against the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]]. At the end of the rebellion, Robert ascended the Iron Throne as Robert I and married [[Cersei Lannister]] after the death of [[Lyanna Stark]].

House Baratheon became officially extinct after the deaths of [[Stannis Baratheon]] and his [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone|family]], but was revived when Robert's last known [[bastard]] was [[Legitimization|legitimized]] by [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen]] [[Daenerys Targaryen]] as [[Gendry Baratheon]].

House Baratheon's sigil is a crowned black stag on a gold field and their [[house words]] are "Ours is the Fury."<ref>"[[House Baratheon (short)|House Baratheon]]"</ref><ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref>

==History==
===Background===
[[File:Orys Baratheon leadering his troops in Storm's End.png|thumb|Orys Baratheon leading his troops in Storm's End.]]
[[File:House Baratheon lineage.jpg|thumb|A history book with information on the early members of House Baratheon.]]
House Baratheon was founded by [[Orys Baratheon]], a general in the army of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon I Targaryen]], the founder of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] who [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered]] the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Orys Baratheon was also rumored to be Aegon's [[bastard]] half-brother. He defeated [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac the Arrogant]], the last of the [[Storm King]]s, and captured his castle of [[Storm's End]]. For his accomplishments, Orys was made [[Lord of Storm's End]] and founded House Baratheon. Orys took the sigil and words of the defeated [[House Durrandon]] as his own, cementing his [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands|rule]] over the [[Stormlands]] by marrying [[Argella Baratheon|Argella Durrandon]], the daughter of the fallen Argilac.

[[File:H&L121.png|thumb|Robert Baratheon on the Iron Throne.]]
[[Robert Baratheon]] led a [[Robert's Rebellion|rebellion]] against King [[Aerys II Targaryen]], resulting in the overthrowing of the Targaryens. Robert became the new king; [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]] became [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]], ruling the Stormlands from Storm's End; [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] formed the cadet branch [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone]].

Note: Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen are claimed to be the children of King Robert Baratheon, but actually were born of incest between Queen Cersei and her twin brother, Ser [[Jaime Lannister]]. Thus, Stannis was Robert's lawful heir before his death. With the deaths of Stannis and Shireen, the bloodline of House Baratheon became legally extinct (Lord Gendry Baratheon was an unacknowledged bastard of Robert Baratheon and thus was not entitled to claim the Baratheon name). With the death of Tommen, the people of Westeros believed that House Baratheon was completely extinct until Daenerys Targaryen's legitimization of Lord Gendry.

==Military strength==
[[File:Baratheon man-at-arms.jpg|thumb|House Baratheon troops at the Blackwater.]]
House Baratheon men-at-arms are equipped with long padded beige gambesons and nasal helmets with stag crests, and they carry triangular shields. Other men-at-arms have kettle steel helmets instead of nasal helmets, and some are often seen wearing pauldrons and gorgets as well. 

Wealthier Baratheon soldiers, or knights from the Stormlands in general, equip themselves with plate armor parts and helmets with brims and cheek guards. Renly himself, while campaigning, wears a much more expensive version of this armor, with the addition of a brigandine cuirass. Baratheon soldiers from Dragonstone, in contrast, protect themselves with grey mail and plate armor alongside tear drop shields; their grey helmets, however, are similar to those of the Stormlanders. 

Stormlanders are known for being brave and hardy warriors, as exemplified by the Baratheons. In [[Robert's Rebellion]] and [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], House Baratheon plays an incredibly significant part, since in both wars Robert Baratheon is leading his side to victory.<ref>"[[Robert's Rebellion - House Baratheon]]"</ref><ref>"[[Greyjoy Rebellion - Robb Stark]]"</ref><ref>"[[Greyjoy Rebellion - Theon Greyjoy]]"</ref><ref>"[[Greyjoy Rebellion - Stannis Baratheon]]"</ref>

In the beginning of the [[War of the Five Kings]], Renly assembles troops of both the Stormlands and the Reach, a total of about 100,000 men.<ref>"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]"</ref> After his assassination, many of the Stormlords and at least two houses of the Reach ([[House Florent]] and [[House Fossoway]]) join Stannis.<ref>"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"</ref> Stannis's forces number at least 10,000 before the Battle of the Blackwater,<ref>See the calculation in "[[Battle of the Blackwater#Numbers]]".</ref> and there are presumably more troops, left to guard Stannis's castles while most of his troops attack the capital, resulting in the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].

==Family tree==
{{Baratheon tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Orys Baratheon was the rumored bastard half-brother of King [[Aegon I Targaryen]], the conqueror of the Seven Kingdoms. Orys led an army which slew the last of the Storm Kings, Argilac the Arrogant, and captured his castle of Storm's End. For his loyal service, Orys was made a lord and allowed to found his own Great House, marrying the daughter of Argilac and taking his sigil and words for his own. At just under 300 years, this makes House Baratheon the youngest by far of the Great Houses.

House Baratheon has ruled over the tempest-wracked southeastern shores of Westeros, the area known as the Stormlands, ever since. It has produced a number of great and notable warriors, such as Ser Lyonel Baratheon, the Laughing Storm, and married into the royal [[House Targaryen]] several generations ago.

When Robert Baratheon's betrothed, Lyanna Stark, was kidnapped by Rhaegar Targaryen, he was enraged and raised his banners in rebellion against King Aerys II, along with Lyanna's brother (and Robert's best friend) Eddard Stark. They were joined by several other houses in a civil war known as Robert's Rebellion. Robert's army smashed the royal host at the Battle of the Trident and put it to rout. The treachery of House Lannister delivered the capital at King's Landing to Robert. With Lyanna killed during the war, Robert agreed to marry Cersei Lannister in gratitude for her father's pledge of fealty.

Robert became King and gave his brother Stannis (one year younger than him) Dragonstone, the ancestral island stronghold of the Targaryens, and his youngest brother Renly (fifteen years younger) the familial seat at Storm's End.

In a very minor difference to the books, after crowning himself King, Renly doesn't alter the colors of the Baratheon sigil. However, he wears a golden stag on green, though not as an official personal sigil.

Following the death of Robert and Renly, the only surviving members of House Baratheon are Stannis, his wife, and his daughter Shireen. No mention has been made in the five current novels of any surviving cousins, who might make claim to rule of House Baratheon. Robert is rumored to have fathered over a dozen bastards, but they are not considered legitimate heirs. Robert does have one acknowledged bastard, Edric Storm, whom he acknowledged because his mother was a member of the nobility. Robert had no part in raising him, instead sending him to foster at Storm's End.

In the TV series, their banner depicts a stag with a crown around its neck, while in the novels, the crown is above its head. A widespread fan assumption for some time was that because the Baratheons were not kings like the Durrandons had been, they stopped using a crown on their stag sigil, and just used a plain stag for the next three centuries - and only recently re-added a crown to the stag, after Robert's Rebellion when Robert overthrew the Targaryen kings. However, when the Baratheons make appearances during the [[Dunk & Egg novellas]] (particularly Lyonel Baratheon), they are consistently described as used a crowned stag, even though the Targaryens are still the royal family and they are not. Asked about this in 2015, Elio Garcia (owner of Westeros.org) stated that according to materials that George R.R. Martin sent him when co-writing the ''The World of Ice & Fire'' sourcebook, the Baratheons indeed always used a crowned stag sigil, starting from when Orys founded House Baratheon and exactly copied the Durrandon heraldry, through Robert's Rebellion.<ref>https://twitter.com/westerosorg/status/681403646752481280</ref>

The TV series, however, contradicted this in Season 1's "[[The Wolf and the Lion]]": when Bran is asked by Maester [[Luwin]] about the heraldry of the Great Houses, he explicitly says that the Baratheon stag only has a crown ''now'', after Robert became the king. It isn't clear if this was a deliberate change for the TV continuity, or more probably, if the TV scriptwriters also made the common mistake of assuming the Baratheons didn't use a crowned stag before Robert seized the Iron Throne.

Houses sworn to House Baratheon in the books, yet to appear in the series:
*House Buckler of [[Bronzegate]]
*House Cafferen of Fawnton
*House Fell of [[Felwood]]
*House Mertyns of [[Mistwood]]
*House Penrose of Parchments

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Baratheon" is pronounced "Buh-RATH-ee-un".
