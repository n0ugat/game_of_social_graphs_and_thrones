'''Godswoods'''{{Ref|GOT102}} are wooded sanctuaries, enclosed within a castle's walls, that have been set aside as places of worship and meditation dedicated to the [[Old Gods]]. They are centered around a single [[heart tree]], usually a [[weirwood]] tree with a face carved into the trunk.

One such godswood is located in [[Winterfell]].{{Ref|GOT101}} The [[Red Keep]] also has a godswood,{{Ref|GOT401}} as does the ruined castle of [[Harrenhal]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}

==In the books==
It is said that each castle in the [[North]] has a godswood inside its walls.

Before the [[coming of the Andals]], all of the castles of the [[First Men]] in southern Westeros had godswoods in them. After the [[Andals]] conquered the south they took over many of these castles, a large number of which are still standing today (particularly in prominent regional capitals such as [[Riverrun]], [[Casterly Rock]], [[Storm's End]], and [[Highgarden]], to name a few). While the Andals replaced the worship of the old gods with their Faith of the Seven, most of them kept the godswoods in these ancient castles (possibly because outright destroying them would have greatly angered the First Men they had conquered). To this day, there are still godswoods in southern castles such as Riverrun or Highgarden, but they have been converted into secular gardens instead of active religious centers. Even [[King's Landing]] has a godswood. The only godswoods still in active religious use are those in the North (such as at Winterfell), or the handful of noble families in the south that still worship the old gods, such as [[House Blackwood]] in the Riverlands.

When [[Stannis Baratheon]] converts to the religion of the [[Lord of Light]], he not only burns the idols of the Seven on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], but also destroys the godswood in [[Storm's End]] as a sacrifice to the Lord of Light.
