{{Quote|During the Age of Heroes, when Lymond Hightower saw the Gardener kings conquering the Reach, he didn't beat them on the battlefield, but in the godswood. He bound his house to theirs by marriage. And transformed House Hightower from wealthy but relatively minor kings to the greatest lords of the Reach.|[[Pycelle]]|Oldtown (short)}}
'''King of the High Tower'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was a title held by the head of [[House Hightower]] long before [[Aegon's Conquest]].

During the [[Age of Heroes]], King [[Lymond Hightower]] saw [[House Gardener]] become [[King of the Reach|Kings of the Reach]], he arranged a [[marriage]] between the two houses, elevating House Hightower to the most powerful house in the [[Reach]]. The union of the two houses has long-lasting effects, with [[Highgarden]] always defending [[Oldtown]] from attack and allowing the Hightowers to focus on other pursuits such as learning and trade.<ref>"[[Oldtown (short)|Oldtown]]"</ref>
