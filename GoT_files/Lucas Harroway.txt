{{Quote|Not only did Maegor execute his second wife and her father, his own Hand of the King, but he also marched on her family's castle and slaughtered everyone who bore a drop of her family's blood.|[[Varys]]|Maegor the Cruel (short)}}
Lord '''Lucas Harroway'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was the [[Lord of Harrenhal]] and [[Hand of the King]] during the reign of his son-by-law, [[Maegor Targaryen]].

==Biography==
Lucas became Maegor Targaryen's father-by-law when the [[prince]] married his daughter, [[Alys Harroway]]. At some point, he was named [[Hand of the King]] to Maegor.{{Ref|H&L806}}

In 44 AC, Alys had a deformed stillborn baby. Maegor's third wife, Queen [[Tyanna of the Tower]], convinced him that the boy had not been of his seed, but the result of one of Alys's many affairs, and that Lucas himself had helped his daughter conceive a son for the king by sending men of proven fertility to her chambers. King Maegor believed Tyanna and executed her and Lucas, then marched on [[Harrenhal]] and wiped out everyone with a drop of [[House Harroway|Harroway]] blood.{{Ref|H&L806}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Lucas Harroway's story is the same. He is not mentioned in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels.
