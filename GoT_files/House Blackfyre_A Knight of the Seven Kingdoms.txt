'''House Blackfyre'''{{Ref|H&L705}} is an [[exile]]d [[cadet branch]] of [[House Targaryen/A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms|House Targaryen]], founded by [[Daemon Blackfyre]], a [[bastard]] son of King [[Aegon IV Targaryen]], following his [[legitimization]]. Their sigil is a black three-headed [[dragon]] on a red field, a reversal of the Targaryen [[heraldry]].

==History==
House Blackfyre was created by Daemon Waters, the legitimised bastard son of King Aegon IV Targaryen, also known as Aegon the Unworthy, and his cousin [[Daena Targaryen|Daena]]. It took its name from the [[Valyrian steel]] sword [[Blackfyre]], which Aegon gave to Daemon upon [[Knighthood|knighting]] him. As is customary for bastards, Daemon reversed the colors of the Targaryen heraldry for his own sigil.{{Note|In addition to reversing the colors of their father's sigil, bastards also customarily add a bend sinister (a bar going from the bottom-left to top-right corners of the escutcheon) as the top layer. The lack of a bend sinister in the Blackfyre coat of arms may reflect the fact that Daemon was also a legitimized member of House Targaryen.}}

The house was officially founded when Daemon married [[Rohanne of Tyrosh]] and was granted land in the [[Crownlands]] by his half-brother King [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron II]].{{Ref|H&L803}}

Allying with his half brother, the [[Great Bastards|Great Bastard]], [[Aegor Rivers|Aegor "Bittersteel" Rivers]], Daemon eventually [[Blackfyre Rebellion|rebelled]] against Daeron, claiming that the king was a bastard fathered by their uncle, [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]], a rumor first spread by the knight [[Morgil Hastwyck]] purportedly at the instigation of King Aegon IV.{{Ref|H&L803}} At the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]], Daemon and his two eldest sons, [[Aegon Blackfyre|Aegon]] and [[Aemon Blackfyre|Aemon]], were killed by another of Aegon's bastards, [[Brynden Rivers]].{{Ref|H&L414}}

Bittersteel fled across the [[Narrow Sea]] along with the surviving Blackfyres to [[Tyrosh]]. The exiled supporters of House Blackfyre eventually became the [[Golden Company]], under Bittersteel's leadership.{{Ref|H&L705}} The current head of House Blackfyre is [[Daemon Blackfyre (son of Daemon)|Daemon the Younger]], the third son of Daemon the Elder.

==Military ==
[[Golden Company]] in Essos.
