'''''Game of Thrones: The Noble Houses of Westeros''''' is an official book about the ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' TV series, released in December 8, 2015.  The book is 160 pages long.<ref>[http://www.amazon.com/Game-Thrones-Houses-Westeros-Seasons/dp/076245797X ]</ref>

The book is "a detailed guide to the [[Noble house|major houses]] that inhabit the world of Game of Thrones, filled with information on each [[Heraldry|House's sigil]], history, home, family tree, character profiles, weapons, [[Costumes|costumes]], and more." The book is fully illustrated and features photography from the HBO series, Seasons 1-5.

The book is a guide to the eleven ruling [[Great House]]s of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] that appear during the TV series itself.  There are nine major regions in the "Seven Kingdoms", because it also includes the [[Riverlands]] (a border region) and the [[Crownlands]] (the capital region).  Each of these regions has its own ruling Great House.  During the course of the TV series, [[House Stark]] and [[House Tully]] are defeated, after which [[House Bolton]] and [[House Frey]] are elevated to replace them, so they are considered "Great Houses" by this book and included as well.  During the war, "[[House Baratheon]]" also fractures into different factions - as the book was produced at the end of [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]], after [[Renly Baratheon]]'s death in Season 2, it considers these as two different factions which each get their own entry:  "[[Stannis Baratheon]]'s faction" ([[House Baratheon of Dragonstone]]) and "[[Tommen Baratheon]]'s faction" ([[House Baratheon of King's Landing]] - really just an extension of [[House Lannister]]).  As a result the book has a total of twelve sections.

Similar to the online HBO Viewer's Guide for the TV series, it doesn't have individual subsections for the major vassal Houses immediately below each of the Great Houses - such as [[House Umber]] or [[House Karstark]].  Instead, characters from these vassal Houses do appear in the listing of retainers and allies for each Great House section (i.e. [[Greatjon Umber]] is listed as a vassal in the Stark section).<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/game-of-thrones-the-noble-houses-of-westeros-a-review/ “Game of Thrones: The Noble Houses of Westeros” – A Review]</ref>

The book does not contain any exclusive artwork or [[Heraldry]] not previously released, though it does contain behind the scenes closeup images of major characters' costumes on display.
