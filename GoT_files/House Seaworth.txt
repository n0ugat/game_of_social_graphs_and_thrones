'''House Seaworth'''{{Ref|GOT607}} is a [[noble house]] that held fealty to [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone]] and later to [[House Stark]] of [[Winterfell]]. Their lands are located in the [[Stormlands]]. Their home is a small but cozy keep near the sea.

House Seaworth is ruled by the landed [[Knighthood|knight]] Ser [[Davos Seaworth]], the so-called "Onion Knight", a reformed smuggler formerly in the service of Lord [[Stannis Baratheon]] at [[Dragonstone]]. His [[Marriage|wife]] [[Marya Seaworth|Marya]] is usually found at their keep.

==History==
===Background===
House Seaworth came into existence after [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Davos, a smuggler infamous on the [[Narrow Sea]] for being able to smuggle anything anywhere, transported a cargo hold full of onions into the besieged castle of [[Storm's End]], keeping the garrison alive until the war was over. Stannis Baratheon rewarded Davos by [[Knighthood|knighting]] him and giving him lands, though he also insisted on taking the tips of the fingers on Davos's right hand in compensation for his smuggling. Davos judged this fair, since it bought him and his family a more secure future, one he could never have imagined, much less earned for them on his own.<ref>[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/sbaratheon/davos-seaworth/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of Dragonstone, Davos Seaworth entry]</ref>
