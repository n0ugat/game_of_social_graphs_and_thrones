==Narration==
'''Joffrey Baratheon''': ''​Mine. That's what the [[Red Keep]] is. The [[smallfolk]] say that it's color comes from the blood [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]] spilled to win his crown. Fools. Blood doesn't soak into stone, no matter how hard I try.''

''Aegon built his castle of red rock to remind people of the fires he had roasted his enemies in, so whenever [[King's Landing]] looked up, they'd see the price of defiance. He knew the first rule of kings. Only fear keeps men in line.'' 

''Fear and punishment, a lesson he taught his son [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor]]. When the builders finally finished the Red Keep, Maegor executed them all to keep its secrets safe.''

''Rumor has it, miles of hidden passageways run behind the walls and under the floors. One day I'll have to find them.''

''Traitors and women work in shadows. A king has no need for secrecy. Now, people name Maegor "the Cruel," but I doubt any dared in his day. His strength was all too rare in the degenerate [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] blood.'' 

''The simpering [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor]] the Blessed created the [[Maidenvault]] to imprison [[Daena Targaryen|his]] [[Rhaena Targaryen (daughter of Aegon III)|own]] [[Elaena Targaryen|sisters]] and save himself from carnal thoughts. Disgusting! Though I admit a "Princevault" could be amusing when [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] bores me.''

''My favorite place in the Red Keep?''

''There are so many – the Traitors' Walk, where I mount the heads of my enemies. It's a shame flesh rots so slowly. I always run out of spikes.'' 

''The dungeons are also quite nice once you get past the first two levels, a stable for common criminals and private cells for useful highborns.''

''How boring, I know. But then, you come to the [[Black Cells|black cells]]. No windows, no torches, just darkness, and whatever you hear in there with you. Here we keep the greatest traitors until the king is ready for them, and with these, I often like to take my time.''

''But I've heard rumors of an even lower, hidden level, Maegor's favorite. Once a man was taken there, he never saw the sun again nor heard a human voice, nor breathed a breath free of agonizing pain! [[Varys]] must know the way, but that overgrown girl pretends not to. Maybe he fears I'll make him a victim. Maybe I will.''

''Then again, torture chambers are just so private. Better to punish your enemies where everyone can see and remember. Like [[Aegon II Targaryen|that Targaryen]] who forced [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Rhaenyra)|his nephew]] to watch as he fed the boy's [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|traitor mother]] to a [[Sunfyre|dragon]]. Oh, what I could do with a dragon.''

''Even [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys]], fool as he was, knew to burn men alive with an audience; to spread the terror far and wide across his kingdoms.'' 

''Of course, I know my favorite place now! When I sit on the [[Iron Throne]], high in the Red Keep, all of [[Westeros]] scuttles below me like insects, waiting for my heel to land.''

*The only known Kingsguard present during the execution of Rhaenyra Targaryen is Ser Marston Waters. However, it is known that Ser Gyles Belgrave and Ser Willis Fell survived the war.
*Joffrey sounds like he admires Maegor. It is no wonder, since they have so much in common: ruthless, psychotic, sadist kings, who spend their time abusing, torturing and killing people, and are deeply hated by their subjects.
