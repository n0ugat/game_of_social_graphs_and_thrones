{{Quote|My father Quellon was old, and sitting is what old people do best... well, second best. He would have sat out the whole war if not for my brother and me.|[[Euron Greyjoy]]|The Greyjoy Rebellion}}
Lord '''Quellon Greyjoy''' was the [[Lord of the Iron Islands]] during the reign of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. He had three sons: [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]], [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]], and [[Aeron Greyjoy|Aeron]].

==Biography==
During [[Robert's Rebellion]], Quellon's sons Balon and Euron urged him to join the war. He sided with the rebels and sailed to the [[Reach]], where he died in [[Battle at the Mander|battle]] against [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] [[Ships|longships]]. After his death, Balon became Lord of the Iron Islands and pulled out of the war.{{Ref|H&L802}}

==In the books==
In ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Quellon was married three times and had nine sons and one stillborn daughter. His sons were named Harlon, Quenton, Donel, Balon, Euron, Victarion, Urrigon, Aeron, and Robin.

Quellon has been considered one of the wisest of the Greyjoys. He stood six and a half feet tall, and was both strong and fast.

According to ''The World of Ice & Fire'', Quellon fought corsairs and slavers in the [[Summer Sea]] as a young man and commanded a fleet of a hundred longships in the [[War of the Ninepenny Kings]]. Quellon once attacked the Farman fleet and sacked [[Faircastle]].

Quellon was opposed to the [[Old Way]], and tried to assimilate the [[ironborn]] into [[Andals|Andal]] culture by freeing [[thrall]]s, forbidding most reaving, discouraging the taking of [[salt wife|salt wives]], encouraging [[marriage]] alliances with the [[Westeros|mainland]], and bringing [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] to the Isles.

Quellon was succeeded by Balon, his eldest surviving son. Balon rejected most of his father's reforms, and his desire to return to the Old Way led to the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]].
