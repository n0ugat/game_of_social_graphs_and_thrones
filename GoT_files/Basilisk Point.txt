In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the peninsula is named for the large population of [[basilisk]]s inhabiting it.

The [[Valyrian Freehold]] once attempted to colonize Basilisk Point, but failed due to plague and the indigenous Brindled Men. The colonization effort was abandoned during the Fourth [[Ghiscari wars|Ghiscari War]].

Basilisk Point was settled by some of the [[Rhoynar]] during [[Nymeria]]'s [[Rhoynar migration|great exodus]]. Two of their towns were raided by [[Slavery|slavers]], and the Rhoynar eventually abandoned Sothoryos.
