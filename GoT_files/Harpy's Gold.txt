'''Harpy's Gold'''{{Ref|GOT401}} is a type of flower that exists in the region of [[Slaver's Bay]] on the continent of [[Essos]]. It is attractive, but unlike [[dusk rose]]s it cannot be used to make tea, because it is poisonous.

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[Daario Naharis]] gives [[Daenerys Targaryen]] a Dusk rose in a handful of flowers he has picked for her, ostensibly to show her the lay of the land around Meereen, but truly a thinly veiled attempt to woo her.{{Ref|GOT401}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Daario does present Daenerys with some local flowers as they approach Meereen, but this occurs "off screen" between Daenerys's POV chapters: she recalls it as happening recently in her next chapter.  One of these was a Harpy's Gold.
