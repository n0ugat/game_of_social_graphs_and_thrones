==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jaime has previously visited Estermont. Robert's maternal uncles came for his and [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s wedding and stayed for six months, and Robert insisted on returning the courtesy with a two-week visit to Estermont. Jaime followed Robert one night, confirming Cersei's suspicions that Robert was having sex with his widowed cousin. Jaime asked Cersei if she wanted Robert dead, but instead Jaime and Cersei have sex, beginning their long secret incestuous extramarital affair. Cersei likes to believe that her son [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] was conceived that same night.
