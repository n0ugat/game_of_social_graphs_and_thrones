{{Dialogue a-b|Renly|Why is your stag on fire?|Melisandre|The King has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light.|King [[Renly Baratheon]] and Lady [[Melisandre]]|Garden of Bones (episode)}}
'''House Baratheon of Dragonstone''' is an extinct [[cadet branch]] of the original [[House Baratheon]] of [[Storm's End]] and was the ruling house of the island of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] after the defeat of [[House Targaryen]] in [[Robert's Rebellion]]. [[Stannis Baratheon]], the head of the house, was a claimant to the [[Iron Throne]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]].

Their seat was the island fortress of [[Dragonstone]] in [[Blackwater Bay]]. The houses of Blackwater Bay, also known as the Lords of the Narrow Sea, are sworn directly to Dragonstone.

Following the deaths of [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]], [[Selyse Baratheon|Selyse]] and [[Shireen Baratheon]], House Baratheon of Dragonstone has become officially extinct and leaving the lordship over Dragonstone vacant. [[House Targaryen]] retook the island as part of their reconquest of Westeros and the parent house of this branch of House Baratheon revived when the bastard son of [[Robert Baratheon]], [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] was legitimized by Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and she granted him the lordship over [[Storm's End]]. 

Their [[house words]] were "Ours is the Fury,"<ref>"[[House Baratheon (short)|House Baratheon]]"</ref> which they shared with their overlords and fellow [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|cadet branches]]. However, the most common saying of the house was "For The Night is Dark and Full of Terrors." This was also a common saying of followers of the [[Lord of Light]], who was the official religion of the house due to the influence of the [[red priest]]ess [[Melisandre]].

==History==
===Background===
[[House Baratheon]] became the ruling house of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] when Stannis's brother [[Robert Baratheon]] deposed King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. Stannis fought for Robert in the preceding [[Robert's Rebellion|civil war]]. He was besieged within the family seat [[Storm's End]]. When the siege was lifted Stannis took [[Dragonstone]], the seat of [[House Targaryen]]. He was awarded the castle as his own by Robert but was slighted when Storm's End was given to his younger brother [[Renly Baratheon]]. Stannis served Robert as [[Master of Ships]] on his [[Small Council]].<ref>HBO viewers guide, season 1 guide to houses, House Baratheon entry</ref>

==Military strength==
At the outset of the War of the Five Kings, Stannis had the smallest army of any faction, with only his immediate vassals from islands in Blackwater Bay offering support. Stannis did, however, have the largest strength at sea, with most of the [[royal fleet]] siding with him, because he had commanded them for years as [[Master of Ships]] under Robert. So a few ships remained loyal to the Lannisters that they could not hope to challenge Stannis's control of Blackwater Bay. Davos further bolstered Stannis's strength at sea by hiring the [[Mercenary|sellsail]] fleet of the pirate [[Salladhor Saan]], numbering thirty ships.<ref name=":0"/> 
[[File:Dragonstone Fleet.PNG|thumb|220x220px|The Dragonstone Fleet along with Salladhor Saan's armada before the Battle of the Blackwater, en route to pick up Renly's Baratheon army that defected after his death to Stannis.]]
After Renly's assassination, many lords of the Stormlands and at least two houses of the Reach ([[House Florent]] and [[House Fossoway]]) bent the knee to Stannis, increasing his troops to more than 10,000. Stannis led them in a massive assault on King's Landing, but most of his forces were destroyed in [[Battle of the Blackwater|the resulting battle]], mainly due to the arrival of the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]]'s reinforcements.

The defeat effectively knocked Stannis out of the war for over a year, as with no major armies or fleet he was now functionally trapped on Dragonstone; he had about 4,000 fighting men and 32 ships left.<ref name=":1"/> The only thing that prevented a major Lannister assault finishing him off was that the Lannisters still lacked sufficient sea power. 

Stannis managed to receive a loan from the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]],<ref name=":1"/> which he used to hire sellswords, increasing his troops to 6,000. However, most of his soldiers abandoned him, leaving around 1,300 infantrymen to [[Battle in the ice|fight the Boltons]],<ref>See the calculation in [[Battle in the ice#Numbers]]</ref> which were quite easily and swiftly destroyed by the massive Bolton cavalry.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>

Despite being outnumbered, Dragonstone men seem to be well-equipped and well-trained although at the cost of morale. Dragonstone soldiers are distinguishable from other Stormlander soldiers, as they have burgonet helmets of grey steel with cheek guards. They are armored with long uniforms of plate-and-mail armor and black coats, while their kite-shaped shields have the sigil of their house. Their men also require morale, as seen during the Battle of the Blackwater, where most of Stannis's army retreated after seeing the combined Lannister and Tyrell army leading to the surrender of the Stormlords. Their men also cannot handle extreme conditions as seen during his intentions to retake Winterfell from the Boltons, which lead to the desertion of his already exhausted and demoralized army.

==Family tree==
{{Baratheon tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the following additional houses are sworn to Dragonstone:

*House Bar Emmon of [[Sharp Point]].
*House Celtigar of [[Claw Isle]].
*House Massey of [[Stonedance]].
*House Sunglass of Sweetport Sound.

Following the deaths of Robert and Renly, House Baratheon of Dragonstone is actually the only surviving branch of the original "House Baratheon". Renly died without issue, and while Robert had many [[bastard]] children they are illegitimate. There has been no mention in the books of other cousins of the main line who might continue it. As Stannis is the younger brother of Robert, not a far removed relative, his "House Baratheon of Dragonstone" technically became the ''de facto'' "House Baratheon" after Renly died, but Stannis continues to use his altered heraldry. Of course, the Lannisters continue to maintain the farce that [[Cersei Lannister]]'s children are Robert's heirs, forming [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|House "Baratheon" of King's Landing]].
