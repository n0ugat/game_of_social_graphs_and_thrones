Ser '''Howland Sharp''' is a [[Knighthood|knight]] sworn to [[House Targaryen/House of the Dragon|House Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Howland is [[Viserys I Targaryen|King Viserys]]'s [[Royal Huntsman]].{{Ref|HOTD103}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Howland oversees the royal hunt in the [[Kingswood]] on Prince [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]]'s second [[nameday]].{{Ref|HOTD103}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', there is no character named Howland Sharp. In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is a House Sharp from the [[Iron Islands]], but it is unlikely that Howland is a member of this house. [[Ironborn]] knights are very rare (only occurring in houses following the [[Faith of the Seven]] rather than the [[Drowned God]]), and it is even rarer still that a nobleman from the Iron Islands would join a mainlander's retinue as a sworn sword.
