{{Quote|Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered.|Ser [[Lancel Lannister]] to [[Sansa Stark]]|Garden of Bones (episode)}}
Ser '''Stafford Lannister''' was [[Tywin Lannister]]'s cousin. He was killed at the [[Battle of Oxcross]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Stafford is the brother of [[Joanna Lannister]], Tywin's late wife, and the maternal uncle of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]], and [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]]. He is also a cousin of Tywin and [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]].{{Ref|GOT204}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
Stafford is given the command over the new Lannister army, that was raised in the [[Westerlands]] to replace the troops which were destroyed in the [[Battle of Whispering Wood]].{{Ref|GOT204}}

[[Robb Stark|Robb]]'s army sneaks through the mountains bordering the Westerlands, and ambushes Stafford's army at night in their own camp at [[Oxcross]]. Stafford's army of raw recruits is massacred, and he is killed.{{Ref|GOT204}}

==Family==
{{Lannister tree (lesser branch)}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Stafford Lannister is the brother of Joanna Lannister. He and his sister were the children of Lord [[Tytos Lannister]]'s younger brother. Thus, both Joanna and Stafford were first cousins of Tywin and the main branch of the family.

In his youth, Stafford and two more Lannisters were captured by [[Ellyn Reyne|Lady Tarbeck]] in retaliation for the imprisonment of [[Walderan Tarbeck|her husband]] by Tytos. She threatened to kill the captives if her husband would be harmed. Tywin suggested his father to send Lord Tarbeck back to his wife in three pieces, but the soft-hearted Tytos complied and returned Tarbeck unharmed in exchange for the three Lannisters.{{Bookref|ASOS|44}}

Stafford dies in the Battle of Oxcross, killed by Lord [[Rickard Karstark]].{{Bookref|ACOK|32}} Both Jaime and [[Brynden Tully]] consider him a poor commander, as he didn't scout the area believing Robb was far away.{{Bookref|ACOK|7}}{{Bookref|ASOS|44}} Tyrion is also very critical of Stafford for his failure and getting himself killed, calling him "my mutton-headed uncle." Robb had been led by [[Grey Wind]] along a goat path and had thus bypasses fortified positions in order to attack undetected.

The Lannister survivors regrouped at [[Lannisport]] under Ser Daven Lannister, Stafford's son and widely considered to be a more intelligent commander than his father. Daven wants to avenge his father, but Robb robs him of his vengeance by executing Rickard Karstark.{{Bookref|AFFC|33}}

Jaime reacts indifferently when [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] tells him about Stafford's death; he mentions that Cersei used to call him "Uncle Dolt".{{Bookref|ACOK|55}}
