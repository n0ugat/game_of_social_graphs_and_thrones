'''Anara''' is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] living in [[Braavos]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Anara is a [[Prostitution|prostitute]] living in [[Braavos]]. She practices her trade in the same brothel as [[Lhara]] and [[Brea]].{{Ref|GOT509}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Anara is shown to Ser [[Meryn Trant]] after Brea is dismissed for being too old for Meryn's tastes. Even though the [[Braavosi madam|madam]] states Anara is the most expensive of the establishment's girls and assures Meryn she's worth the price, Meryn discards her, finding even her too old. This makes the madam realize with some distaste what Trant is after.{{Ref|GOT509}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Anara. During her time as "Cat of the Canals", however, [[Arya Stark|Arya]] does meet a number of courtesans.
