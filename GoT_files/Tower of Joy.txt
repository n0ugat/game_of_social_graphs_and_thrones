The '''Tower of Joy'''{{Webref|name=MGOT |author=Unknown author |date=June 28, 2016 |url=https://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/got-connections-ned-promise-tower-of-joy-infographic |title=See the Connections Behind Ned’s Promise With This Infographic |website=Making Game of Thrones |access-date=January 9, 2024 }} is a tower located on the northern edge of the [[Red Mountains]] of [[Dorne]]. This was the home of Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] and [[Lyanna Stark]] after they eloped and [[Marriage|married]] in secret. It also is the birthplace of their son, [[Jon Snow|Aegon Targaryen]]. 

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
During a [[Greenseer]] vision under the guidance of [[Brynden Rivers]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and his mentor witness the [[Skirmish at the Tower of Joy|confrontation]] between [[Eddard Stark]] and five of his bannermen against Ser [[Arthur Dayne]] and Ser [[Gerold Hightower]], the last members of the [[Kingsguard]] still loyal to the late King [[Aerys II Targaryen]]. The fight ends with the deaths of all swordsmen, save for Ned and [[Howland Reed]]. Ned then enters the Tower after hearing a woman's scream from inside.<ref>"[[Oathbreaker]]"</ref>

Some time later, Bran enters another vision by communing with a [[Weirwood]] tree in the [[Haunted Forest]]. This time, Bran follows his father into the Tower of Joy, and witnesses the reunion of his father with a dying [[Lyanna Stark]], who entrusts Ned with the protection of her newborn son, a baby who will grow up as [[Jon Snow]].<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Tower of Joy is located in the Red Mountains of Dorne. It lies in the Prince's Pass, with the [[Nightsong]] to the north and [[Kingsgrave]] to the south. This tower was named the "Tower of Joy" by Prince [[Rhaegar Targaryen]].

Ned accompanied six men to the tower in order to retrieve his sister. His six companions were:
*[[Howland Reed]]
*Willam Dustin, husband of Lady [[Barbrey Dustin]] and the head of [[House Dustin]]
*Ethan Glover, former squire to the late [[Brandon Stark]]
*Martyn Cassel, father of [[Jory Cassel]] and brother of [[Rodrik Cassel]]
*Theo Wull, of Clan Wull
*Ser Mark Ryswell

While Ned is lying injured, following [[Skirmish at Littlefinger's brothel|a bloody encounter with Jaime]], he dreams of the fight. He recalls seeing the Kingsguard in their white cloaks. After the fight, which only Ned and Howland Reed survived, Ned heard his sister's screams coming from the tower. When he found her, she was in a bed of blood. He made an unknown promise to her before she died. Her words "Promise me" haunt Ned for the remainder of his life.

After the battle, Ned had the tower torn down and used its stones to build cairns to bury his dead comrades. Lady Dustin was deeply offended that Ned merely laid her husband to rest in the Dornish mountains, but spared no effort to bring Lyanna's body back to Winterfell to be buried there, causing her to become a staunch ally of [[Roose Bolton]]'s against [[House Stark]].
