'''Seagard'''{{Ref|GOT210}} is a castle in the [[Riverlands]]. It is the seat of [[House Mallister]], a vassal house holding fealty to [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. The castle is located north of [[Riverrun]], on the coast of [[Ironman's Bay]]. It lies between the [[Red Fork]] and the [[Blue Fork]] of the [[Trident]]. Seagard was built as a defense against marauders from the [[Iron Islands]].

==History==
During the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], Seagard was [[Assault on Seagard|assaulted]] by an [[Ironborn]] fleet led by [[Rodrik Greyjoy]], Lord [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]]'s eldest son and heir. Lord [[Jason Mallister]] slew him in combat and threw the Ironborn back into the sea.<ref>"[[Greyjoy Rebellion - Theon Greyjoy]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Seagard is the largest and indeed only port of note on the west coast of the [[Riverlands]], consisting of a castle, town and port. [[House Mallister]] maintains a small fleet of half a dozen war [[ships|longships]] and two war galleys at Seagard.

House Mallister is a loyal vassal of House Tully, and fought underneath their banner during [[Robert's Rebellion]]. Lord [[Jason Mallister]] is noted as one of the most stalwart, reliable and honorable of the river lords. When [[Hoster Tully]] declared for King [[Robb Stark]] during the [[War of the Five Kings]], Lord Jason also supported that move and threw his loyalty behind Robb.

Following the Red Wedding, Seagard is one of the three strongholds which have not yielded to the Iron Throne (alongside [[Riverrun]] and [[Raventree Hall]]). Lord Jason is forced to surrender, though, since the Freys threaten to kill his son Patrek.{{Bookref|ASOS|60}}{{Bookref|AFFC|38}}
