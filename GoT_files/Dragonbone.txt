'''Dragonbone'''{{Ref|GOT102}} is a durable material that, as its name indicates, is harvested from the bones of [[dragon]]s.{{Ref|GOT102}} Due to its high iron content,{{Con|ASOIAF}} dragonbone is black.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', all observed dragon skulls are white like any ordinary skeleton, even though the dragonbone hilt of the [[Valyrian steel dagger]] is notably black. A book that [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] is reading in "[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]" depicts an identical dagger while explaining that the [[Valyrians]] decorated their weapons with [[dragonglass]], possibly indicating that the black part of the hilt is dragonglass, not dragonbone.{{Ref|GOT701}}

In ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', the appearance of [[Balerion]]'s skull is highly different to its appearance in ''Game of Thrones''. Besides being larger and differently shaped, it is also black the way dragonbone is described in the books.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, dragonbone is as strong as other metals, such as steel, yet lighter and more flexible. Dragonbone bows are highly sought after as they can fire arrows a much greater distance than normal wooden bows.

During her marriage ceremony to ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]] participates in a traditional [[Dothraki]] ritual in which the bride is ceremonially offered a whip, [[arakh]], and bow, refuses these gifts, and insists that they be given to her husband. The bow in question is described as being made of dragonbone and standing taller than Daenerys herself.  

''The World of Ice and Fire'' sourcebook says that dragonbone can be found in the [[Shadow Lands]] beyond [[Asshai]].
