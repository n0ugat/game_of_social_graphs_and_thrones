'''Cragorn'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is a crewman on [[Euron Greyjoy]]'s ship, the ''[[Silence]]''. He has a large tattoo of a bird of prey on his chest.{{Ref|H&L602}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cragorn is a crewman on the ''Silence'', noted for having a large tattoo of a bird of prey on his chest. His head is shaved and he wears rings of gold, jade, and jet on his arms.

It is unknown if Euron ripped out Cragon's tongue, as he does for all of his crew. It is also unclear if he is an [[ironborn]] or is one of the foreign sailors that Euron picked up during one the many years he was raiding distant lands.

During the [[Kingsmoot on Old Wyk#In the books|kingsmoot on Old Wyk]], Cragon blows a huge black horn called "Dragonbinder" (Euron claims it is a dragon horn) to announce Euron's claim to the title of King of the Iron Islands, and later dies. A maester cuts him open and discovers his lungs had been charred and turned black; moreover, his tattoo bled, every feather of it. Euron tells Victarion about that, rather offhandedly; Victarion shudders, though he is is skeptical about Euron's words.

When the [[Iron Fleet]] is near the [[Slaver's Bay]], Victarion shows Dragonbinder to the Red Priest [[Kinvara#In the books|Moqorro]] and tells him about Cragorn's strange death. Moqorro believes the story and explains to Victarion that whoever blows the horn will die.

While Cragorn and the horn didn't appear in the TV version of the Kingsmoot, in a subsequent interview actor [[Pilou Asbæk]] (Euron) heavily implied that this was simply pushed back to appear later in the TV show.<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2016/05/game-of-thrones-pilou-asbaek-euron-greyjoy.html ]</ref>
