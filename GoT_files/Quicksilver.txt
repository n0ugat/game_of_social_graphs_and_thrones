'''Quicksilver'''{{Con|TWOI&F}} was a [[dragon]] belonging to [[Aenys Targaryen]] and [[Prince of Dragonstone|Prince]] [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon Targaryen]].

==Biography==
Prince [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Aenys)|Aegon Targaryen]] claimed Quicksilver after the death of his father, King [[Aenys Targaryen]], and rode her in the [[Battle Beneath the Gods Eye]], during which she was killed by [[Balerion|Balerion the Black Dread]].{{Ref|H&L806}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'' and ''Fire & Blood'', Quicksilver was one of the second-generation dragons hatched soon after the Targaryen Conquest.  

Quicksilver first bonded with [[Aenys Targaryen]], in the year 10 AC. Aenys, who had been sickly from birth, deteriorated significantly after his mother died in the [[First Dornish War]], but he quickly became healthy after bonding with the dragon. This helped to end the rumor that such a sickly [[prince]] might have been a [[bastard]] fathered by someone other than [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]].

Aenys flew Quicksilver to attend a feast in [[Sunspear]] celebrating the tenth anniversary of the peace between [[Dorne]] and the [[Iron Throne]]. Aenys was at [[Highgarden]] with Quicksilver when he received the news of his father's death, and flew the dragon to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] to attend the late king's funeral. When Harren the Red rebelled at [[Harrenhal]], Aenys and Quicksilver were at [[Riverrun]]. Lord Tully urged the king to descend on Harrenhal with Quicksilver [[Burning of Harrenhal|as his father did with Balerion]], but he refused.

After Aenys's death, his son Prince Aegon bonded with Quicksilver. Quicksilver died in the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye when Balerion ripped a wing from her body mid-air, after which both the dragon and her rider fell to their deaths.

Quicksilver was presumably silver to white in color - much like [[Meraxes]], the dragon of Aenys's mother Rhaenys, but it isn't stated if Meraxes was also Quicksilver's mother. Quicksilver's presumed gender is also inconsistently given, though it is usually referred to as a "she":  dragons alternate between male and female, a fact forgotten by later generations of men, who just assume that any dragon seen laying eggs must have always been female. Some of the other dragons such as [[Syrax]] are explicitly called "she-dragons" and "queens" because they were known to have laid eggs, but hasn't been stated if Quicksilver was also known to have laid eggs.
