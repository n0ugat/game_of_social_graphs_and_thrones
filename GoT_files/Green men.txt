The '''green men'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} are a religious group devoted to the [[old gods]] who guard the [[Isle of Faces]], the island at the center of the [[Gods Eye]] lake.

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
[[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] glimpses one of the green men walking near the [[weirwood]] tree in [[Harrenhal]]'s [[godswood]].{{Ref|HOTD208}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the green men are said to have been founded after the [[Pact]] between the [[First Men]] and the [[Children of the Forest]]. The [[Andals]] were unable to defeat the order during their [[Coming of the Andals|invasion of Westeros]]. The Isle of Faces is seemingly protected by strong [[magic]]s wielded by the green men, as anyone who attempts to land at the island is swept away by the winds. It is conjectured that there are still Children of the Forest living on the isle, under the protection of the green men.

Some nursery tales say that the green men have horns and dark green skin. According to [[Old Nan]], the green men ride great elks and sometimes have antlers themselves. Most [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] believe that they simply wear green clothes and horned headdresses.

Otherwise, there have been no confirmed sightings of the green men or recorded visits to the Isle of Faces for thousands of years. [[Howland Reed]] purportedly visited the green men in his 16th year and stayed with them for a whole winter. He then left the Isle of Faces in 281 AC to travel to the nearby [[Great Tourney at Harrenhal]].
