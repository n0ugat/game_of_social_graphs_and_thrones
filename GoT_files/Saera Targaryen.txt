==Behind the scenes==
Saera was mentioned by name in an earlier draft of the script for "[[Driftmark (episode)|Driftmark]]," in which [[Harrold Westerling]] tells of Ser [[Chester Mooton]], her sworn protector, and the fate he met as a warning to [[Criston Cole]].{{Webref|name=Script |author=@darksvster |date=March 10, 2024 |url=https://twitter.com/darksvster/status/1766871640212987992 |title=Missing Scene From the House of the Dragon Script |website=X |access-date=March 11, 2024 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Saera was born in 67 AC. She was courageous, disobedient, and manipulative, making her an extremely difficult child. Her first word was "no." She often performed cruel pranks on her sister [[Daella Targaryen|Daella]] and the court [[fool]] Tom Turnip, and she once stole the white cloaks of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] and dyed them pink. Her [[septa]] considered her to be an "evil child."

Saera was known to be exceedingly promiscuous, entertaining an uncounted number of [[squire]]s, [[Knighthood|knights]], [[Lordship|lords]], and other men of the court. She had three favorites: Ser Braxton Beesbury, Lord Roy Connington, and Jonah Mooton. Saera, her favorites, and her two closest friends Perianne Moore and Alys Turnberry, were involved in a royal scandal in 84 AC: two men of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] found Tom Turnip being entertained by [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] at the Blue Pearl, with Beesbury, Connington, and Mooton among the patrons laughing at the royal fool. When questioned, Jonah Mooton said that it had been Princess Saera's idea. The lordlings were brought before the king himself, and then imprisoned in the [[Black Cells]] for refusing to reveal any further information concerning Saera. The king and queen then questioned Perianne Moore and Alys Turnberry, who revealed that they and Saera had practiced at kissing, before daring each other to kiss real boys. Saera proclaimed that she would kiss a man, and went to Braxton Beesbury.

Jaehaerys summoned Saera to the [[throne room]], where he scolded her for the joke she played on Tom Turnip. When told of the imprisonment of her companions, according to Septon [[Barth]], Saera "went from denial to dismissal to quibbling to contrition to accusation to justification to defiance" within the span of an hour. Jaehaerys then asked her if any of the three had claimed her maidenhead, to which she revealed that they all believed themselves to be the first. She then suggested marrying all three of them, comparing herself to the polygamous kings [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and [[Maegor Targaryen|Maegor the Cruel]]. Saera proudly comparing herself to Maegor sent Jaehaerys into a black rage, immediately placing her under arrest in her bedchamber. He went so far as to disown her the next day. That night, Saera escaped and attempted to steal a [[dragon]] from the [[Dragonpit]], further enraging her father. He then had her placed in a tower cell, under guard by Jonquil Darke. Ser Braxton eventually demanded [[trial by combat]], in which he fought Jaehaerys himself. Saera watched from her tower cell as the king killed Braxton with [[Blackfyre]].

Saera was sent to [[Oldtown]] to join the [[Faith of the Seven]], under the tuition of her sister, [[Maegelle Targaryen|Septa Maegelle]]. She became a novice of the [[Silent Sisters]]. The next year, however, she fled and went into self-[[exile]] in [[Lys]], where she became a prostitute dressed as a novice of the Faith. Upon learning of this, Jaehaerys said that Saera had always been a whore. It was said that Jaehaerys had never been the same after this scandal. Saera later moved to [[Volantis]], where she ran her own pleasure house.

Saera did not press her claim at the [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council of 101 AC]], proclaiming that she had her own kingdom in Volantis. Three of her [[bastard]] sons, however, did arrive at [[Harrenhal]].

On his deathbed, King Jaehaerys grew increasingly demented and often mistook the young [[Alicent Hightower]] for his daughters. Near the end, he was convinced that Alicent was Saera.

There is no mention in the book that Saera was Hugh's mother.
