'''Regicide'''{{Ref|GOT404}} is the deliberate act of murdering a [[King|monarch]] and is considered one of the most serious and stigmatized crimes in the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Whoever commits it is dubbed a kingslayer.{{Ref|GOT103}} It usually refers to the act of killing one's own king, making the act a form of [[oathbreaking]]. Killing a king in battle is generally not considered kingslaying, particularly if the dead king is a rival to one's own or an otherwise declared enemy. 

Somewhat like [[kinslaying]], [[incest]], or violating [[guest right]], anyone who kills a king is believed to be cursed. Because the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]] is blessed by the [[High Septon]] of the [[Faith of the Seven]] at his coronation, it is considered a heinous crime in that religion to kill the king. This applies even when the king is a [[Aerys II Targaryen|reviled tyrant]].

* King [[Orys I]] was killed by his brother.
* King [[Aegon I Targaryen]], who attacked [[Harrenhal]] with dragonfire during the [[Burning of Harrenhal]], thereby roasting King [[Harren Hoare]] alive. Aegon commits a second kingslaying when he and his sister-wives, [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]], used their dragons to crush the combined forces of the [[Reach]] and the [[Westerlands]], killing [[Mern IX Gardener]], the [[King of the Reach]], and all his potential heirs at the [[Field of Fire]].
* Lord [[Orys Baratheon]], who slew King [[Argilac Durrandon]] during the [[Last Storm]].
* Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], perhaps the most notable example of a kingslayer, who killed [[Aerys II Targaryen]] during the [[Sack of King's Landing]]. Jaime's actions were considered especially heinous, as he was, in fact, a member of Aerys's own [[Kingsguard]], and took a holy vow to lay down his life in defense of his king.<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref> Jaime actually killed Aerys in order to foil his scheme to destroy [[King's Landing]], but since he never told anyone the truth (with the exception of [[Tyrion Lannister|his brother]] and later [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]]) - everyone assumed he killed Aerys so the Lannisters would seize the throne. It is unknown whether Jaime would still bear the stigma of kingslayer if he revealed his real motive, particularly since there are only a few who would even believe him, and others wouldn't care what was the reason. He committed a second kingslaying by killing King [[Euron Greyjoy]] during the [[Battle of King's Landing]].<ref name=":0">"[[The Bells]]"</ref>
* Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], along with her cousin [[Lancel Lannister|Lancel]], conspired to [[Assassination of Robert Baratheon|kill King Robert I Baratheon]]. At Cersei's orders, Lancel gave Robert a strong wine, which dulled his reflexes, and that resulted in him being fatally injured by a boar.<ref>"[[You Win or You Die]]"</ref>
* King [[Stannis Baratheon]], who conceives a [[Shadow|shadow assassin]] with [[Melisandre]] to [[Assassination of Renly Baratheon|kill King Renly]]. This may not be considered a true example of kingslaying, as Renly himself was a usurper, and was in open rebellion against his elder brother, the rightful king, who in turn was in rebellion against the nominal King on the Iron Throne. Renly never sat upon the Iron Throne, not even coming particularly close to doing so.<ref>"[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]"</ref>
* Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] locks King [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]] in an empty vault for betraying her and stealing her dragons. She committed a second kingslaying by attacking the [[Red Keep]] with dragonfire during the Battle of King's Landing, thereby causing debris to crush Queen Cersei Lannister to death.<ref name=":0" />
*Lord [[Roose Bolton]] murdered King [[Robb Stark]] at the [[Red Wedding]].<ref>"[[The Rains of Castamere (episode)|The Rains of Castamere]]"</ref> For his part in Robb's death, Walder Frey considers himself a kingslayer, which in his twisted psyche is a source of pride rather than shame.<ref>"[[The Winds of Winter]]"</ref>
*Lord [[Petyr Baelish]] and Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]], who [[Purple Wedding|assassinated King Joffrey Baratheon]], with poisoned wine at his wedding.<ref>"[[Oathkeeper (episode)|Oathkeeper]]"</ref> 
*[[Jon Snow]] shot [[Mance Rayder]], the [[King-Beyond-the-Wall]], to spare him from being burned alive.<ref>"[[The Wars To Come]]"</ref> He committed a second regicide by [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|killing Queen Daenerys Targaryen]] to save Westeros after she [[Battle of King's Landing|massacred the population of King's Landing]].<ref>"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>   
* Ser Brienne of Tarth became a kingslayer when she killed King Stannis Baratheon, after his defeat at the [[battle in the ice]], in order to avenge Renly's death.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>
* King Euron Greyjoy murdered his elder brother, King [[Balon Greyjoy]], by [[Assassination of Balon Greyjoy|throwing him from a bridge]].<ref>"[[Home]]"</ref>

==Alleged and suspected kingslayers==
*[[Visenya Targaryen]] was suspected of poisoning [[Aenys Targaryen|Aenys I Targaryen]] (it is unknown if the suspicion was correct).
*[[Eddard Stark]] was falsely accused of plotting the assassination of King Joffrey.
*[[Brienne of Tarth]] has been wrongly held suspect for Renly's murder.
*[[Tyrion Lannister]] and [[Sansa Stark]] were falsely accused of assassinating King Joffrey.

==Contemplated and would-be kingslayers==
*Prince [[Aemond Targaryen]] attacked in battle his brother, King [[Aegon II Targaryen]] burning him with the fire of his dragon [[Vhagar]], and contemplated killing him after falling unconscious to the field with his dragon. He was stopped by [[Criston Cole]].<ref>"[[The Red Dragon and the Gold]]"</ref>
*It is implied that [[Varys]], using one of his [[Martha|little birds]], attempted to poison Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]] prior to the [[Battle of King's Landing|attack of King's Landing]], to prevent the slaughter of innocent lives. His plot was foiled because Daenerys wouldn't eat anything, consumed by grief over the deaths of [[Rhaegal]] and [[Missandei]].<ref name=":0" />
*[[Arya Stark]] had plans to kill Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], but was eventually dissuaded by the [[Sandor Clegane|Hound]].<ref name=":0" />
*[[Sansa Stark]] was about to push King Joffrey off the ramparts of Traitor's Walk in the Red Keep, as a payback for [[Execution of Eddard Stark|her father's death]]. She was stopped by the Hound before she could do this.<ref>"[[Fire and Blood]]"</ref>
*King [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Melisandre]] sought to kill the kings [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Balon Greyjoy|Balon]] and Joffrey by performing [[Leech ritual|a ritual of blood magic]]. It is doubtful the ritual had anything to do with the deaths of the intended victims.<ref>"[[Second Sons (episode)|Second Sons]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the taboo against kingslaying is much the same.

[[Jaime Lannister]] directly states that in the eyes of gods and men, [[kinslaying]] is considered to be even worse than regicide - thus while men often think of him as honorless and call him "the Kingslayer", Jaime still has major personal reservations against kinslaying, which would make him sink even lower on the moral scale. Unlike Cersei, Jaime actually never liked Joffrey and recognized him for the sociopathic monster that he is. Having already killed one king, and been made a social pariah for it, Jaime no longer had any personal restrictions on simply killing another king. Even so, Jaime never considered killing Joffrey to remove him from the line of succession, not because he was a king, but because if nothing else, Jaime would not kill his own son.
