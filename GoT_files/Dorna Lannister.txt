{{Lannister tree}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Dorna is the daughter of Harys Swyft, the Knight of Cornfield and a loyal bannerman of [[House Lannister]]. Her father married her to Kevan and they have three sons: Lancel and the twins Martyn and Willem. They also have a daughter, Janei. Lancel is their eldest child and Janei the youngest.

According to Kevan, Dorna is a gentle soul, never comfortable except at home with friends and kin around her. She prays seven times a day and loves needlework and flowers.

In contrast to Robert's mocking words in the TV show, Dorna is described "chinless lady, flat-chested and chicken-legged" with her lack of chin shared by her father, yet she is still very loved by her husband.

In his last moments, after being fatally injured by Varys, Kevan's last thought is about Dorna.
