'''Master of Casterly Rock'''{{Ref|HOTD105}} was a title used by [[Jason Lannister]] instead of "[[Lord of Casterly Rock]]."{{Ref|HOTD105}} It is unknown if other heads of [[House Lannister/House of the Dragon|House Lannister]] used this style.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, no such title is mentioned. There are a number of houses using the style "Master" instead of "Lord." In the [[north]], which doesn't traditionally espouse [[knighthood]], the title "Master" denotes a noble who is of lower standing than a lord, equivalent to a landed knight (in some cases this is only a formality. [[House Glover]] for instance are styled as "Masters of Deepwood Motte," but have a number of vassals sworn to them, making them more powerful than most houses in the north).
