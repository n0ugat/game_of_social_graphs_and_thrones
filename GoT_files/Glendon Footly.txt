Lord '''Glendon Footly''' was the head of [[House Footly]] and Lord of [[Tumbleton]] during the [[Dance of the Dragons]]. 

==Biography==
===Background===
Glendon was one of the [[Blacks]] who supported [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] during the civil war. 

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', his name is only given as "Lord Footly", though his wife's name "Sharis" was given in the text.

Because House Tyrell's lord was an infant boy his regent mother declared Highgarden's neutrality in the war, and different Reach vassals picked different sides. The southern half of the Reach had been under the political influence of the Hightowers in Oldtown for centuries, but the more distant vassals in the north resented the Hightowers acting as if they were the rulers of all the Reach when they were officially vassals co-equal to them under the Tyrells. 

Tumbleton is in the far northeast of the Reach, farther north along the [[Roseroad]] from [[Bitterbridge]] (ruled by [[House Caswell]], who also declared for Rhaenyra). As the main Hightower army under Lord [[Ormund Hightower|Ormund]] and [[Daeron Targaryen]] advanced north up the [[Roseroad]], Tumbleton was strategically important as the last major castle between them and King's Landing itself.
