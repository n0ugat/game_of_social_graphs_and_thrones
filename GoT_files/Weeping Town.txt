The '''Weeping Town'''{{Ref|THTDB201}} is a town in the [[Stormlands]], to the south-east of the [[Rainwood]] and along the [[Sea of Dorne]]. It possibly contains a seat for a [[noble house]], called the '''Weeping Tower'''.{{Ref|GOT701}}

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
The Weeping Town appears on [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]'s map of [[Westeros]] in the courtyard of [[Maegor's Holdfast]], marked as "Weeping Tower."<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Weeping Town is a market town ruled by House Whitehead. It includes three inns: the Broken Shield, the Loon, and the Drunken Dornishman. The town was named for [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Daeron I Targaryen]], as it is the place his corpse was brought after his death in the [[Conquest of Dorne]]. It is also unclear in the books whether the "Weeping Tower" exists within the town, or if this is just a typing error.
