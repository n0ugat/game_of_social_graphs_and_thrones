{{Quote|It's a message. From the Night King.|[[Beric Dondarrion]] upon seeing the displayed corpse of [[Ned Umber]]|Winterfell (Game of Thrones)}}
The '''fall of Last Hearth''' is an engagement during the [[Great War]] between the living of [[House Umber]] and the [[Wight|army of the dead]] led by the [[Night King]] and the [[White Walkers]]. 

==History==
=== Prelude ===
[[File:505 Bolton map 1.jpg|thumb|Last Hearth is the closest castle to the Wall.]]
[[Last Hearth]] is the seat of [[House Umber]] and the northernmost castle before reaching the [[Wall]], thus making it the closest settlement to the Wall. As [[Jon Snow]] previously predicted, Last Hearth was the first major obstacle in the path of the [[White Walkers]] and their [[Wight|army of the dead]] since [[Breaching of the Wall|breaching the Wall]].

Following the death of [[Smalljon Umber]] at the [[Battle of the Bastards]], his son [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Ned Umber]] swears allegiance to [[House Stark]].<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref> He is instructed by the Starks to return to the castle and rally the bannermen sworn to his house.<ref name=":0">"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

===Battle===
The forces of House Umber clash with the army of the dead led by the White Walkers, and are defeated at Last Hearth.

=== Aftermath ===
[[File:801 Last Hearth Courtyard.png|thumb|Last Hearth is found abandoned.]]
Sometime after the battle, a group of [[Free Folk]] and [[Brotherhood Without Banners]] led by [[Tormund]] and [[Lord of Blackhaven|Lord]] [[Beric Dondarrion]], makes it to Last Hearth after escaping the [[Breaching of the Wall|fall]] of the [[Wall]]. They find blood but no corpses in the courtyard of the castle. Going deeper into the dark castle, they stumble upon acting [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Eddison Tollett]] and the survivors of the [[Night's Watch]].

[[File:Ned-Umber-Whit.png|thumb|A reanimated Ned is burned by Beric.]]
The combined group finds Ned Umber dead inside the castle, pinned against the castle walls with a group of severed limbs in a spiral formation around his body. Beric deduces that it is a message sent by the [[Night King]]. Tormund notes that, with them at Last Hearth, the army of the dead is between them and [[Winterfell]], and they will have a difficult time giving chase on foot. Edd says that his own group rode from [[Castle Black]] and they can double up on the horses. While Tormund is turned around, the dead Ned Umber reanimates as a wight and slashes at Tormund with a knife, emitting a terrifying screech. Beric quickly burns the wight with his flaming sword, and the entire spiral symbol is lit on fire.<ref name=":0" />

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, no equivalent battle has occurred. The TV show has surpassed the timeline of the books, so it is unclear if an equivalent battle will occur.
