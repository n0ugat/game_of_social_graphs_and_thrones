==Synopsis==
===In King's Landing===
[[File:Stark party 1x03.png|thumb|The Stark party arrives in King's Landing.]]
The royal party reaches [[King's Landing]]. Almost immediately, [[Eddard Stark|Lord Eddard Stark]] is asked to attend a meeting of the king's [[Small Council]] and to change his clothes, but he refuses to the latter. Before that he encounters [[Jaime Lannister]] in the throne room. Jaime is still unhappy that Eddard judged him dishonorable for killing the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], the murderer of Eddard's [[Rickard Stark|father]] and [[Brandon Stark|brother]], and for having the nerve to casually seat himself upon the Iron Throne after mayhem was through. Jaime is unrepentant about it. Eddard meets the council members: Lord [[Petyr Baelish|Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish]], the king's [[Master of Coin]] and a friend of Eddard's wife from childhood; [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]], the king's adviser in all matters scientific and academic; Lord [[Renly Baratheon]], the younger of the king's two brothers and [[Master of Laws]]; and [[Varys]], a [[eunuch]] and the [[Master of Whisperers]] (the head of the king's intelligence network).

Varys tells Eddard that the council members heard about his "troubles on the Kingsroad" and that they pray for [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s recovery. Eddard grimly responds "It's a shame no one prayed for the [[Mycah|butcher's boy]]", which visibly upsets Varys.

Eddard is stunned to learn that the crown is six million [[Money|gold dragons]] in debt, half of which is to Lord [[Tywin Lannister]]. To make matters worse, [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]] has just ordered a lavish [[tournament]] to celebrate Eddard's appointment. He resolves to advise Robert to cancel the tournament, but the council is doubtful that the king will listen.

[[File:Cersei-joffrey.png|thumb|Cersei and her son Joffrey.]]
[[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]] talks to [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] about the incident on the river. She tells him that when he is king, the truth will be whatever he decides it will be. Joffrey thinks there will be trouble with the Starks, and promises that when he is king, he will double their taxes, force them to contribute to a standing army and, should they object, crush them and install someone loyal, such as his great-uncle [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], as [[Warden of the North]]. Cersei points out that the [[North]] is too vast and wild to be militarily conquered by outsiders, and a king needs to be more clever. She also advises him to be kind to his betrothed [[Sansa Stark]] to avoid stirring up trouble for later, and concludes that "Anyone who isn't [[House Lannister|us]] is an enemy."

[[Arya Stark|Arya]] and Sansa are still at odds over the incident with Joffrey and [[Nymeria (direwolf)|her direwolf]]. Eddard explains to Arya that Sansa was put in a difficult position by the king and queen, and while she shouldn't have lied, winning the long-term approval of Joffrey, her future husband, was important. Arya is unhappy with the situation, but Eddard mollifies her by allowing her to practice with her sword, [[Needle]].

[[File:Catelyn-arrive.png|thumb|Catelyn and Rodrik arrive in King's Landing.]][[Catelyn Stark]] and Ser [[Rodrik Cassel|Rodrik]] arrive at King's Landing and attempt to sneak into the city, but are spotted by one of Littlefinger's men. They are taken to meet Littlefinger at a brothel he owns, where Lord Varys is also waiting. He explains that one of his 'little birds' told him they were coming. Catelyn is angered by the way they've been treated, but asks Littlefinger for aid in finding the people who tried to have Bran killed. Littlefinger is able to answer this quickly stating that the [[Valyrian steel dagger|elaborate dagger]] wielded by the [[Catspaw|assassin]] used to be his, but he lost it in a gamble with [[Tyrion Lannister]].

[[File:Eddard and Petyr 1x03.png|thumb|Eddard threatens Lord Baelish.]]
Littlefinger fetches Eddard to meet his wife, but Eddard suspects a trick and pushes Littlefinger up against a wall outside the brothel wanting to know what his game is. Catelyn then appears, and Eddard is pacified. After hearing her news, he vows to find the truth and expose the Lannisters to Robert. Littlefinger agrees to be his ally in this, for the affection he once bore Catelyn as a youngster.

Ravens arrive at King's Landing with news of Bran's recovery. Cersei fears he will expose their secret, but Jaime comforts her, confident they can outwit a child if need be.

[[File:Jaime & Cersei 1x03.png|thumb|Jaime comforts Cersei.]]
Elsewhere, Robert swaps old war stories with Ser [[Barristan Selmy]], a distinguished and famous knight and the commander of the [[Kingsguard]]. Summoning Jaime Lannister, Robert jokingly questions him about Aerys Targaryen's death, wondering if the Mad King died begging for mercy, but Jaime rather coldly replies that the master he betrayed died screaming the same words he'd been saying since the siege of King's Landing began: "Burn them all".

Eddard has contracted a swordmaster, [[Syrio Forel]], the former [[First Sword of Braavos]], to teach Arya how to use her sword properly. Arya is thrilled, and [[Water dance|'the dance']] begins. As Eddard watches them practice, his pleasure at seeing Arya happy sours when he realizes that a conflict between the Starks and Lannisters may be inevitable; his daughter may well be training herself for war.

=== At Winterfell ===
[[File:Bran and Old Nan 1x02.jpg|thumb|Old Nan tells Bran of winter and the Long Night.]]
At [[Winterfell]], [[Bran Stark|Bran]] has awoken but has no memory of his accident. His injuries have left him bedridden and unlikely to walk again. [[Old Nan]], the oldest servant in the castle, tells Bran stories to pass the time, but he doesn't want her usual heroic stories about the likes of Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]. She instead speaks of the [[White Walkers]] and the coming of a [[Long Night|vast winter that will blanket the world]]. When [[Robb Stark|Robb]] pays a visit, Bran asks his brother if it is true that he will never walk again. Robb reluctantly says this is so. Bran remarks that he would rather be dead.

=== At the Wall ===
At [[Castle Black]], the primary redoubt of the [[Night's Watch]] in the shadow of the [[Wall]], [[Jon Snow]] shows his worth to the trainer, Ser [[Alliser Thorne]], by besting several fellow members of the Watch in the practice yard. Thorne is disgusted at the poor performance of the others but has no praise for Jon either, dubbing him Lord Snow and describing him as "the ''least useless person here"''. Watching over the new recruits with [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]], Tyrion notes Thorne's stern and unusual ways, but Jeor doesn't care as he only requires Thorne to turn the "thieves and runaways" into men of the Night's Watch. Later on, several of the other recruits gang up on Jon, but the situation is defused by Tyrion. Tyrion points out to Jon that none of the other recruits had the benefit of a skilled master-at-arms to train them, and that Jon is alienating them through his standoffish attitude and superior combat skills.

[[File:Jon and Benjen 1x03.png|thumb|Benjen talks with Jon on the Wall.]]
[[Benjen Stark]] meets Jon atop the Wall and tells him he is going on a ranging in the [[Haunted Forest]]. He refuses to take Jon with him, telling him he isn't ready, and that here rank and nobility mean nothing. Every man must earn everything he gets. Before departing, Benjen stops by the eating area to say farewell to [[Yoren]], a fellow Night's Watchman who scouts for new recruits in the capital. Benjen also scolds Tyrion for his naivety regarding what is north of the Wall and states that Tyrion has no authority to say what is or isn't beyond the Wall as he hasn't been out there himself.

Later, Tyrion discusses north of the Wall with Jeor Mormont and his chief adviser, the ancient and blind [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]]. Jeor asks for Tyrion to intercede at court and get the Watch more men as they are dangerously undermanned. Aemon warns that the Stark words are right. Winter is coming. It will be more harsh and terrible than any in living memory. More dangerous things than just [[Free Folk|wildlings]] might come with it. After all, [[Will|one of their number]] swore that the White Walkers had returned ... right up to the moment Ned Stark cut his head off. Tyrion admits his skepticism that supernatural creatures might exist, but he agrees to bring word to his queen.

Before departing for King's Landing, Tyrion fulfills an old ambition by climbing to the top of the Wall and urinating off the edge of it. He and Jon share a moment of fellowship before Tyrion departs for the capital in the company of Yoren.

===In the Dothraki Sea===
[[File:Daenerys 1x03.png|thumb|Daenerys rides with the ''khalasar''.]]
[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] commands the ''[[khalasar]]'' to halt on a whim, exercising her growing authority and power. [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] does not take well to being commanded and threatens his sister, whereupon he is lassoed around the neck by [[Rakharo]], a [[Dothraki]] warrior wielding a whip. Daenerys calms the situation and Viserys is forced to walk, a sign of shame amongst the horse-riding Dothraki. Later, [[Irri]] reveals to Daenerys that Daenerys is pregnant. Daenerys relays the news to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]] and tells him she thinks it will be a boy as they lie naked in each other's arms. Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] and Rakharo compare the [[Westeros]]i and Dothraki ways of battle: the heavily-armored but slow knights, with longswords good for piercing armor, versus the lightly-armored but fast-moving horse-warriors. Jorah has heard of Rakharo's father, a great warrior, but admits that he disgraced [[Jeor Mormont|his own father]], a man of great honor. When he learns that Daenerys is pregnant, he announces he must split off from the column to ride to the [[Free Cities|Free City]] of [[Qohor]], but will rejoin them before they reach [[Vaes Dothrak]].

==Quotes==
'''[[Jaime Lannister]]''': "It must be strange for you, coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, [[Brandon Stark|your brother]]. [[Rickard Stark|Your father]] too. They didn't deserve to die like that; nobody deserves to [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|die like that]]."<br />
'''[[Eddard Stark]]''': "But you just stood there and watched."<br />
'''Jaime''': "Five hundred men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms, you think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. Five hundred men and this room was silent as a crypt...except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later, when I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned...it felt like justice."<br />
'''Eddard''': "Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys Targaryen]]'s back?"<br />
'''Jaime''': "Tell me, if I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"<br />
'''Eddard''': "You served him well. When serving was safe."<br />

<hr width="50%" />'''Eddard''': "War was easier than daughters!"

<hr width="50%" />'''[[Daenerys Targaryen]]''': Do the Dothraki buy their slaves?<br />'''[[Jorah Mormont]]''': The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.<br />
'''Daenerys''': From whom?<br />
'''Jorah''': If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices: pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice.<hr width="50%" />'''[[Cersei Lannister]]''': "When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday, you'll sit on the throne, and the truth will be what you make it."<br />
'''[[Joffrey Baratheon]]''': "Do I have to marry her?"<br />
'''Cersei''': "Yes, she's very beautiful, and young...and if you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions, and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses...and if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy, and the world will be exactly as you want it to be."

<hr width="50%" />'''Cersei''': "Everyone who isn't us is an enemy."

<hr width="50%" />'''[[Benjen Stark]]''': "You're no ranger. Here, a man gets what he earns, when he earns it."

<hr width="50%" />'''Jaime''': "I think we can outfox a ten year old."<br />
'''Cersei''': "And my husband?"<br />
'''Jaime''': "I'll go to war with him if I have to...they can write a ballad about us, 'the [[War of the Five Kings|War for Cersei's C***]]'!"<br />
''[Cersei slaps Jaime. He chuckles, and she tries to slap him again, but he grabs her arm and holds her from behind firmly but gently]''<br />
'''Cersei''': ''(annoyed)'' "Let me go..."<br />
'''Jaime''': ''(impassioned)'' "Never."<br />
'''Cersei''': "Let me go..."<br />
'''Jaime''': ''(whispering reassuringly in Cersei's ear)'' "The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him, Ned Stark, the king, the whole bloody lot of them until you and I are the only people left in this world."<br />''(Cersei and Jaime quietly sink into a loving embrace)''

<hr width="50%" />'''[[Robert Baratheon]]''': What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say, when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. ''[Smirks]'' Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?<br />
'''Jaime''': "He just said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... 'Burn them all.'" ''[Robert's smile vanishes.]'' "If that's all, Your Grace."<br />

<hr width="50%" />'''Benjen Stark''': "We've been receiving disturbing reports."<br />
'''[[Jon Snow]]''': "What kind of reports?"<br />
'''Benjen Stark''': "The kind I don't want to believe."<br />

<hr width="50%" />'''[[Aemon|Maester Aemon]]''': The Starks are always right eventually; winter ''is ''coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it...When winter ''does'' come, gods help us all if we're not ready!

==Behind the scenes==
===General===
* The episode takes its title from a mocking nickname given to Jon Snow by Ser [[Alliser Thorne]].
*The soundtrack playing over the credits is a rendition of [[Themes and leitmotifs (Game of Thrones)#Arya's theme|Arya's theme]]. There was no official release for it.
* This episode is dedicated to the memory of [[Margaret John]], who plays Old Nan, and who sadly passed away on 2 February 2011 after a brief illness.
* During the Small Council scene, Renly hands Ned Stark a scroll containing the announcement of the tournament and the prizes for the winners, which he then reads off as "40,000 [[Money|gold dragons]] for the champion, 20,000 for the runner-up, and 20,000 for the best archer". Pycelle then asks if the crown can afford 80,000 Gold Dragons in prize money. If you pause when Ned first unrolls the scroll, its contents are actually clearly legible: it goes on to say that there is a 20,000 Gold Dragon prize for "Combat with Swords and Clubs", which makes for a total tournament debt of 100,000 Gold Dragons. It is unclear why this discrepancy occurred.
* Littlefinger states that the Crown is six million in debt, half of it to Tywin, without specifying to whom the other half is owed. In a [[Walk of Punishment (episode)|later episode]], it is revealed that one of the main creditors of the Crown is the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]].
** In the parallel book scene, Littlefinger states that the Crown owes more than six million gold pieces, and specifies the main creditors: most of the debt is owed to House Lannister, and the rest to the Iron Bank, the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]], several [[Tyrosh]]i trading cartels (together), and the Faith.{{Bookref|AGOT|20}} In the fourth novel, it is revealed that the debt to the Faith is nearly one million.{{Bookref|AFFC|28}}
**It is doubtful Robert could have spent so much money in fifteen years, even with all his entertainments. In "[[Walk of Punishment (episode)|Walk of Punishment]]", [[Bronn]] suggests that Littlefinger might have embezzled the treasury; if Bronn's speculation is correct, it could be an additional motive for the [[Assassination of Jon Arryn]] - to prevent him from inspecting the ledgers.
*The [[Dothraki (language)|Dothraki]] word that Irri is heard teaching Daenerys, "''athjahakar''", is the Dothraki word for "pride". It is derived from "''jahak''", the long braid worn by Dothraki warriors which they take great pride in, as they only cut their braids when defeated.
*When the [[Royal Steward]] greets Eddard Stark and says that Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council, the steward mispronounces "maester" as "my-stir"; the correct pronunciation is actually "may-stir". This was reportedly a common mistake on set which took the cast some time to get right.
*When Joffrey complains to Cersei that every lord in the realm commands his own soldiers raised from his feudal lands, he comments that he feels this is primitive, "no better than the [[Hill tribes]]." This is the first mention of the hill tribes of the [[Mountains of the Moon]] which ring the [[Vale of Arryn]], though they won't be encountered on-screen until two episodes after this, in "[[The Wolf and the Lion]]".
*Joffrey also mentions "uncle Kevan": [[Kevan Lannister]] first appears on-screen five episodes from this in "[[The Pointy End]]". Of course, Joffrey is speaking loosely, as Kevan is actually his mother's uncle and therefore his great-uncle (it's common in real-life to refer to great-uncles as just "uncle").
*[[Old Nan]] offers to tell Bran a story about Ser [[Duncan the Tall]]. This is the first time in the show Duncan, also known as "Dunk", is mentioned; he is one of the main characters in the ''Tales of Dunk and Egg'' prequel novellas, which take place 89 years before the events of ''Game of Thrones'' (there are time skips between novellas in the series, and George R.R. Martin has said that he wants to continue them all the way up to the deaths of the characters, about 50 years before ''Game of Thrones''). Ser Duncan visited Winterfell in one of his adventures, and it is speculated that Old Nan met him in her youth.
*The scene between Robert, Barristan, and Jaime, the scene between Tyrion, Yoren, and Benjen, and the scene between Jorah, Rakharo and Irri were written at the last minute because the rough-cut of the episode was running short, and filmed in post-production re-shoots. Note that all of these scenes are interior shots which didn't need to be filmed on-location.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/04/ask-a-got-writer-bryan-cogman-on-the-writing-process-robb-and-talisa-and-renlys-peach/ Bryan Cogman Q&A], WinterIsComing.net, April 24, 2013.</ref>
*Robert says that he killed a Tarly at the [[Battle of Summerhall]]. According to the books, the Tarlys did not participate in that battle; instead, they fought against Robert (and defeated him) in the [[Battle of Ashford]].
*It is never revealed in the show who sent the assassin to kill Bran and who is the real owner of the dagger. In ''A Clash of Kings'' Catelyn is told to whom Littlefinger lost the dagger;{{Bookref|ACOK|55}} in ''A Storm of Swords'' two characters figure out, based on circumstantial evidence, who sent the assassin.{{Bookref|ASOS|60}}{{Bookref|ASOS|72}}
**For full information, see the articles about the "''[[Valyrian steel dagger#In the books|Valyrian steel dagger]]''" and "''[[Catspaw#In the books|Catspaw]]''".
*Since Jaime and Cersei are not POV characters in the first novel, their conversation in this episode about Bran does not occur on-screen in the novels; it is mentioned in a flashback in ''A Storm of Swords'', when Jaime becomes a POV character.
*This is the first episode in which no deaths occurred.
**It is also the only episode in this season with no deaths.
***This makes it also the first episode without deaths before the start of the War of Five Kings.

===Commentary===
Actors Isaac Hempstead Wright, Maisie Williams, and Sophie Turner provide an audio commentary for the episode on the DVD and Blu-ray releases.

* The young actors sing along with the main theme during the title sequence.
* Sean Bean was noted by the younger actors for secreting chocolate bars on his person and sneaking them to his young co-stars during filming.
* Conleth Hill apparently enjoyed trying to put Sophie Turner off during her close-ups.
* English-accented Sophie Turner and Irish-accented Jack Gleeson would imitate one another's accents for amusement between takes.
* Isaac Hempstead Wright's only scene with Jack Gleeson was a mock battle scene in the pilot, where Bran and Tommen have a mock fight while Joffrey and Robb watch on (this scene occurred in the book). This was not used in the final episode.
* The argument between Arya and Sansa at the breakfast table was Sophie Turner's first scene filmed for the first season. Maisie Williams dented the table with the knife so badly it had to be rotated several times to hide the marks from the camera.
* Mark Addy spooked one of the horses in the king's arrival scene in the first episode with his laugh, while he was talking to Isaac Hempstead Wright.
* Mark Addy's prosthetic beard was apparently easily removable so he could eat lunch without ruining it.
* Eugene Simon taught Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner some magic tricks between takes.
* Emilia Clarke was allowed to pick one of four horses for Daenerys's use in the series.
* Harry Lloyd was responsible for introducing the [[wikipedia:iPhone|iPhone]] game ''[[wikipedia:Fruit Ninja|Fruit Ninja]]'' to the cast. It went on to become a craze on set, with cast and crew competing to see who could get the highest score.
* Joseph Mawle told Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner that if acting was easy, everyone would be doing it, so not to be worried if they found scenes hard because the producers had reasons for choosing them and they would be able to do the job.
* The producers considered asking Miltos Yerolemou to shave his hair off to match the appearance of Syrio Forel in the books, but decided he looked better with his hair. Author George R.R. Martin himself would later say in another Season 1 commentary that he didn't care about such minor differences, being more concerned with the satisfying performance of the actor.
