The '''Great Houses'''{{Ref|GOT104}} are the most powerful of the [[noble house]]s of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. They exercise immense authority and power over their vassals and territories and are answerable only to the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men]], with the exception of [[House Stark]], which rules over [[North|an independent kingdom]].

Before [[Aegon's Conquest]], each of the Seven Kingdoms was ruled independently by a powerful royal family. During the Conquest these families were either destroyed, replaced, or defeated and made to swear allegiance to King [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]], who reigned from the [[Iron Throne]] in [[King's Landing]].

The [[House Gardener|Gardeners]], [[House Hoare|Hoares]], and [[House Durrandon|Durrandons]] were slain and replaced by the [[House Tyrell|Tyrells]], [[House Greyjoy|Greyjoys]], and [[House Baratheon|Baratheons]] respectively, while the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]], [[House Arryn|Arryns]], and [[House Stark|Starks]] surrendered peacefully and were allowed to remain in control of their lands. In addition, Aegon raised up the [[House Tully|Tullys]] to rule over the [[Riverlands]], which had been under [[Ironborn]] occupation prior to his arrival. Only [[House Martell]] of [[Dorne]] resisted his armies, but was later brought into the fold through a peaceful marriage-alliance some two centuries later.

Each Great House has a large number of [[Noble house|vassal houses]] serving it, most of whom in turn have smaller vassals under them, extending all the way down to farmers and landed [[Knighthood|knights]]. Each Great House rules over its territory and is responsible for collecting taxes and, in times of war, raising troops to fight for the king. Otherwise they are largely left to operate autonomously to simplify the bureaucracy and governance of the realm.

[[Robert's Rebellion]] ended in the exile of the last Targaryens, with House Baratheon replacing them on the Iron Throne, forming the royal cadet branch [[House Baratheon of King's Landing]].

The [[War of the Five Kings]], along with the [[Last War]], has seen changes amongst the Great Houses. House Baratheon is no longer the royal house, and two of it's branches have become extinct, House Tyrell is also extinct, and has been succeeded by [[Bronn's house|Bronn's unnamed house]]. The Riverlands and the titles of House Tully, which is also near extinction, defeated in the war and exiled, have been given to its usurping former vassals [[House Frey]], though the other Tully vassals remain opposed to the Freys, whose male line has, meanwhile, been effectively wiped out, allowing the Tullys to reclaim their position. With the coronation of Queen [[Cersei Lannister]], the [[Crownlands]] was held by [[House Lannister]], the new royal house after the legal extinction of the Baratheons (though after the legitimization of [[Gendry Baratheon]] by Queen [[Daenerys Targaryen]], House Baratheon has been restored). Although scattered early in the war and stripped of lands and titles, House Stark has regained control of the [[North]] through the [[Battle of the Bastards|defeat]] of its usurping vassals [[House Bolton]], and later gained independence. After the [[battle of King's Landing]], the Lannisters' brief reign as Royal House ended, and once again, they only rule the Westerlands. However, the Lannisters face an uncertain future, with all but [[Tyrion Lannister|one of them]] dead, and their gold mines depleted.

==The Great Houses==
===Current Great Houses===
*{{COA|Bronn's house|inline}} '''[[Bronn's house]]''' - rulers of the [[Reach]] from the castle of [[Highgarden]]. Its current head is [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Bronn|Bronn of the Blackwater]], who founded the house upon being made [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]] with the extinction of [[House Tyrell]]. The official name of the house is unknown.
*{{COA|House Arryn|inline}} '''[[House Arryn]]''' - rulers of the [[Vale of Arryn]] from the castle of the [[Eyrie]]. It was integrated with the [[North|Kingdom of the North]] until [[King in the North|King]] [[Jon Snow]] abdicated. Its current head is [[Defender of the Vale|Lord]] [[Robin Arryn]], who is also the only current member.
*{{COA|House Baratheon|inline}} '''[[House Baratheon]]''' - rulers of the [[Stormlands]] from the castle of [[Storm's End]]. The former royal house of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] after [[Robert's Rebellion]]. The bloodline went extinct after [[Stannis Baratheon]] was killed at the [[battle in the ice]]. Legally went extinct when [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Tommen Baratheon]] killed himself in [[King's Landing]] after the [[destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]]. Restored when [[King|Queen]] [[Daenerys Targaryen]] legitimized Robert's unacknowledged bastard son [[Gendry Baratheon]].
*{{COA|House Greyjoy|inline}} '''[[House Greyjoy]]''' - rulers of the [[Iron Islands]] from the castle of [[Pyke]]. Its leadership was disputed by [[King of the Iron Islands|King]] [[Euron Greyjoy]] and claimant [[King of the Iron Islands|Queen]] [[Yara Greyjoy]]. However, following the [[Battle of King's Landing]], and with Euron's death at the hands of Ser [[Jaime Lannister]], Yara is now the head of the house.
*{{COA|House Lannister|inline}} '''[[House Lannister]]''' - rulers of the [[Westerlands]] from the castle of [[Casterly Rock]]. The former royal house of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] after the [[destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]] until the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. Its leadership was disputed by [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen]] [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei I Lannister]] and [[Hand of the King|Hand of the Queen]] to [[Daenerys Targaryen]], [[Lordship|Lord]] [[Tyrion Lannister]], who became the head of House Lannister after the Battle of [[King's Landing]].
*{{COA|House Martell|inline}} '''[[House Martell]]''' - rulers of [[Dorne]] from the castle of [[Sunspear]]. Deposed by [[Ellaria Sand]] and [[Obara Sand|three]] [[Tyene Sand|of]] [[Nymeria Sand|the]] [[Sand Snakes]] in their [[Coup in Dorne|coup]]. The new [[Prince of Dorne (Last War)|Prince of Dorne]] retook control over Dorne after Ellaria's [[Assault on the Targaryen fleet|defeat]].
*{{COA|House Stark|inline}} '''[[House Stark]]''' - rulers of the [[North]] from the castle of [[Winterfell]] and the royal house of the independent [[North|Kingdom of the North]]. Retook their lands from [[House Bolton]], who usurped House Stark at the [[Red Wedding]], after the [[Battle of the Bastards]]. The house is ruled by [[Sansa Stark]], the [[King in the North|Queen in the North]]. The heir is [[Prince]]ss [[Arya Stark]].
*{{COA|House Tully|inline}} '''[[House Tully]]''' - rulers of the [[Riverlands]] from their seat at [[Riverrun]]. Riverrun was under Frey and Lannister control until [[Daenerys Targaryen]] overthrew [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen]] [[Cersei Lannister]] in the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. [[Lord of Riverrun|Lord]] [[Edmure Tully]] was restored to his former positions sometime after [[Arya Stark]] [[Assassinations at the Twins|assassinated]] all the males of House Frey.

===Former Great Houses===
*{{COA|House Frey|inline}} '''[[House Frey]]''' - former vassals to [[House Tully]], rulers of the [[Riverlands]] from the castle of [[Riverrun]] after usurping their positions as a result of the [[Red Wedding]]. [[Lord of Riverrun|Lord]] [[Walder Frey]] and his male descendants were [[Assassinations at the Twins|murdered]] by [[Arya Stark]], leaving its lordship uncertain and briefly descending the [[Riverlands]] into anarchy, until [[House Lannister|Lannister]] soldiers were sent to maintain order. While House Frey survived Arya Stark's massacre, particularly through Walder Frey's many daughters and other female descendants, it is no longer a Great House following [[Edmure Tully]]'s restoration as [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]].
*{{COA|House Royce|inline}} '''[[House Royce]]''' - at the time of the [[coming of the Andals]] about 6,000 years ago, the lords of the Vale united behind [[Robar II Royce]], proclaiming him as their High King. Robar's rule of the Vale would prove brief, as the Vale was shortly thereafter conquered by the Andal knight Ser [[Artys Arryn]], whose descendants, [[House Arryn]], has ruled the Vale ever since.

===Extinct Great Houses===
Nine Great Houses have gone extinct, three of which were as a result of their defeat in [[Aegon's Conquest]], four of which as a result of the [[War of the Five Kings]]:

*{{COA|House Casterly|inline}} '''[[House Casterly]]''' - rulers of the [[Westerlands]] until they were swayed away from their home by the legendary trickster [[Lann the Clever]], the founder of [[House Lannister]].
*{{COA|House Mudd|inline}} '''[[House Mudd]]''' - rulers of the [[Riverlands]] until their bloodline was extinguished by [[Andals|Andal]] [[Coming of the Andals|invaders]].
*{{COA|House Justman|inline}} '''[[House Justman]]''' - rulers of the [[Riverlands]] until they were exterminated by [[House Durrandon]].
*{{COA|House Hoare|inline}} '''[[House Hoare]]''' - rulers of the [[Iron Islands]] and (through conquest) the [[Riverlands]]. After their defeat, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] commanded the [[Ironborn]] to select a new family from among their number to rule over the rest, under the Targaryens. They selected [[House Greyjoy]].
*{{COA|House Durrandon|inline}} '''[[House Durrandon]]''' - rulers of the [[Stormlands]]. [[Orys Baratheon]], the founder of [[House Baratheon]], married the [[Argella Baratheon|daughter]] of the last king of House Durrandon, thus House Baratheon descends from the Durrandons through the female line.
*{{COA|House Gardener|inline}} '''[[House Gardener]]''' - rulers of the [[Reach]]. [[House Tyrell]] claims descent from House Gardener through the female line, and [[House Florent]] is actually a cadet branch of House Gardener, with a better claim to rule based on lineage than the Tyrells. Several other Houses from the Reach also descend from House Gardener.
*{{COA|House Baratheon of Dragonstone|inline}} '''[[House Baratheon of Dragonstone]]''' - rulers of the [[Stormlands]] from the castle of [[Dragonstone]], claiming the [[Iron Throne]]. Extinct as of the [[battle in the ice]] and the death of claimant [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Stannis Baratheon]].
*{{COA|House Baratheon of King's Landing|inline}} '''[[House Baratheon of King's Landing]]''' - rulers of the [[Crownlands]] from the castle of the [[Red Keep]] in [[King's Landing]], and the former royal house. Extinct as of King Tommen's suicide following the destruction of the [[Great Sept of Baelor]].
*{{COA|House Bolton|inline}} '''[[House Bolton]]''' - former vassals to [[House Stark]], rulers of the [[North]] from the castle of [[Winterfell]] after usurping their positions from House Stark during the [[Red Wedding]]. [[Ramsay Bolton]], the sole heir, was killed in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Bastards]] by his own [[Bastard's girls|hounds]], rendering the house extinct.
*{{COA|House Tyrell|inline}} '''[[House Tyrell]]''' - rulers of the [[Reach]] from the castle of [[Highgarden]] after the extinction of House Gardener. The bloodline is wiped out as a result of the [[destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor]] and the [[Sack of Highgarden]].
*{{COA|House Targaryen|inline}} '''[[House Targaryen]]''' - the former royal house of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] since [[Aegon's Conquest]]. Overthrown in [[Robert's Rebellion]], but restored following the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. After [[Jon Snow]] rejoined the [[Night's Watch]], House Targaryen became legally extinct. The bloodline of House Targaryen lives in House Baratheon and House Martell.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the term "great house" or "ruling house" is used informally. Author [[George R.R. Martin]] has said that in retrospect he should have used a formal senior rank to differentiate the ruling houses from their vassals.

Keeping in mind that Martin has said that Westeros is roughly the size of the continent of South America, the realm known as "the Seven Kingdoms" spans an area on the scale of the Roman Empire. Thus in terms of their populations and the size of the armies they can raise in wartime, each of the "Great Houses" is more comparable in scale to a real-life medieval kingship like England or France than a smaller dukedom. Provinces (in this case, constituent regions) are in effect semi-autonomous with the local people regarding the local Great House as their rulers, and the King as perhaps an abstract and distant figure who has no bearing on their day-to-day lives.

The definition of a "Great House" in general can be summarized as any noble House that bends the knee directly to the Iron Throne and rules one of constituent regions of the realm. The royal family itself rules the Crownlands directly, loosely making it another Great House, though technically it ranks higher than all the others. At the start of the books this list comprises the Starks, Lannisters, Arryns, Greyjoys, Tullys, Tyrells, Baratheons of Storm's End, and Martells. This definition sometimes leads to oddities, for example, [[House Hightower]] of [[Oldtown]] commands a vastly populous city (second only to [[King's Landing]] and not by much) and an immense area of territory around it, including numerous smaller vassal houses. The Hightowers could theoretically be more powerful than the ruling Great House of less populous regions (such as the Greyjoys and perhaps even the Martells), but as they are vassals of the Tyrells, they are not counted as a Great House.

Few Great Houses have ever gone extinct. By the time the books begin, only three former Great Houses have ever been destroyed, all during [[Aegon's Conquest]], three hundred years before the War of the Five Kings:

*[[House Durrandon]] - rulers of the Stormlands.
*[[House Gardener]] - rulers of the Reach.
*[[House Hoare]] - rulers of the Iron Islands and (through conquest) the Riverlands.

After the Targaryen Conquest, House Baratheon replaced the Storm Kings of House Durrandon, House Tyrell replaced House Gardener, and House Greyjoy replaced House Hoare. [[Orys Baratheon]], the founder of House Baratheon, married the daughter of the last Storm King, so there was some continuity with the former House and its replacement. House Durrandon left no other known branches besides the Baratheons.
House Gardener intermarried with many of the great noble families of the Reach, and [[House Florent]] is even a cadet branch of the main Gardener line. House Tyrell descends from House Gardener through the female line (much to the consternation of the Florents), so there is some continuity in the Reach as well. 
Thus, by the time of Robert's Rebellion, the Reach is the only region of Westeros which has noble Houses with rival claims to rule based on descent.

When [[Harren Hoare]] and all of his sons were roasted alive by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]'s dragons, he had the ironborn choose one of their own Houses to rule over them (under the overall rule of the Targaryens), and they chose House Greyjoy. The Iron Islands are actually something of an odd case, in that for many centuries [[King of the Iron Islands|their kingship]] was not hereditary. When a king died, the powerful noble Houses of the Iron Islands would meet in an assembly known as a Kingsmoot to select a new king to rule over all of them. Five thousand years ago, House Greyiron killed all of the representatives at the last Kingsmoot, and ruled the Iron Islands as hereditary kings for a thousand years. The Greyirons were destroyed four thousand years ago during the [[coming of the Andals]], when they were deposed by House Hoare. Whether the Greyirons should be considered a Great House that early in history is unclear.

House Hoare officially went extinct when Harren died, but it only went extinct in the male-line. House Volmark, an ironborn noble family from [[Harlaw]], descends from House Hoare through the female line (much as [[House Tyrell]] descends from the officially extinct [[House Gardener]] through the female line). House Volmark never had particularly strong claim against House Greyjoy, however, due to a combination of that the ironborn are very misogynistic and don't place much value on female-line descent, and because of the unusual elected-kingship customs of the Iron Islands.

Nonetheless, no noble House from the Iron Islands can claim a better right to rule than House Greyjoy based on descent: multiple houses from the Iron Islands, including House Greyjoy, possess ancestors who were kings, but during the time of the non-hereditary kingship based on elections in the kingsmoot. Moreover, the Greyjoys were at least briefly kings during the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], so by the time of the War of the Five Kings, they are still held in very high esteem by the ironborn. Thus the situation in the Reach is still unique, with other noble Houses besides the current Great House possessing claims to rule based on descent, and specifically House Florent actually has a better claim than House Tyrell based on descent.

In ancient times, other royal Houses included House Greyiron in the Iron Islands, House Mudd - whose domain was located along the [[Blue Fork]] of the [[Trident]] and ruled as Kings of the Rivers and the Hills, House Fisher - which also ruled the Riverlands as River Kings, House Teague also in the Riverlands, and [[House Casterly]] in the [[Westerlands]]. However, given that at that time almost every castle in Westeros commanded a kingdom and almost every lord (great or not) called himself a king, it is unclear whether or not these houses should truly be called "Great".

It is notable that, in the books, House Frey was never made a great house: they were awarded Riverrun but not the power that comes with it, and Harrenhal was made the new seat of power in the Riverlands (making House Baelish the de jure Great House of this region). When [[Jaime Lannister]] arrives at the second siege of Riverrun (depicted in Season 6 of the TV series), in the books he is disgusted with the Freys and slights them by explicitly pointing out that they ''were not'' named the new Lords Paramount of the Riverlands, technically Littlefinger holds the title. Nevertheless, the Freys ''functionally'' claim authority over Riverlands, exploiting Petyr Baelish's lack of attention to his new lands.
