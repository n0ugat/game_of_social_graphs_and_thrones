'''Marsh King'''{{Ref|H&L303}} was the title held by the [[crannogmen]] rulers of the [[Neck]] before the region was conquered by [[House Stark]]. To cement the annexation of the Neck to the [[North|Kingdom of the North]], the daughter of the last Marsh King married the [[King in the North]]. Afterward, [[House Reed]] began to rule the Neck as bannermen of House Stark.<ref>"[[House Reed (short)|House Reed]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the last Marsh King was defeated by King [[Rickard Stark (son of Jon)|Rickard Stark]], son of King Jon Stark. This was of course, not the same "[[Rickard Stark]]" who was later the father of [[Eddard Stark]]: names often repeat in dynasties and many Starks throughout history have been named Rickard.
