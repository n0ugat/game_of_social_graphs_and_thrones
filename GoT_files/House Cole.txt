==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the status of House Cole is uncertain. During the time span of the events described in the novels, there are two known characters whose surname is Cole:
*Dick Cole, an exile serving with the [[Golden Company]].
*Will Cole, an exile serving with the Golden Company.
It is uncertain whether the aforementioned Dick and Will actually belong to House Cole, because in the free companies a man can call himself whatever he chooses. It is also not stated whether they are related to each other.
