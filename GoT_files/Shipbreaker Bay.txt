'''Shipbreaker Bay'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is a body of water located off the south-eastern coast of [[Westeros]]. It is an inlet of the [[Narrow Sea]], running along the eastern coast of the [[Stormlands]], separating the mainland from the island of [[Tarth]]. The bay is noted for its severe, frequent storms. [[House Baratheon]]'s ancestral castle, [[Storm's End]], is located on the bay.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels Shipbreaker Bay is named for the hundreds, if not thousands, of ships that have been wrecked in storms along its shores. Most notably, the parents of [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]], [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]] were killed in a shipwreck close to Storm's End twenty years before the events of the series.

As well as Storm's End, the castles of [[Griffin's Roost]], [[Rain House]], and [[Evenfall Hall]] are located along the coast of the bay.
