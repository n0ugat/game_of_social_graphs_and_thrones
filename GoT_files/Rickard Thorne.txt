Ser '''Rickard Thorne''' is a [[Knighthood|knight]] of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] of [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Rickard is a member of [[House Thorne]], a [[noble house]] from the [[Crownlands]]. After [[Criston Cole|Criston]] is appointed [[Hand of the King]], Rickard becomes [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s new sworn protector.{{Ref|HOTD203}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===

[[File:OT2 Alicent & Kingsguard 2.png|thumb|250px|Ser Rickard escorts Alicent away from the crowds. ]]
Rickard is on attendance to Alicent and Queen [[Helaena Targaryen]], praying at the Grand Sept, when a [[Riot in King's Landing|riot]] erupts close by, caused by public anger at food shortages due to the [[Velaryon fleet]]'s [[blockade of the Gullet]] and support for Rhaenyra amongst the smallfolk after she despatched shipments of food from Dragonstone to help the starving populace. Rickard ushers the queens from the sept back to their wheelhouse, but when his fellow Kingsguard [[Leon Estermont]] hacks the hand off a man reaching for Alicent, the outraged crowd's mood turns violent. Rickard, at Alicent's command, orders his fellow Kingsguard to sheathe their swords in a futile effort to avoid enraging the mob further, and puts himself between Alicent, Helaena and the crowd, leaving his fellow Kingsguards Estermont, [[Martyn Reyne]], and [[Eddard Waters]] to be surrounded and torn apart by the mob. Having secured Alicent and Helaena in the royal wheelhouse, Rickard orders the driver to get them back to the [[Red Keep]].{{Ref|HOTD206}}

Rickard accompanies Alicent to the [[Kingswood]] as she contemplates how her life turned out.{{Ref|HOTD207}}

Rickard informs Alicent and Helaena of [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]]'s return from [[Sharp Point]].{{Ref|HOTD208}}
