The '''Merling King'''{{Ref|HOTD107}} is a [[Religion|deity]] associated with the sea. As such, he is popular among sailors.{{Ref|H&L512}} [[House Velaryon]], traditionally a family of sailors and admirals, ceremonially commit their dead to the Merling King by funerals at sea.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

The [[spears of the merling king]], a group of rocky islets and seamounts in [[Blackwater Bay]], are named for him.

The [[Faceless Men]] consider the Merling King an aspect of the [[Many-Faced God]].{{Ref|H&L512}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Merling King is a local deity mentioned in legends of several lands around the [[Narrow Sea]]. He is one of many deities who has a statue in the [[House of Black and White]], along with gods from all other known religions with dominion over death, and is most commonly visited by sailors. [[File:Driftwood Throne 2.png|thumb|[[Driftwood Throne]] supposedly gifted to [[House Velaryon]] by the Merling King.]]''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' mentions that [[House Velaryon]] believes they were granted the [[Driftwood Throne]] by the Merling King to conclude a pact.

The legends of the Merling King might be a cultural/folklore remnant of the ancient religion the [[First Men]] followed when they first came to [[Westeros]], before they converted to follow the religion of the [[Old Gods|old gods]]. Several different ancient kingdoms of the First Men have a pairing between two primary deities, one of the sea and one of the sky and winds:
*The [[ironborn]], who branched off from the First Men in ancient times, follow the religion of the [[Drowned God]], who is opposed by his enemy the [[Storm God]]. 
*[[Durran Godsgrief]] was the legendary founder of [[House Durrandon]] (and through the female line, ancestor of [[House Baratheon]]) who built the mighty castle [[Storm's End]]. The tales say that he fell in love with and stole away [[Elenei]] to be his wife, the daughter of the sea god and the goddess of the wind.  
*Another somewhat isolated enclave of the First Men were the inhabitants of the [[Three Sisters]], small islands on the eastern side of Westeros from the Iron Islands (and like a smaller scale version of the Iron Isles, they are also infamous pirate dens). It is said that in ancient times, the Sistermen believed in a Lady of the Waves and a Lord of the Skies (switching the genders from the figures in the legend of Durran).
