'''Florence + The Machine''' are an English indie rock band. Their song "{{WPS|Ceremonials (album)|Seven Devils}}" was featured in the "Seven Devils" trailer for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Showrunners [[D.B. Weiss]] and [[David Benioff]] wanted Florence + The Machine to record "[[The Rains of Castamere]]" to play over the end credits of the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second season]] episode "[[Blackwater]]", but the group already had a commitment to performing on the {{WPS|The Great Gatsby: Music from Baz Luhrmann's Film|soundtrack}} of ''{{WPS|The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby}}''.<ref>[http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/game-of-thrones-behind-the-music.html Behind the Music of Game of Thrones]</ref> The song was instead recorded by [[The National]].

Their cover of "[[Jenny of Oldstones (song)|Jenny of Oldstones]]" was featured in the credits of the [[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|second episode]] of the [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|eighth season]].
