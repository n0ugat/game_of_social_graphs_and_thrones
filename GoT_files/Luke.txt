'''Luke''' is a newly made [[Steward (Night's Watch)|Steward]] of the [[Night's Watch]], of the same group of recruits as [[Jon Snow]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Luke is present during the speech [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] gave to the "graduating" recruits. He is assigned to the Stewards. [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] orders him to report to [[One-Eyed Joe]], who is in charge of [[Castle Black]]'s stables.{{Ref|GOT107}}

==In the books==
In the [[A Song of Ice and Fire|''A Song of Ice and Fire'']] novels there is no Steward named Luke or a character assigned to the stables after the "graduation" of Jon's group of recruits. There is, however, a [[ranger]] named Luke, who hails from a town named Longtown.
