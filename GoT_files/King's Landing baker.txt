{{Quote|Go on, piss off!|The baker to Arya Stark|Baelor}}
A '''King's Landing baker''' is a commoner who works at the capital.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
He refuses [[Arya Stark|Arya]]'s efforts to trade a pigeon she has caught for bread, even for stale or burned ones.{{Ref|GOT109}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Arya tries to trade the pigeon to a man selling pies, first asking for lemon, but then any kind. When he refuses, she considers grabbing it and running as the man has a limp, but as there are [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]] patrolling nearby she thinks better of it. Earlier she had been successful in trading pigeons she caught to a pot-shop (apparently as an ingredient in [[Bowl of brown|bowls of brown]]), which in return would give her back half of the pigeon's meat cooked - before this, she had to eat the pigeon meat raw.
