Lord '''Tyrion Lannister''' is the youngest child of [[Lord of Casterly Rock|Lord]] [[Tywin Lannister]] and younger brother of [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and [[Jaime Lannister]]. A [[dwarf]], he uses his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces. He is the current [[Lord of Casterly Rock]] and [[Hand of the King]] to [[Bran Stark|Brandon Stark]]. 

==Biography==
===Background===
{{Quote|You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was [[Tytos Lannister|my father's]] sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn [[Casterly Rock]] into your whorehouse.|[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]'s response when Tyrion asks for Casterly Rock|Valar Dohaeris}}
Tyrion's mother, [[Joanna Lannister]], died giving birth to him, a tragedy which Tywin and Cersei unfairly blame Tyrion for.<ref name="Tyrion viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/jbaratheon/tyrion-lannister/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of King's Landing - Tyrion Lannister entry]</ref>{{Ref|GOT202}}

Tyrion is mocked for being a dwarf, called derisive names such as "Imp" and "Halfman", which he tries to embrace to keep his self esteem up. Had an infant with dwarfism like Tyrion been born a [[Smallfolk|commoner]], he'd have been left in the woods to die; luckily, his birthright as a Lannister afforded him significant wealth and power.{{Ref|GOT102}}

When Tyrion was sixteen, he interrupted the attempted rape of a wheelwright's daughter. While Jaime dispatched the attackers, Tyrion helped the girl, named Tysha, recover. They later became lovers and got married in secret. When Lord Tywin learned what had happened, he payed Tysha, a prostitute, to service every one of his guards while Tyrion watched. Jaime confessed he had orchestrated the attack to help Tyrion lose his virginity.{{Ref|GOT109}}

While two siblings occupied positions of power, Tyrion was put in charge of the sewers at Casterly Rock when he turned of age.{{Ref|GOT208}}

Tyrion spent a lot of time at court in [[King's Landing]] to avoid his father. He got on well with Jaime, his niece [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and nephew [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], but had a colder relationship with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] and the psychopathic [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]].<ref name="Cersei viewers guide">[http://viewers-guide.hbo.com/game-of-thrones/season2/#!/guide/houses/jbaratheon/cersei-baratheon/ HBO viewers guide, season 2 guide to houses, House Baratheon of King's Landing - Cersei Baratheon entry]</ref> Tyrion is committed to the good of both his house, and since Cersei married [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King]] [[Robert Baratheon]], his family's hold on the [[Iron Throne|throne]].<ref name="Tyrion viewers guide" />

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Winter_is_Coming_Tyrion_and_Ros.png|thumb|Tyrion visits a whorehouse upon his arrival in Winterfell.]]
Tyrion accompanies [[King]] [[Robert Baratheon]] to [[Winterfell]], where he makes the acquaintance of a prostitute named [[Ros]], and gives her a Lannister lion necklace. While lingering outside the feast hall, Tyrion meets [[Jon Snow]], [[Eddard Stark]]'s [[bastard]] son and realizes he is something of a kindred spirit. "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes," he explains.{{Ref|GOT101}} Despite time spent in brothels and taverns, Tyrion is well-read, cunning, and has a fondness for social misfits.{{Ref|GOT104}}

[[File:Got11-thumb.jpg|thumb|Tyrion in Winterfell with the Hound.]]

[[File:Tyrion_Lannister.jpg|thumb|Tyrion prepares to leave Winterfell.]]
When Prince Joffrey refuses to pay his respects to Lord and Lady Stark after [[Bran Stark|Bran]]'s fall, Tyrion slaps him until he acquiesces. He then breakfasts with his family, where he says he wants to visit the [[Wall]] and piss off it. He takes interest in Bran's fall, noting carefully his siblings' glum reactions to the news that Bran is likely to live.{{Ref|GOT102}}

On the road to [[Castle Black]], Tyrion explains to Jon that he likes to read as it keeps his wits sharp. Upon reaching the Wall, he is temporarily rendered speechless by the size and scale of the structure.{{Ref|GOT102}} During his stay, Tyrion observes Jon Snow's superior attitude toward his fellow recruits and recommends he help the others train in order to earn their friendship. [[Aemon|Maester Aemon]] and [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] ask Tyrion to use his influence at court to recruit more men for the [[Night's Watch]]. While Tyrion is sympathetic, he doesn't believe in danger beyond the Wall.{{Ref|GOT103}}

[[File:Tyrion_and_Bran_1x04.png|thumb|Tyrion speaks with Bran.]]
Pausing at Winterfell on the trip home, Tyrion gives Bran the blueprint for a custom saddle. At the [[Inn at the Crossroads]], Tyrion is ambushed by [[Catelyn Stark]] and arrested for Bran's attempted murder.{{Ref|GOT104}}

[[File:In the hills.jpg|thumb|Tyrion defends his innocence to Catelyn en route to the Eyrie.]]
Catelyn takes Tyrion, who protests his innocence, to the [[Eyrie]]. A [[Mercenary|sellsword]] from the inn, [[Bronn]], accompanies them, noting Tyrion's wealth and a promise he will handsomely reward any man who helps him. They are attacked by the [[hill tribes]] and Tyrion barely manages to defend himself.{{Ref|GOT105}}

Tyrion warns Catelyn that her sister, [[Lysa Arryn|Lysa]], has become irrational with grief and will try to kill him. She is skeptical, but Tyrion is proven correct: Lysa accuses him conspiring in her [[Jon Arryn]]'s death. Tyrion is thrown into one of the Eyrie's "sky-cells", dungeons which open onto a ravine on one side.{{Ref|GOT105}}

[[File:Tyrion_and_Mord.jpg|thumb|Tyrion in the sky cells of the Eyrie.]]
Tyrion bargains with his gaoler, [[Mord]], to get an audience with Lady Arryn and he "confesses" to being a whoremonger and dwarf, before demanding a [[First trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]]. Bronn agrees to stand as his champion and kills [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Vardis Egen]], freeing Tyrion. Bronn accompanies him on the journey south.{{Ref|GOT106}}

[[File:Shagga.jpg|thumb|Tyrion bargains with the hill tribes.]]
Tyrion establishes some ground rules with Bronn, saying he will pay more money than anyone else who attempts to bribe him to betray Tyrion. They are then surrounded by men of the [[hill tribes]], led by [[Shagga]]. Tyrion uses his quick wit and words to win the allegiance of the tribes, offering to better equip them for battle and help them conquer the Vale of Arryn in return for their help. Shagga agrees, though he notes that if Tyrion tries to renege on his promise he will cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.{{Ref|GOT108}}

Tywin Lannister's forces have been attacking Catelyn's home in the Riverlands ever since she arrested Tyrion. It's not that he cares so much about Tyrion, he explains to Jaime, but because even though Tyrion is the least of them he is still a Lannister, and if they allow one of their own to be taken so easily, they risk losing the respect of the other Houses. The hill tribesmen deliver Tyrion to his father's army, where he learns that [[Robb Stark]] is leading an army to war. Tyrion warns his father that Robb should not be underestimated. Tywin agrees to honor Tyrion's alliance with the hill tribes. When Shagga says they will only fight if Tyrion is with them on the field, Tywin also agrees, to Tyrion's dismay.{{Ref|GOT108}}

[[File:Tyrion_and_Bronn_1x09.png|thumb|Tyrion drinks with Bronn before battle.]]
Tyrion is commanded by his father to lead the hill tribes into battle from the front. Feeling that his father means to kill him, Tyrion retires to his tent, where he finds that Bronn has found a prostitute for him, a girl named [[Shae]]. Tyrion attempts to learn more about Shae via a drinking game, but finds his questions deflected. Instead he tells her about his own past with Tysha, a wheelwright's daughter. They married and spent several happy weeks together until Tywin learned of the matter. Tywin had Jaime tell Tyrion the truth, that Tysha was a prostitute that Jaime had paid to make his brother happy for a while. Tywin then gave her a piece of silver for every one of his guards she had sex with while Tyrion was forced to watch. Since then Tyrion has never attempted to take a wife or lover, only whores he can pay and send on their way.{{Ref|GOT109}}

[[File:Tyrion 1x09.jpg|thumb|Tyrion leads the hill tribes to battle. ]]
The next morning, Tyrion leads the tribes into [[Battle on the Green Fork|battle]] at the [[Green Fork]], but is knocked out by one of his own warriors' mis-swung hammers just as the engagement begins. He is found by Bronn, after the battle, who brings Tyrion before his father on a medical stretcher. He learns from his father that Robb deceived them, delaying their army with a feinting force so the main Stark host can fall on and defeat Jaime's army in battle, with the Northern army now regrouping for an attack on King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT109}}

[[File:Tyrion_and_Tywin_1x10.png|thumb|Tyrion discusses the future with his father.]]
With Jaime captured, Robb's forces now allied to those of the Riverlands and both [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] and [[Renly Baratheon]] claiming the [[Iron Throne]], the odds have swung against the Lannisters. Tywin risks being caught between three armies, so he retreats to [[Harrenhal]]. Tyrion makes shrewd observations about the ominous turn the current situation has taken now that Joffrey has killed Eddard. Grudgingly impressed, Tywin orders Tyrion to report to King's Landing and act as the Hand of the King to try to keep Joffrey in line and execute any of the [[Small Council]] members if they try anything treasonous. Tywin forbids him to take "that whore" with him, but Tyrion defies him and asks Shae to come to King's Landing with him.{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]] ===
[[File:Tyrion S2Promo.jpg|thumb|Tyrion returns to King's Landing.]]
Tyrion arrives in King's Landing, accompanied by [[Bronn]], Lannister [[Man-at-arms|soldiers]], and members of the [[hill tribes]]. He assumes the role of acting [[Hand of the King]] to [[Joffrey Baratheon]], who isn't happy to see him, unlike Myrcella and Tommen. After taking his seat at the Small Council, he clashes with his sister, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister, over her failure to stop the execution of his predecessor as hand, Eddard Stark. He also criticizes her for allowing [[Arya Stark]] to escape, as the girl and her father could have been useful to bargain for the return of Jaime. {{Ref|GOT201}}

[[File:ShaeAndTyrion.jpg|thumb|Tyrion hides Shae in the Tower of the Hand.]]
He installs Shae in the [[Tower of the Hand]], in defiance of [[Tywin Lannister|his father]]'s orders. She is initially thrilled at being brought to the capital, and says that big cities make her "want to fuck." He explains how populous the liars of King's Landing are, trying to convince Shae that he is somewhat truthful in comparison. He also laments Eddard Stark and his honor, but also remarks on how that was his downfall, emphasizing how the court is built on his lies. Tyrion states that he will make changes during his tenure as Hand of the King to Shae, before the two share a tender kiss.{{Ref|GOT201}}

Tyrion warns [[Varys]] not to underestimate him after the Spider discovers Shae's presence and lets Tyrion know that he is aware of her. During a Small Council session, Tyrion finds himself the only sympathetic ear to a request by the [[Night's Watch]] for aid from the throne. He also criticizes Cersei's lack of talent for diplomacy when she rejects peace terms from [[Robb Stark]] brought by their cousin Ser [[Alton Lannister]]. Tyrion invites Lord [[Janos Slynt]] for dinner and gets him to confess his part in the recent [[Massacre in King's Landing|massacre]] of [[Robert Baratheon|King Robert]]'s bastards as well as his part in the betrayal of Eddard. After openly noting Slynt's lack of honor, Tyrion has Lord Janos exiled to the Wall as punishment, and installs Bronn as commander of the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] in his place.{{Ref|GOT202}}

Tyrion arranges for Shae to serve as a handmaiden to [[Sansa Stark]] when she demands more freedom. He tests the loyalty of the remaining Small Council members by feeding them varying plans for marriage alliances involving [[Myrcella Baratheon|Princess Myrcella Baratheon]]. He is confronted by Cersei about sending Myrcella to Dorne in a betrothal to the youngest son of [[House Martell]]. Tyrion has [[Pycelle]] thrown into the black cells for revealing the information given only to him. Varys congratulates him for the ploy to lure out the Queen's informant. Tyrion is also confronted by an angry [[Petyr Baelish]] for having been unwittingly involved in the ruse; nevertheless, Tyrion recruits Littlefinger in a plan to convince [[Catelyn Stark]] to release Jaime, offering him [[Harrenhal]] and the title of [[Lord Paramount of the Trident]].{{Ref|GOT203}}

Tyrion is shocked and furious to find Joffrey orchestrating the public beating of Sansa for her [[Robb Stark|brother's]] victory in the [[Battle of Oxcross]]. He orders a halt to the proceedings, and warns Joffrey to consider his actions more carefully, lest he wants to suffer the same fate as the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. He then escorts Sansa out of the throne room. Bronn suggests that Joffrey would benefit from sexual release. Tyrion arranges for two whores for his nephew but Joffrey forces one to beat the other as a message to Tyrion. [[Lancel Lannister]] visits Tyrion to demand the release of Pycelle on Cersei's behalf. Tyrion notes the lateness of the hour and traps Lancel into admitting his sexual relationship with Cersei. Tyrion uses the information to blackmail Lancel into acting as his informant.{{Ref|GOT204}}

[[File:Tyrion see Wildfire.png|thumb|Tyrion discovers Cersei's storage of wildfire.]]
Tyrion reports news of King [[Renly Baratheon]]'s death to Cersei. She is pleased, but Tyrion predicts [[Stannis Baratheon]]'s imminent attack having assumed control of Renly's men. He tries to discuss plans for their defense, but she insists on keeping them secret. He learns that she is reliant of the [[Alchemists' Guild]] from Lancel. He visits Wisdom [[Hallyne]] and learns that the guild have stockpiled thousands of jars of [[Wildfire]] to use as catapult ammunition. [[Bronn]] sees this strategy as potentially disastrous because of the volatile nature of wildfire. Tyrion orders Hallyne to answer to him instead of Cersei. He passes a street protest that blames him for the ills of the city, as the people believe him to be manipulating Joffrey.{{Ref|GOT205}}

Tyrion and the court assemble at the shore of [[Blackwater Bay]] for the departure of Princess Myrcella. Cersei remains angry about Tyrion's arrangements for her daughter, threatening to one day deprive him of someone he loves. As they return to the [[Red Keep]] through the city, they are confronted by angry crowds of starving Smallfolk. Sensing the imminent danger, Tyrion orders a guard to escort Prince Tommen back to the Keep by another route. Shortly after, Joffrey is hit by thrown excrement and triggers a [[Riots in King's Landing|riot]] by demanding that his guards kill everyone in the crowd. Tyrion is horrified when the [[High Septon (Joffrey)|High Septon]] is torn to pieces by the famished crowd. He marshals his guards to lead him to safety. Once the royal family is safely separated from the mob, Tyrion confronts Joffrey for triggering the riot and the war that preceded it, calling him a vicious idiot. He slaps Joffrey when his nephew refuses to listen to the criticism. Tyrion orders Meryn Trant to retrieve the missing Sansa, knowing that Jaime's life is also on the line, but Meryn will not follow his orders. He is relieved when [[Sandor Clegane]] brings her to safety.{{Ref|GOT206}}

Cersei confesses that she believes Joffrey's viciousness might be the price she pays for her sin of incest with Jaime. Tyrion does not know how to comfort his sister in this rare moment of vulnerability, but reminds her that both Myrcella and Tommen are kind and gentle. Word that Stannis' fleet is days away reinforces the need to control Joffrey.{{Ref|GOT207}}

[[File:GOT208.jpg|thumb|Tyrion studies texts in preparation for Stannis's attack.]]
Tyrion turns to books for insight into siege defense tactics, notably [[Ch'Vyalthan]]'s ''[[An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros]]'', but Bronn warns that the grim realities of a siege cannot be understood from reading, stating that the idea of a siege is to cause starvation and disorder to those who are fortified, and that many undeserving criminals revel in this. Tyrion affirms the loyalty of Varys and is enigmatic about his plans for the battle, but believes Stannis will attack at the [[River Gate|Mud Gate]].{{Ref|GOT208}}

[[File:Tyrion and Varys.jpg|thumb|Varys warns Tyrion of Daenerys Targaryen. ]]
On the ramparts, Joffrey wishes to attack Robb Stark's forces now that Winterfell has [[Capture of Winterfell|fallen]] to the [[Ironborn]], but Tyrion advises against it, due to Stannis' impending attack on King's Landing. After Joffrey leaves, Varys commends Tyrion on his ability to play the game of thrones, then warns him that [[Daenerys Targaryen]] has survived and has three [[dragon]]s. Once again, Tyrion prefers to focus on the problem at hand.{{Ref|GOT208}}

[[File:Lamprey Pie 2.jpg|thumb|Tyrion informs Cersei of Stannis's movements.]]
After learning that Joffrey is keen to fight in defense of the city, Cersei is furious and suspects Tyrion of trying to kill her son. She mistakenly identifies [[Ros]] as his lover because of the Lannister pendant Tyrion gave her and seizes the opportunity to deliver on the threat she made when Myrcella left. Cersei has the prostitute kidnapped as insurance against Tyrion placing Joffrey in harm's way. Tyrion later visits Cersei in her chambers, where he tells of Stannis being spotted near [[Tarth]], with his navy surpassing that of the [[royal fleet]]. She reveals her capture of Ros to Tyrion, who fears that she means Shae, referring to her only a "your little whore."{{Ref|GOT208}}

[[File:Tyrion and Shae.jpg|thumb|Tyrion confesses his love for Shae.]]
Tyrion is relieved that Shae is unhurt, but vows to free Ros and when the prostitute is taken away, he promises Cersei that he will exact revenge on her, before she banishes him for her presence. He rushes back to his lover's side and confesses the depth of his feeling for her, both of them mentioning that they would violently defend each other, while warning that they must be doubly careful.{{Ref|GOT208}}

[[File:Tyrion and Podrick 2x09.png|thumb|Podrick armors Tyrion for battle.]]
He spends the night before the expected siege in bed with Shae, telling her she can still leave the city. Tyrion has Varys provide him with a map of the tunnel network beneath the city. Varys tells Tyrion that he is all that stands between them and defeat. He later meets Shae, now Sansa's maid, and pretends not to know her in order to keep their relationship from Cersei. Tyrion then smiles at Sansa's false loyalty to Joffrey, noting how she has already began to understand the falsehood of court life.{{Ref|GOT209}}

[[File:Tyrion Joffrey Lancel.png|thumb|Tyrion defends King's Landing with wildfire.]]
Tyrion leads the defense of the city during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], commanding the defenders at the Mud Gate. He destroys a large portion of the attacking fleet by luring them into a trap; a ship filled with Wildfire and allowed to leak its cargo into the bay. He signals Bronn to detonate the Wildfire using a flaming arrow. Stannis continues with the assault, landing his troops further out in the bay to avoid the devastation of the explosion.{{Ref|GOT209}}

[[File:Tyrion_speech_2x09.jpg|thumb|Tyrion rallies the Lannister troops.]]
Tyrion's initial attempts to repel the attackers are unsuccessful and Cersei has Joffrey withdrawn to the Red Keep, with the King leaving Ser [[Mandon Moore]] and Ser [[Boros Blount]] of the Kingsguard to fight in his name. Tyrion is faced with increasing dissent from his troops but rallies them with a rousing speech. He personally leads a sortie through the tunnels under the city, destroying Stannis' siege equipment.{{Ref|GOT209}}

[[File:Tyrion Blackwater Promo.jpg|thumb|Tyrion is wounded by Ser Mandon.]]
He is trapped outside the walls by a group of reinforcements and then betrayed by Ser Mandon. Mandon slashes Tyrion across the face but Podrick kills him with a spear before he can finish Tyrion off. As Tyrion collapses into unconsciousness a host of Lannister-Tyrell reinforcements led by [[Loras Tyrell|a man]] wearing Renly's armor arrives to claim the victory.{{Ref|GOT209}} His father is also present among the victors, who is proclaimed [[Savior of the City]], whilst Tyrion's effects have been passed over.{{Ref|GOT210}}

Tyrion awakens to find [[Pycelle]] looming over him. The reinstated Grand Maester gloatingly informs Tyrion that he has been relieved as Acting Hand of the King and moved to new chambers. Tyrion rejects pain relief, fearing that his enemy will poison him. He calls for Podrick to summon his allies, Varys and Bronn. Varys visits Tyrion and regretfully tells him that although his leadership was key to saving the city he will not be recognized by King Joffrey. He also reports that Bronn has been relieved of his command and his tribesmen have taken their plunder and gone home.{{Ref|GOT210}}

[[File:Shae_and_Tyrion_Scar_2x10.png|thumb|Tyrion shows Shae his scarred face.]]
Varys offers a small consolation; he has brought Shae to see Tyrion. Varys leaves them alone and Shae removes Tyrion's bandages to reveal a scar marring his whole face. Tyrion is self-pitying; she angrily asserts her love for him and begs him to flee to [[Pentos]] with her. He says that standing up to the bad people in his life, out-talking and out-thinking them, is something that he is good at and enjoys. He chooses to stay in King's Landing and she agrees to remain with him.{{Ref|GOT210}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]] ===
Some weeks after the Battle of Blackwater, Cersei pays Tyrion a visit accompanied by two of her son's Kingsguard. She only gains entrance to Tyrion's chambers after agreeing to leave her guards outside. Once inside Cersei demands to know how he will "slander" her to their father now that he is here. Tyrion asks when he has ever slandered her before, and she reminds him of a time at Casterly Rock that he got her in serious trouble with their father: when she was nine years old, Cersei discovered that a servant girl (also nine years old) had stolen a necklace, so she had her guards beat the girl, who ended up losing an eye. Tyrion told their father what Cersei had done and he was angered, but Cersei notes that the servant girl never stole a necklace again. Tyrion quips that it isn't "slander" if it's true, and he only told Tywin what she really did. The queen admits that Tyrion is a clever man but not as clever as he might believe. Tyrion merely retorts that this still makes him a great deal more clever that her. Cersei then leaves abruptly and just in time to prevent Meryn Trant and Bronn from exchanging blows.{{Ref|GOT301}}

[[File:Valar Dohaeris still tyrion.png|thumb|Tyrion discusses Bronn's payment.]]
Tyrion is surprised to understand that Bronn (who had defended him against Cersei's entourage) has been knighted and styles himself as "Ser Bronn of the Blackwater." While possessing no lands, wealth, or titles, this drastically elevates his social standing - and in his mind, his pay. He tells Tyrion that he still thinks of him a friend, but he is still a sellsword, and as a knight Tyrion should pay him double what he used to, reminding him of his promise made after [[First trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|his trial]].{{Ref|GOT301}}

[[File:Tyrion_and_Tywin_Mhysa.png|thumb|Tyrion meets with his father.]]
After speaking with his sister, Tyrion requests his father give him [[Casterly Rock]], as Jaime gave up all rights of inheritance when he joined the Kingsguard. This leaves Tyrion as the next in lawful line of succession as [[Lord of Casterly Rock]]. Tywin hatefully spites his son for "killing" his mother in childbirth, and saying that although he will reward him in due time, he will never make Tyrion heir to Casterly Rock, considering him an abomination and a curse who would only humiliate the family name and turn Casterly Rock into a brothel. As Tyrion leaves, Tywin warns him that if he catches another whore in his bed he will hang her.{{Ref|GOT301}}

Shae sneaks into Tyrion's new chambers. He warns her that his father threatened to kill her if he found her with him again, and that his father follows through on such threats. Undeterred, Shae starts undressing Tyrion, and asks him for a favor; to protect Sansa from Baelish. Tyrion says that he no longer has enough power or influence to attempt to do that, though Shae accuses him of being attracted to Sansa, which he cheerfully denies. It also comes out that Tyrion had sex with Ros back in the North, though Tyrion points out it was before he met Shae. They playfully bicker about it as they start having sex.{{Ref|GOT302}}

[[File:Game-of-thrones-3.03-walk-of-punishment-chairs.png|thumb|Tyrion defies his father during a Small Council meeting. ]]
Tywin Lannister calls the first meeting of the [[Small Council]] since he arrived in the city, arriving early and has all of the council members called in at once. All of the seats are on one side of the table, as a non-verbal test to see how each of them reacts around him. Tyrion is the only one who even mildly stands up to Tywin's posturing, by not even trying to sit closest to Tywin: instead he takes a new chair and makes a point of noisily dragging it across the ground until it is positioned at the exact opposite end of the table from his father. It is announced that [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] will marry Lady [[Lysa Arryn]]. Tyrion points out that if Baelish departs for the Vale that leaves a vacancy on the Small Council, and Tywin reveals that he has appointed Tyrion as the new [[Master of Coin]] to replace him. While this may seem like giving Tyrion a position of relative power again, Tyrion quickly points out that he has no prior experience in finance. With backhanded compliments, Cersei makes it clear that this promotion is really intended to give him an opportunity to make mistakes he will be blamed for.{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:Tyrion littlefinger 3x03.jpg|thumb|Petyr transfers the Master of Coin's documents to Tyrion.]]
After the meeting, Tyrion, Podrick and Bronn drop by Littlefinger's office in his brothel, where he keeps his ledgers. Littlefinger says it was the safest place to keep such records, but Tyrion notes that his brothel hasn't been the safest place for bastards. Baelish says he hopes Tyrion does well in the position, as he owes him for securing the release of [[Ros]] (after Cersei arrested her, mistaking her for Shae) but Tyrion says it was just a misunderstanding. Tyrion and Bronn then lead Pod into another room of the brothel, where Tyrion says that he wants to reward him for saving his life during the Battle of the Blackwater: he has paid for Podrick (who has never had sex with a woman) to enjoy the services of not one, but three prostitutes.{{Ref|GOT303}}

Later, Tyrion is reading through the financial records, and explains to Bronn that not all is as Baelish would like the court to think. Bronn asks if he thinks Littlefinger has been stealing to obtain the crown's money, but Tyrion says the problem is more that he's been borrowing all of it. Littlefinger always acted like he was a financial genius who could raise money seemingly out of nowhere, but in reality the Iron Throne is heavily in debt, and Littlefinger procured enough money to balance the books every year by borrowing massive sums of money from foreign banks. In particular, much of their debt is owed to the Iron Bank of Braavos, the largest bank in the Free Cities. Tyrion warns Bronn that when debtors to the Iron Bank cannot repay their loans, the Iron Bank will first refuse to give out new loans, and ultimately support rebellions against them.{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:We_need_Details.jpg|thumb|Tyrion and Ser Bronn learn from Podrick.]]
Tyrion fears that if they can't repay the debt, the Iron Bank will eventually cut them off and start supporting Robb Stark or Stannis Baratheon. Podrick then returns, with the money Tyrion gave him to pay the prostitutes. Tyrion is concerned that he lost heart and fled, but Pod innocently says he did "all sorts of things" with the prostitutes - they simply refused his offer of payment. Impressed that the women would provide their services for free, Tyrion and Bronn ask Pod to explain in detail what transpired, so they can take "copious notes."{{Ref|GOT303}}

[[File:Season 3 Ep4 Varys Tyrion.png|thumb|Varys tells Tyrion of his past.]]
Escorted by Varys to a dark room, Tyrion is finally told the story of how the eunuch was traveling through the [[Free Cities]] with a party of actors. It is revealed that he was castrated by a male sorcerer who spoke to the air and 'something' answered him. Varys then pries open the box in the room and reveals the [[Sorcerer]] who had done this terrible deed.{{Ref|GOT304}}

Lady [[Olenna Tyrell]] explains to Tyrion that [[House Tyrell]] will support the cost of the wedding between Joffrey and Margaery. Following this, Lord Tywin summons both Tyrion and Cersei to his chambers to inform them of his plans to wed them off, Cersei to Loras Tyrell and Tyrion to Sansa Stark, who Tywin explains will be heir to Winterfell after he defeats Robb Stark, thus giving the Lannisters a future foothold in the North.{{Ref|GOT305}}

[[File:Cersei-and-Tyrion.jpg|thumb|Tyrion & Cersei ponder their forced marriages.]]
Cersei and Tyrion are evidently reluctant to consider these marriages, Tyrion in particular emphasizing how it will be worse for Loras and Sansa than for himself and his sister, especially since Sansa hoped to marry Loras herself. Partway through the discussion, Tyrion brings up the question of who employed Ser [[Mandon Moore]] to kill Tyrion. Cersei, of course, denies her involvement, but Tyrion is still suspicious, as well as suggesting that Joffrey may be the culprit,as Tyrion is the only one who dares to speak against the King.{{Ref|GOT306}}

Tyrion speaks with Sansa before their wedding at the Great Sept of Baelor; though he knows the girl is not thrilled at the prospect of marrying him. Tyrion promises Sansa that he will not mistreat her, and Sansa agrees there are worse Lannisters she could be wed to.{{Ref|GOT308}}

[[File:Second sons marriage sansa tyrion.jpg|thumb|Sansa and Tyrion marry in a humiliating ceremony.]]
The ceremony is a grim affair; Joffrey smugly escorts Sansa to the altar in place of her father and petulantly removes the stool upon which Tyrion was to stand on to cloak Sansa in Lannister colors as part of the ceremony, eliciting snickers from the congregation (though the scowl of Lord Tywin quickly silences them). Tyrion in the face of humiliation asks Sansa to kneel and he places the cloak around her shoulders. The new High Septon begins the ceremony. Later as man and wife they have their reception dinner, which also proves a grim and miserable affair.{{Ref|GOT308}}

[[File:Tyrion threatens.jpg|thumb|A drunken Tyrion threatens Joffrey.]]
At the night of their wedding, Tyrion gets drunk and threatens Joffrey with castration after the latter commands him to carry out the bedding ceremony with Sansa. Tywin calms Joffrey and Tyrion takes Sansa to his bedchamber, where he tells her that his lord father has commanded him to consummate the marriage. As Sansa begins to disrobe, Tyrion refuses, insisting that he won't bed her until she wants him to, then he passes out drunk.{{Ref|GOT308}}

[[File:Shae Sansa and Tyrion Mhysa.png|thumb|Tyrion starts to bond with Sansa, despite their circumstances.]]
After his marriage, Tyrion starts bonding with Sansa and lightly enhances his relationship with her, making crude jokes in an attempt to cheer each other. The two discuss how they would punish social enemies, rather than the harsh reality of political ones. Both Shae and Tyrion silently remark on Sansa's innocence when it comes to vulgar language, until he is called away when Tywin calls a meeting of the Small Council where Joffrey happily informs him that Robb and Catelyn Stark have both been murdered at the [[Red Wedding]] by [[Walder Frey]]. He orders Grand Maester Pycelle to thank Frey and command him to send Robb Stark's head, which he will serve to Sansa at his wedding, fulfilling an earlier promise to her. However, Tyrion threatens him yet again before Pycelle can send any messages to the [[Twins]]. After the end of the meeting, Tywin and Tyrion discuss the details of what consequences the Red Wedding might have on the war. Tyrion knows that Walder Frey will receive all the credit for the massacre, but also the blame, and correctly deduces that Tywin is the true mastermind behind the Wedding, much to his displeasure. Tywin tells him that [[Roose Bolton]] is Warden of the North until he impregnates Sansa Stark, but Tyrion assures him that he can't and won't do it even forcefully. Tywin lectures Tyrion on protecting family legacy and that the house that puts family first will always prevail over the family the fulfills the wishes of its sons and daughters first.{{Ref|GOT310}} 

Tyrion accuses Tywin and protests that he has never done something for the benefit of the family that wasn't in his interest. Tywin tells him that when he was born, he wanted to leave him in the sea and let the waves take him away, and that he instead he let him live and raised him because he is a Lannister. Afterwards, he returns to Sansa, who is in tears having heard of her brother and mother's tragedy. Later, Cersei visits Tyrion and informs him that she won't be marrying Ser Loras. She also advises him to give Sansa children, to which Tyrion responds by asking her how happy is she with her children. Cersei admits that if it wasn't for her children, she would've killed herself, even for Joffrey. She ponders how happy he used to be in his infant years and how much he brought such joy in her life at that time, and that neither Joffrey nor anyone else can take that away from her.{{Ref|GOT310}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
[[File:BronnTyrionPodrickS4EP01.png|thumb|Tyrion awaits the arrival of Prince [[Doran Martell]].]]
Tyrion is sent to welcome Prince [[Doran Martell]] to King's Landing. As he, Podrick, and Bronn are expecting the Dornishman, they spot [[House Martell|Martell]] bannermen coming their way. Tyrion greets them, but they inform him that Prince Doran's declining health prevents him from leaving [[Sunspear]], and therefore he has sent his brother Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] to attend King Joffrey's wedding in his stead. They also explain that Oberyn went ahead and entered the city before dawn. Tyrion quickly puts together that he may be at one of Littlefinger's brothels. When Tyrion arrives, he finds Prince Oberyn stabbing a man's hand for singing "[[The Rains of Castamere]]." He is introduced to Oberyn's [[paramour]], [[Ellaria Sand]], and asks the Dornishman to talk in private.{{Ref|GOT401}}

[[File:Oberyn-tirion.jpg|thumb|Oberyn warns Tyrion.]]
He asks him why he came to the capital and Oberyn tells him that he was invited to the royal wedding. Tyrion knows he's lying and asks for the honest truth. Oberyn remembers how [[Rhaegar Targaryen]] wed his sister [[Elia Martell|Elia]], and how his involvement with [[Lyanna Stark|another woman]] started [[Robert's Rebellion]]. He tells Tyrion that the war ended with his father [[Sack of King's Landing|sacking the city]] while "The Mountain" (Ser [[Gregor Clegane]]) brutally murdered Elia's children, then raped and murdered her. He orders Tyrion to tell his father that he's here, and warns him that the Lannisters are not the only ones who pay their debts.{{Ref|GOT401}}
 
[[File:Sansatyrion.png|thumb|Tyrion attempts to comfort a bereaved Sansa.]]
Afterwards, he visits a deeply depressed Sansa and tries to comfort her by telling her that her brother and mother were good people. In tears, she tells him the grueling details of how they died. Tyrion advises her to stay strong, as that is what her mother would want. Sansa leaves to go to the [[godswood]] and she tells Tyrion that she doesn't pray anymore, and instead goes because nobody is talking to her there. Distraught, he returns to his bedchamber, where Shae is waiting for him. She tries to pleasure him but Tyrion refuses. Shae questions him if he's really in love with Sansa. Tyrion says that he doesn't and this time, Shae asks him if he wants her out of the city. After getting no answer, she storms out of his bedchamber, and it is revealed that one of Cersei's spies heard the whole conversation.{{Ref|GOT401}}

[[File:Joffrey presented with Lives of Four Kings.png|thumb|Tyrion presents Joffrey with a tedious tome. ]]
In the days following, Tyrion, along with other noblemen and women present in King's Landing, attend the breakfast on the morning of Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell's [[Purple Wedding|wedding]]. He meets [[Varys]] before arriving, who informs him of Cersei's spy and Cersei's consequent knowledge of Shae's presence, and warns him that Tywin will know shortly. Varys also warns him that he will not protect Tyrion or Shae against the former's father and sister out of regard for his own safety. At the breakfast, Tyrion observes Cersei's indication of Shae to her father as "the whore I told you about." Tywin subsequently requests that she be brought to the [[Tower of the Hand]] before the wedding. Tyrion then presents the groom a gift of a tome detailing the reigns of [[Daeron I Targaryen|Daeron, the Young Dragon]]; [[Baelor I Targaryen|Baelor the Blessed]]; [[Aegon IV Targaryen|Aegon the Unworthy]] and [[Daeron II Targaryen|Daeron the Good]]. This is met with surprising approval and gratitude from the King until he is presented with a [[Valyrian steel]] [[Widow's Wail|sword]] by his grandfather and proceeds to demonstrate the blade's sharpness by destroying the book with it.{{Ref|GOT402}}

[[File:Shae leaving.png|thumb|Tyrion banishes Shae from to Pentos.]]
After the breakfast, Tyrion meets with Shae in his quarters and shows uncharacteristic and confusing coldness towards her despite her gestures of affection. He terminates their "friendship" and informs her that she is to leave and go to live in [[Pentos]], telling her that she must do so in order for him to uphold her marital vows to Sansa. She deduces that he is afraid of his sister and father and expresses her desire to fight them alongside him. As she draws closer, Tyrion yells at her, calling her a whore, and states her unfitness to bear his children, in contrast to Sansa's. Bronn arrives to escort the sobbing Shae to the docks, resulting in her slapping him and storming off.{{Ref|GOT402}}

[[File:joffrey+tyrion wine-spill.jpg|thumb|Joffrey insults Tyrion at the former's wedding feast.]]
At the wedding feast, Joffrey organizes some entertainment: five dwarfs mockingly re-enacting the [[War of the Five Kings]]. Tyrion, disgusted, instructs Podrick to pay each dwarf 20 gold dragons after the show. At the conclusion of the show, Joffrey suggests Tyrion fight the former's dwarf counterpart. Tyrion politely declines and sarcastically voices awe at Joffrey's skill and bravery at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]] and his desire to see them again. Insulted at the disrespectful undertone, Joffrey pours his wine over Tyrion's head in an immature show of superiority. He then instructs Tyrion to act as his [[cupbearer]], before kicking the goblet under a table, forcing Tyrion to handle it several times. He finally orders him to kneel and Tyrion, obviously possessing no intention to do so, is saved by the arrival of the pigeon pie. He attempts to leave with Sansa, but is spotted by Joffrey, who commands him to remain and continue his duties as his cupbearer. Tyrion hands the king his goblet, who begins to choke after drinking from it. In his final moments, Joffrey points to Tyrion, apparently accusing him, as the latter inspects the goblet for poison, and he is seized and arrested by members of the [[Kingsguard]] on Cersei's orders.{{Ref|GOT402}}

[[File:Podrick visits tyrion in his cell.png|thumb|Podrick visits Tyrion.]]
After Tyrion has been incarcerated, he gets a visit from Podrick who smuggles in some food and writing materials to help him get through prison life. He informs Tyrion of Sansa's disappearance. Tyrion is sure that Sansa had nothing to do with the murder.  
Just as Pod leaves he turns around and tells Tyrion about a man whom he didn't know offering him a knighthood if he testified against him. Tyrion knew that it wasn't a suggestion, and soon enough, they'll threaten him with something worse. Tyrion advises Pod to leave King's Landing, sending him off with a final farewell.{{Ref|GOT403}}

At Bronn's intervention, Jaime comes to see Tyrion. Jaime tries to comfort Tyrion and says that he suffered much worse with the North. Jaime asks Tyrion if he did it and Tyrion says he would never kill his brother's son, no matter how despicable he turned out to be. Tyrion asks Jaime to set him free, but Jaime says he can't because of treason and says the trial will get to the truth. Tyrion knows that the trial doesn't matter: Cersei won't rest until Tyrion is dead. Jaime then goes on to him believing that Sansa had something to do with the murder, but Tyrion is again adamant that Sansa is innocent.{{Ref|GOT404}}

[[File:Game-of-thrones-laws-gods-men-trial.jpg|thumb|Tyrion is cross-examined by Prince Oberyn Martell, Lord Tywin Lannister, and Lord Mace Tyrell.]]
Tyrion's trial begins with the newly-crowned [[King]] [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] recusing himself. Instead, a group of three judges are appointed to oversee the trial: Tywin Lannister as presiding judge, Lord [[Mace Tyrell]] of the [[Reach]], and Prince Oberyn. Cersei has several witnesses testify against Tyrion, such as [[Meryn Trant]], [[Grand Maester]] [[Pycelle]], and [[Varys]]. They all give strong (yet circumstantial) evidence of Tyrion's guilt. He seems particularly hurt by Varys's betrayal, so much that he asks the spymaster whether he remembered what he had told him after the Battle of the Blackwater (that Tyrion had saved the city and that Varys knew it even if history wouldn't). Varys sadly tells Tyrion that he never forgets anything.{{Ref|GOT406}}

[[File:Jaime in The Laws of Gods and Men.jpg|thumb|Jaime tells Tyrion of Tywin's compromise.]]
After an hour's recess, Jaime comes to Tyrion and tells him that, when the verdict of guilty is pronounced, he must ask for mercy. Secretly, Jaime had made a deal with Tywin: in exchange for sparing Tyrion, Jaime will renounce his vows and return to Casterly Rock as Tywin's heir, while Tyrion will be sent to live out his days on the [[Wall]] with the [[Night's Watch]]. Tyrion points out that their father wanted this outcome all along. However, Cersei calls in her last witness: [[Shae]]. A hurt Tyrion can do little as Shae reveals his sexual pleasures in front of the court and his supposed desire to bed Sansa Stark, which she agreed to let him do if he killed the King for her. Tyrion's anger at the betrayal leads him to finally lash out. With tears in his eyes, he angrily states that ''he'' had saved [[King's Landing]] from Stannis, not Tywin or the Tyrells, and now wishes he had just let Stannis kill them all, especially after how easily they turned against him for allegedly murdering a King who, in all irony, they hated and despised.{{Ref|GOT406}}

[[File:Tyrion 4x07.jpg|thumb|Tyrion demands a trial by combat.]]
Tywin attempts to silence Tyrion but his son turns on Cersei, declaring that he was innocent of killing Joffrey but wished he had, adding with gleeful venom that he derived more relief from watching her "vicious bastard" of a son die than he could have gotten from a thousand lying whores. He then turns on Tywin and calls the trial a farce and that it is really a repetition of the trial he had been on since he was born: for the crime of being a dwarf. Not wanting to submit to the "justice" that was being served on him, Tyrion demands a [[trial by combat]]. The court exploded in shock and multitudes of gasps, and amid it all Tywin and Tyrion Lannister lock eyes, with a tense glare of rage on Tywin's face, and a subtle grin of triumph on Tyrion's.{{Ref|GOT406}}

[[File:Tyrion and Jaime Lannister 4x07.jpg|thumb|Jaime declines Tyrion's plea.]]
In his cell, Tyrion and [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] discuss Tyrion's fate and the irony of Lord [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] striking down both his heirs if Jaime were to die being Tyrion's champion, Jaime angry with Tyrion for not seizing Tywin's offer of the Night's Watch, to which Tyrion replies that Shae's lies ended that possibility. Jaime declines to be Tyrion's champion as he cannot fight well enough with his left hand.{{Ref|GOT407}}

[[File:Tyrion-bronn.jpg|thumb|Bronn refuses to be Tyrion's champion in trial by combat.]]
Tyrion asks Jaime to bring him [[Bronn]]. Bronn arrives in the clothes of a lord, with news that he is to marry [[Lollys Stokeworth]], a noble's daughter, in a match arranged by Cersei. He will not fight [[Gregor Clegane|the Mountain]] (whom Cersei has chosen for her champion), believing Clegane to be too dangerous for him to face, and bids farewell to Tyrion. They share a final handshake and part on good terms.{{Ref|GOT407}}

Later, Tyrion is approached by [[Oberyn Martell]], who tells Tyrion of their first encounter: As children, Oberyn and his sister [[Elia Martell|Elia]] were told stories of the "monster" that had been born to Tywin Lannister. During a childhood visit to [[Casterly Rock]], Cersei showed Tyrion, with great ceremony, to Oberyn and Elia. Oberyn tells Tyrion that, to his disappointment, he saw no monster, just a baby. Cersei told Oberyn and his sister that Tyrion killed her mother, and then cruelly assaulted Tyrion until Jaime stopped her. Oberyn tells Tyrion that he seeks justice for the death of his sister, and Tyrion replies that he will "find none here." Oberyn counters that he is in the perfect place; all those he means to bring to justice for his sister's murder are close at hand. Intending to start his revenge with Gregor Clegane, Oberyn offers his service as Tyrion's champion in the coming trial by combat.{{Ref|GOT407}}

[[File:Mountain and viper ep3 jaime.jpg|thumb|Jaime visits Tyrion before his trial by combat.]]
On the day of the trial by combat, Jaime visits Tyrion in his cell. They discuss their dead cousin [[Orson Lannister]] and his habit of smashing beetles with rocks for no reason. Tyrion says he used to watch Orson for long periods of time and think about the reason behind his actions, but he hasn't come to any conclusion why all those countless beetles had to be killed. When Jaime says he doesn't know either, bells start tolling and he wishes Tyrion good luck.{{Ref|GOT408}}

Bound in shackles, Tyrion is taken to watch the duel of Oberyn and the Mountain. Before the fight starts, he advises Oberyn against drinking wine, but he doesn't pay a lot of attention to him. As the Red Viper starts winning, he exchanges a few hopeful looks with his brother and feels happy when Oberyn pins Ser Gregor to the ground with his spear, but his hopes are quickly shattered in the moment when the Mountain knocks Oberyn down and crushes his head, confessing his own war crimes and sealing Tyrion's fate. As Tyrion is struck with horror, Tywin states that the gods have made their will known and Tyrion is sentenced to death.{{Ref|GOT408}}

Tyrion is surprised when Jaime comes to his cell in the night and leads him through a secret passageway within the castle. He tells Tyrion that he will meet with [[Varys]], who has arranged for him to escape to the [[Free Cities]]. The brothers warmly embrace, believing it will be the last time they see each other. Jaime leaves him with a familial kiss on the cheek. Instead of proceeding directly to his liaison, Tyrion first enters the chambers of their father.{{Ref|GOT410}}

[[File:Tyrionkillshae_(1).jpg|thumb|Tyrion kills Shae after finding her in Tywin's bed.]]
He finds a woman in his father's bed, and is shocked to discover that it is [[Shae]], moaning Tywin's name and calling for her "lion," the name she had previously called Tyrion. When Shae spots him, she grabs a paring knife and tries to stab him. She fails to do so but slaps him and scratches at his face. They struggle, and Tyrion eventually strangles her with Tywin's gold chain she is wearing. The act is done both in self-defense and in jealous rage, and Tyrion is immediately distraught once he fully realizes what he has done.{{Ref|GOT410}}

[[File:The children Tyrion with Bow S4.png|thumb|Tyrion kills his father.]]
After apologizing to Shae's corpse, he takes Joffrey's crossbow and confronts his father while in his privy chamber. He forces his father to admit to his many wrongdoings against him. Tywin tries to placate Tyrion, saying he admires Tyrion's will to survive but when he refers to Shae as a "whore" once too often after having been warned not to do so on pain of death, Tyrion kills him with two bolts to the chest. He proceeds to the chamber of Lord Varys, who stows him away within a crate upon a ship, and decides to accompany him at the last moment.{{Ref|GOT410}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[File:GOT Season 5 02.jpg|thumb|Tyrion arrives in Pentos.]]
With the aid of Varys, Tyrion is brought to the home of [[Illyrio Mopatis]] in [[Pentos]]. Varys attempts to persuade Tyrion to assist in his goal to restore [[House Targaryen]] to the Iron Throne, but Tyrion simply wishes to drink himself to death after all that he has been through, renouncing his lordship and caring nothing for the stability of Westeros, a country he is done with after nothing but pain from its politics.{{Ref|GOT501}}

[[File:Wars_to_come_tyrion_varys_pentos.jpg|thumb|Varys and Tyrion in Pentos.]]
Later, Tyrion questions Varys on his motives for setting him free. Varys reveals his brother Jaime had asked him to and that he did for the benefit of the Seven Kingdoms. Varys then states that his goal was to bring peace and prosperity upon the kingdoms where those without power would never be prey to those who do; Tyrion merely states in a jaded tone that the former will always become prey to the latter, which is how the powerful become and stay that way in the first place, rising to power by taking advantage of those weaker than themselves. The two discuss that the Seven Kingdoms needs a ruler stronger than [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]], but gentler than [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]. Tyrion wishes Varys luck on trying to find the right man, but Varys makes Tyrion one final offer. Varys tells him that he can simply drink himself to death here in Pentos, or ride with him to [[Meereen]] to meet [[Daenerys Targaryen]]. After a moment, Tyrion agrees.{{Ref|GOT501}}

[[File:Tyrion_-1_(S05E02).jpg|thumb|Tyrion and Varys discuss on their way to Meereen.]]
Tyrion and Varys depart Pentos in a large carriage. Tyrion remains despondent, and as he promised, he is continuing to drink himself into a stupor. Varys explains that they are traveling to Meereen by way of [[Volantis]]. Varys points out that Tyrion was an effective ruler when he was acting Hand of the King, and that each of them were outsiders due to their deformities (a [[eunuch]] and a [[dwarf]]). They enjoyed accumulating power, he says, but they also wall themselves off from other people, like hiding inside of a large carriage as they are now - but deep down, they were never satisfied being separate from society. Tyrion remains depressed and continues to insist that he's tired of being confined in a box of some sort. Varys, however, again warns him that he must remain hidden and it is unsafe to be seen publicly: Cersei has promised a lordship to any man who brings her his head. Tyrion scoffs and rhetorically asks if Cersei is going to kill every dwarf in the world in the hope of eventually catching him.{{Ref|GOT502}} 

[[File:503 Volantis sign writing 4.png|thumb|Tyrion and Varys walk along the Long Bridge.]]
After days of confinement in the carriage, an impatient Tyrion eventually opts to get through Volantis on foot. The pair move through the [[Long Bridge]]'s markets, where Varys explains the meaning of the various tattoos Volantene slaves must sport. Varys nearly loses Tyrion, but finds him observing the sermon of a [[Red priestess (High Sparrow)|red priestess]]. Tyrion says he is curious, since [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]] was the only [[red priest]] in King's Landing. The red priestess evangelizes in [[High Valyrian]], telling the tale of how she was once a slave herself. She preaches of a [[Prince That Was Promised|prophesied savior]], a Dragon Queen. Tyrion's interest in the scene wanes when the Priestess stares directly into his eyes.{{Ref|GOT503}}

[[File:Tyrion_&_Jorah_(S05E03).jpg|thumb|Tyrion is captured by Jorah on a brothel in Volantis.]]
Tyrion next leads Varys to a brothel. Catching sight of a [[Mother of Dragons (High Sparrow)|prostitute dressed as Daenerys]], Varys tells Tyrion that a woman who inspires both sermons and whores is probably worth meeting. Tyrion woos a [[Clea|dark-haired prostitute]], but when she finally agrees to service him, he finds that he can't bring himself to patronize her. He then goes to urinate off the side of the bridge, with Varys losing sight of him. As Tyrion finishes, he is abducted by Jorah Mormont, who declares that he is taking him to "the queen."{{Ref|GOT503}}

[[File:Jorah kidnaps Tyrion sons of the harpy.jpg|thumb|Tyrion is held hostage by Jorah.]]
Now at the mercy of his captor, Tyrion is thrown into a stolen boat by Jorah and they set sail for [[Meereen]]. En route, Tyrion pesters Jorah with muffled whining until he relents and removes Tyrion's gag. Tyrion notices that they are traveling east and not west towards Cersei in King's Landing. Jorah reveals that he is taking Tyrion to the queen he serves, Daenerys Targaryen. Tyrion is pleasantly surprised and tries to convince Jorah that they are on the same side since he was traveling to meet Daenerys anyway. He accurately deduces who Jorah is by his appearance and equipment, and correctly assumes that Jorah must have been banished by Daenerys because she discovered that he was spying on her for Varys. Tyrion mockingly asks Jorah if he really believes that he will earn a pardon for simply delivering him to Daenerys, believing the opposite outcome just as likely. Fed up with his captive, Jorah strikes Tyrion across the face to keep him quiet.{{Ref|GOT504}}

[[File:Tyrion Kill the Boy.jpg|thumb|Tyrion travels through Old Valyria.]]
As Jorah and Tyrion continue their journey to Meereen, and following Jorah's violent reaction to a previous conversation, Tyrion tries to civilize their relationship and asks where they are. As Jorah stands up to look at the foggy ruins on the horizon, Tyrion deduces that they are going to pass through the remains of Old Valyria, a shorter route to Meereen and one which pirates will avoid because of Valyria's reputation. Tyrion is apprehensive, but still excited to see the ruins of what was once the greatest civilization in the world. As they catch glimpses of domes, towers and aqueducts, Tyrion recites a poem about the Doom of Valyria, with Jorah joining in at the end. Suddenly, through the fog, they see Drogon fly into view. Although he had been hearing about the dragons for some time, Tyrion is still awed to see one in person - though the beast does not notice them.{{Ref|GOT505}}

[[File:Stonemen attack.jpg|thumb|Tyrion is attacked by Stone Men en route to Meereen.]]
They are suddenly attacked by [[Stone Men]], men whose [[greyscale]] infection has reached its pinnacle and transformed them into feral monsters. During the fight, Tyrion falls overboard and dragged under by a stone man, but he is rescued by Jorah and they make it to a beach, where Tyrion regains consciousness. Jorah finally frees Tyrion from his binds and notices that none of the stone men managed to touch him. Tyrion thanks Jorah for saving his life, and they decide to seek out a fishing village to acquire another boat, or walk the rest of the way to Meereen. Jorah tells Tyrion to get some rest as he goes for firewood, but unbeknownst to Tyrion, Jorah has been infected with greyscale.{{Ref|GOT505}}

[[File:Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken 04.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion tells Jorah about his father's death.]]
Tyrion and Jorah continue their quest to Meereen on foot. Tyrion is annoyed that they didn't find any villages to steal a boat or supplies from as Jorah had hoped, so they're slowly walking and only have berries and roots to eat. The topic of just why Tyrion was even in Volantis comes up, and Tyrion is surprised that Jorah did not ask earlier: he explains that he actually ''fled'' from Westeros because he killed his own father. He says he did it because his father tried to have him executed for a crime he didn't commit, and then he found his father screwing the woman he loved. Tyrion then says that despite how miserable Jorah is now, at least he can say that he had a good father. Jorah asks how he could have known his father Jeor Mormont, but Tyrion explains he visited the Wall once and met him: he was a great leader who seemed to genuinely care about all of his men, a rare thing in the world, but now as the eulogy for Night's Watch members goes, "the world will not see his like again." Jorah is shocked to realize he means that his father is dead. Tyrion becomes apologetic and says he thought that Jorah knew already. Jorah asks how he died: Tyrion says he only knows the report he heard, which said that his father led an expedition beyond the Wall, but there was a mutiny, and Jeor was murdered by his own men. Jorah processes this in silent grief, then changes the subject by saying that they have to keep moving.{{Ref|GOT506}}

Tyrion openly questions Jorah's motives, and when Jorah claims that he came to believe in Daenerys when he saw her emerge from the fire unharmed with the dragon hatchlings, Tyrion is convinced, but still expresses doubt as to whether or not Daenerys will be a good ruler, given that her family was known for succumbing to [[Targaryen madness|madness]] due to their compound inbreeding, particularly her father, whom many still call the Mad King. However, they are spotted and captured by slavers bound for Volantis. The lead slaver, [[Malko]], deems Tyrion as useless and orders his throat cut and his penis removed to be sold to a cock merchant (as he believes dwarf cocks bring good luck). Tyrion, however, convinces them to do it when they have reached the cock merchant, buying himself some time, and when Malko mentions that Daenerys has re-opened the fighting pits in Meereen, Tyrion successfully convinces Malko to take them to Meereen in order to put Jorah, who is a renowned Westerosi fighter, in the fighting pits and make them rich.{{Ref|GOT506}}

[[File:The Gift 08.jpg|thumb|Tyrion convinces Yezzan to buy him.]]
On the outskirts of Meereen, after Jorah is sold to [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]], Tyrion attempts to convince Yezzan to buy him as well, and viciously beats his captor with his own chain to prove his worth. Yezzan relents and buys Tyrion, but mostly for his comedic value. They are taken to Daznak's pit, a small fighting pit, which will celebrate the opening of the games. When they hear that Daenerys is present, Jorah immediately enters the fight in the arena, while Tyrion struggles to cut his chain until a guard comes and does it for him. Tyrion enters the arena just as Jorah is being taken away (since Daenerys still hasn't forgiven him), and reveals himself as Jorah's "gift." He introduces himself as Tyrion Lannister, and meets Daenerys face-to-face at last.{{Ref|GOT507}}

[[File:Tyrion-jorah-s5e8.jpg|thumb|Tyrion explains his family tensions to Daenerys.]]
Both Tyrion and Jorah are brought before Daenerys inside the [[Great Pyramid of Meereen]]. Daenerys initially advocates executing Tyrion as revenge against the Lannisters for betraying her family, but Tyrion points out that he killed his mother in childbirth and shot his father in the heart before fleeing. She asks him advice on what to do with Jorah. Tyrion persuades her to spare him, but suggests banishing him again, since he did effectively betray her trust.{{Ref|GOT508}}
 
[[File:TyrionandDaenerys.jpg|thumb|Tyrion and Daenerys discussing matters of family and politics.]]
Later, while having wine, Tyrion and Daenerys agree that they both had cruel fathers, and Tyrion promises to explain why he killed Tywin someday, should she decide to spare him. Tyrion admits that though he believes Daenerys is no better than her father, he admits that he traveled to Meereen because Varys convinced him that she may very well be the best monarch for the Seven Kingdoms. He believes that Varys was correct in his assessment, and notes that Varys is the only person he can trust, aside from his brother Jaime. The mention of Jaime, who killed her father, prompts Daenerys to suggest executing Tyrion, but Tyrion reacts with indifference, claiming that he was ready to drink himself to death in Pentos and still welcomes death if Daenerys prefers it, given the rate of how his own life had become as of late. Daenerys ultimately decides not to kill or banish Tyrion, but to take him as an advisor on how to reclaim the Iron Throne. Tyrion suggests that Daenerys stay in Meereen, as she may do more good in Essos than in Westeros. Daenerys assures Tyrion that she will stay in Meereen to ensure there is no more slavery but states that Essos is not her home. Tyrion counters that no one will support her in Westeros, but Daenerys somewhat idealistically declares that the [[Smallfolk|common people]] will support her.  
Tyrion generously assumes that this will happen (which it generally doesn't), but then he reminds Daenerys that Meereen has been in a state of chaos without the combined support of the Great Masters and the smallfolk, and extends this to Westeros and its [[Great House]]s. He notes that Houses [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] and [[House Stark|Stark]] are effectively dead or scattered due to [[Execution of Rickard and Brandon Stark|the]] [[Sack of King's Landing|combined]] [[Red Wedding|actions]] of their "two terrible fathers." Neither [[House Lannister]] nor [[House Baratheon of Dragonstone]] will ever support her claim in light of their histories with the Targaryens. Tyrion says that leaves [[House Tyrell]], who originally sided with the Crown in [[Robert's Rebellion]] and ''might'' be willing to help her due to Cersei's recent schemes against them, but that it still isn't enough. Daenerys stubbornly likens the Great Houses, including her own House Targaryen, to spokes on a wheel: one on top of the others, and on and on, crushing the commoners beneath them in their struggle for supremacy. Tyrion sarcastically warns that others have dreamt of stopping the wheel, but Daenerys clarifies that she isn't planning to stop the wheel, she intends to ''break'' it.{{Ref|GOT508}}

[[File:Daario-s5e9.jpg|thumb|Daenerys, Hizdahr and Tyrion discuss the brutality of tradition.]]
Tyrion attends the opening of the Great Games in Daznak's Pit along with Daenerys, [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]], [[Daario Naharis]], and [[Missandei]]. He playfully banters with Hizdahr and Daario about which fighters will win owing to what advantages, such as strength or speed, and after Hizdahr lectures Daenerys about the requisitions of holding onto power, Tyrion coldly quips that Tywin would have liked him. In the second round of the games, Jorah appears as one of the combatants and is almost killed. Tyrion urges Daenerys to stop the games before Jorah is killed, but he is saved by another fighter.{{Ref|GOT509}}

[[File:Daario2-s5e9.jpg|thumb|Tyrion is left struck with awe as Daenerys escapes the pit on her dragon.]]
Suddenly, a surprise attack by the [[Sons of the Harpy]] devastates the fighting pit. Tyrion saves Missandei by killing one of the Sons and he runs with Daenerys and the others into the center of the fighting pit, where they are surrounded. He later watches in obvious shock when [[Drogon]] enters the pit and sets several Sons ablaze. When Daenerys flies off on Drogon's back, Tyrion is left struck with awe as he watches her fly through the sky on dragon back.{{Ref|GOT509}}
 
[[File:Mother’s Mercy 01.jpg|thumb|Jorah, Daario, and Tyrion lament the whereabouts of Daenerys.]]
In the aftermath, Tyrion sits in the throne room with Daario and Jorah. Grey Worm recovers and Missandei introduces him to Tyrion. Tyrion concludes that since Drogon flew North, he and Daario must head in that direction if they are to find Daenerys, getting into an argument with Jorah over his status as a Lannister and Jorah having betrayed and been exiled twice by Daenerys. Daario breaks up the argument, convincing Tyrion to trust Jorah and allow him to come, since he did save Daenerys in the fighting pit, but at the same time questions Tyrion's skills in tracking and combat and deeming him unfit to join in such a dangerous mission. Instead, Daario advises Tyrion to stay in Meereen and rule on Daenerys's behalf, knowing of his political skills from his time as Hand of the King, with Grey Worm enforcing Tyrion's rule with the Unsullied and Missandei as interpreter, wishing him luck on keeping the city together.{{Ref|GOT510}}

[[File:Tyrion-varys-meereen.png|thumb|Tyrion and Varys watch over Meereen]]
Later on, Tyrion, from atop the pyramid, watches Daario and Jorah depart Meereen to find Daenerys. He is joined by Varys, who playfully teases him for "abandoning" him and admits he found him through his little birds. Varys congratulates Tyrion for winning Daenerys's favor without him. Varys alludes to the political instability in Meereen, and the opportunities it presents for Tyrion. Through their bantering, they vow to help each other hold Meereen together. Tyrion then wholeheartedly admits that he missed Varys.{{Ref|GOT510}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
[[File:The Red Woman 08.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion and Varys stroll the streets of Meereen.]]
In an effort to find the Sons of the Harpy, Tyrion and Varys explore the streets of Meereen disguised as merchants, believing they can do more at street level than inside the Great Pyramid. Upon meeting a woman and her baby, Tyrion offers some money to feed her child. Due to his bad Valyrian, however, she refuses, believing Tyrion intends to eat her baby until Varys corrects her. While pondering their predicament and what Daenerys' absence means to the people of Meereen, they witness [[Zanrush]] preaching to some of the former slaves to fight for their own freedom instead of relying on Daenerys. After surmising that the Harpies have a leader, Tyrion and Varys encounter several citizens running away from something. Investigating the disturbance, they are shocked to find that the Sons of the Harpy have burned every ship in the harbor.{{Ref|GOT601}}

[[File:Home 18.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion decides to visit Viserion and Rhaegal.]]
Later, in the Great Pyramid, Tyrion learns that the Unsullied have yet to find the person responsible for burning the Meereenese fleet, Astapor and Yunkai have fallen back into the slave trade and Daenerys' remaining [[dragon]]s haven't been eating since their mother left. Tyrion guesses that they are morose because they are in captivity. When Missandei asks how he knows this, he replies, "That's what I do. I drink and I know things." Tyrion decides to meet the dragons and free them, knowing they will be better off this way.{{Ref|GOT602}}

Accompanied by Varys, Tyrion ventures alone into the catacombs and encounters [[Viserion]] and [[Rhaegal]] for the first time. Despite their initial hostility towards him, Tyrion remains calm, assuring them he is a friend of Daenerys and only wants to help. He manages to earn their trust and unshackle them, all the while telling them the story of how he wanted a dragon for his [[nameday]] when asked by his uncle what he'd like for a gift, only to be disappointed by uproarious laughter from his family and the truth from his father, that they'd been extinct for a century. After the dragons depart, Tyrion quickly exits the pit with Varys, asking the eunuch to punch him 'in the face' the next time he has a crazy idea.{{Ref|GOT602}}

[[File:Tyrion, Missandei, and Grey Worm Season 6.jpg|thumb|Tyrion tries to initiate small talk with Missandei and Grey Worm. ]]
Later, while waiting for Varys as he turns one of the Sons of the Harpy's [[Vala|allies]] to their cause, Tyrion tries to pass the time with Missandei and Grey Worm by engaging in small talk and playing one of his drinking games, without success. Once Varys arrives, Tyrion learns that the Masters of Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis are collectively funding the Sons of the Harpy. In order to intimidate the Masters into backing down, Tyrion asks Varys to arrange a meeting with them.{{Ref|GOT603}}

[[File:Book of the Stranger 03.jpg|thumb|Tyrion invites Daenerys's enemies to Meereen.]]
Tyrion, Grey Worm, Missandei and Varys prepare to meet with representatives of the [[Good Masters]] of [[Astapor]], the [[Wise Masters]] of [[Yunkai]], and the slave-trading city of [[Volantis]], who have all arrived by sea. As the diplomatic mission enters the harbor, Grey Worm advocates using military force, though Tyrion reminds him this has already been tried, and this time they must "make peace with our enemies." When Tyrion explains that he is able to empathize with slaves because he spent one day as a slave, Missandei counters that he has not experienced slavery enough.{{Ref|GOT604}}

[[File:Book of the Stranger 20.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion discusses negotiations with the slave masters. ]]
In the meeting chamber, the emissaries are revealed to be Tyrion's former slave master [[Yezzan zo Qaggaz]], the Yunkai'i Wise Master [[Razdal mo Eraz]], and the Volantene representative [[Belicho Paenymion]]. Yezzan remarks at how Tyrion, a dwarf slave, has quickly climbed to the top of the Great Pyramid. The slave-trading cities offer to give Daenerys and her allies a large amount of money and ships if they leave [[Slaver's Bay]]. When Missandei defends Dany's actions in liberating slaves, Razdal contends that slavery has existed in the region for centuries. After hearing their offer and reminding them there are other ways to make money, Tyrion proposes a counter-offer. While Meereen would remain a free city, he offers to give the other cities of Slaver's Bay a seven-year time limit to phase out slavery and compensate all slave owners. However, they must end all support for the Sons of the Harpy, regardless of their denial of it. He then cautions them that they will not get a better offer. At the meeting's conclusion, Tyrion gives them a trio of prostitutes and time to consider his offer.{{Ref|GOT604}}

Tyrion and his entourage are later confronted by a group of former slaves in the Meereen throne room. A [[Kesh|freedman]] demands to know when Daenerys will return, while [[Ash|another]] is appalled at the idea of Tyrion negotiating with slave traders. Tyrion insists he is doing his best to rule the city in her absence while they wait. Instead, the freedmen refuse to listen to the foreign dwarf and look to Grey Worm and Missandei for reassurance. Despite their misgivings, they both publicly back Tyrion in front of the freedmen.{{Ref|GOT604}}

In private, Tyrion assures Missandei and Grey Worm that he is serving Daenerys' interest by taking advantage of the Masters' own arrogance, but that he cannot end slavery overnight. Grey Worm, however, warns Tyrion that the slavers cannot be reasoned with and will most likely take advantage of him instead, since they already do it for a living.{{Ref|GOT604}}

[[File:The Door 16.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion acquires religious support.]]
Nevertheless, the situation in Meereen begins to stabilize, with almost no incidents involving the Freedmen or Sons of the Harpy, though Tyrion reminds them they need to convince the Meereenese that everything has been done with Daenerys' blessing, as the Masters could use Tyrion and Varys' foreign status against them to fully reclaim Slaver's Bay. To accomplish this, Tyrion invites [[Kinvara]], High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, to negotiate spreading the word of Daenerys's achievements. To Tyrion's surprise, Kinvara appears to fully agree with supporting Tyrion's goals, believing that Daenerys is the [[Prince That Was Promised]]. Varys is more skeptical, however, being suspicious of any practitioners of magic, and points out that [[Melisandre]] had already promised the same to [[Stannis Baratheon]], who was ultimately [[Battle of the Blackwater|defeated]] and [[Battle in the ice|killed]]. Kinvara counters that the Lord of Light's human followers occasionally make mistakes, then shuts him down with knowledge of his castration. Kinvara then assures Tyrion that she will send the preachers and priests best suited to the task at hand.{{Ref|GOT605}}

[[File:No One 05.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion bids Varys farewell.]]
When the red priests arrive at Meereen to preach about Daenerys, Tyrion and Varys are debating if their presence can maintain order throughout the city while walking through the markets. Afterwards, Varys tells Tyrion that he is leaving on a secret expedition because Daenerys will need more allies, before Tyrion proclaims to Varys that he is the most famous dwarf in the world.{{Ref|GOT608}}

In the Great Pyramid, Tyrion wishes to celebrate with Missandei and Grey Worm for the resurgence of Meereen and to honor their queen. Their celebration is cut short when a large fleet of slaver ships lay siege to the city. As the slavers continue to bombard Meereen, Tyrion allows Grey Worm to assume command. Grey Worm proposes that the Unsullied must not go to the beach, preferring to wait until the slavers enter the Great Pyramid. At that moment, they hear movement on the roof. When they go to investigate, they discover that Daenerys has returned on her dragon [[Drogon]].{{Ref|GOT608}}

The following day, Tyrion explains the events in Meereen during her absence to Daenerys. Despite the fact that they are under siege by the Masters' fleet, he believes that his success in bringing about a resurgence of a slaveless Meereen is the reason for their attack, because the Masters could not let such an example succeed for fear that their slaves could rise up. Daenerys declares that she will destroy the Masters' armies, kill them all, and destroy their cities. Tyrion disapproves and explains the similarities between this plan and the one her father had for King's Landing when the Lannisters were at his door. Instead, he proposes a different solution.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Battle of the Bastards 25.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion joins Daenerys in negotiations.]]
Accompanied by Grey Worm and Missandei, Tyrion and Daenerys meet with the slave masters Razdal, Yezzan, and Belicho to parley. Believing victory is near, the slave masters demand that Daenerys and Tyrion surrender Missandei and the Unsullied to their masters, and her three dragons to be slaughtered before leaving Slaver's Bay. Dany rejects their terms and orders Drogon, Viserion, and Rhaegal to burn the slavers' fleet. As Dany leads the counterattack on the back of Drogon, Tyrion chastises the slave masters for breaking his pact and demands that they surrender one of their own to be executed as punishment. When Razdal and Belicho try to offer up Yezzan, Tyrion orders Grey Worm to kill the two masters. However, he spares Yezzan so Yezzan can spread the word of Daenerys's power. Meanwhile, Dany's [[Dothraki]] horde wipes out the resurgent Sons of the Harpy.{{Ref|GOT609}}

After the battle, Tyrion is present at the Great Pyramid while Dany holds an audience with [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] and [[Theon Greyjoy]], who have just arrived in Meereen with most of the [[Iron Fleet]]. Knowing Theon, Tyrion chides him for mocking his height back at [[Winterfell]] and for the alleged murders of [[Bran Stark|Bran]] and [[Rickon Stark]]. A penitent Theon reiterates that he has paid for his crimes though Tyrion is incredulous given that Theon is standing there. Yara offers to provide Daenerys with a hundred ships if she helps them to defeat her uncle [[Euron Greyjoy]] and recognizes the independence of the [[Iron Islands]]. Tyrion protests that if the Iron Islands gain independence, then the rest of the Kingdoms will likely make that demand as well; Dany states that they are welcome to try, and agrees to Yara's terms, provided that the Ironborn end all reaving and piracy of the mainland. When Yara begrudgingly accepts, Tyrion indicates his approval of the alliance, as Daenerys has negotiated a strong position for herself.{{Ref|GOT609}}

[[File:Game-of-thrones-season-6-winds-of-winter-image-2.jpeg|thumb|Dany and Tyrion discuss her lack of sentimentality.]]
In preparation for the invasion of Westeros and entering its politics, Tyrion advises Daenerys to end her relationship with Daario and leave him Meereen with the rest of the [[Second Sons]], which she does. Tyrion attempts to console her on her loss of the relationship but admits he is not good at consoling. She agrees but she says she is more bothered that it was so easy for her to let Daario go than by the actual loss of the relationship. Tyrion tells her that Daario is not the only man she ever loved and definitely will not be the last. He also implies that she already has the needed mind set for the terrifying game she is about to play with the lords of Westeros.{{Ref|GOT610}}

[[File:Game-of-thrones-season-6-tyrion.jpeg|thumb|180x180px|Daenerys makes Tyrion her Hand.]]
Tyrion goes on to admit that for years he has believed in nothing but, in the months in her service, he has come to believe in Daenerys and that he is ready to live again. Touched, Daenerys presents him with a replica of the Hand's brooch and formally names him Hand of the Queen. Moved to near-tears, Tyrion kneels before her. Some time later, Tyrion stands with Daenerys on the flagship of her massive armada, looking ahead to returning to Westeros.{{Ref|GOT610}}

News of Tyrion's appointment as Hand to Daenerys has also reached King's Landing, news which Cersei breaks to Jaime when they make a list of their enemies.{{Ref|GOT701}}

[[File:GoT-Sn7 FirstLook 15.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion arrives on Dragonstone.]]
Tyrion arrives on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], accompanied by [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], [[Missandei]], [[Varys]], and [[Grey Worm]]. He follows [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] from the shore of the island to the [[Painted Table]] of [[Westeros]], pulling down the standard of [[Stannis Baratheon]] and running her hands along the simplistically ornate throne before asking if they can begin planning [[Last War|her conquest]].{{Ref|GOT701}}

As they begin planning for the conquest of Westeros, Tyrion cautions Daenerys not to launch a direct assault on the city with her dragons or she will merely become Queen of the ashes, to which Daenerys concurs. Tyrion witnesses as Daenerys calls into question Varys's allegiance, as his loyalty has shifted from king to king since the days when he served her father. The Hand tries to defend his friend, insisting that Varys had been the one to convince him over to their cause and that he had served her well since then, assisting his rule of Meereen and securing the alliance of [[Dorne]] and [[House Tyrell]]. However, Daenerys demands that Varys explain himself without support from Tyrion, who watches as the Spider swears that he will be loyal to her as long as she keeps the people's best interests at heart. Daenerys requests that Varys not conspire against her if she should fail and that he try his hardest to dissuade her.{{Ref|GOT702}}

Grey Worm announces the arrival of Melisandre, who brings them news of events in the North and Jon Snow's coronation as King, to Tyrion's surprise. Although somewhat skeptical of Melisandre's prophecies, Tyrion admits that he liked and trusted Jon's character when they traveled to the Wall together, and encourages Daenerys to make an alliance with him.{{Ref|GOT702}}

[[File:Stormborn Dany's Council.jpg|thumb|Tyrion clashes with Ellaria during Daenerys's council meeting.]]
Tyrion later joins Daenerys for a council of war with Missandei, Varys, Grey Worm, Olenna Tyrell, the Greyjoy siblings and Ellaria Sand. Tyrion initially clashes with Ellaria, as he knows she poisoned his niece Myrcella and she blames him indirectly for Oberyn's death. After Daenerys stops their argument, Tyrion helps her explain their plan to invade Westeros: as Cersei is trying to rally the Lords to defend King's Landing against a foreign army, Daenerys' Unsullied and Dothraki will not attack the city or they will "prove her point."{{Ref|GOT702}}

[[File:Game-of-thrones-season-7-stormborn-image-6.jpg|thumb|Tyrion explains his tactics.]]
Instead, the Greyjoy fleet will ferry the Dornish army north to lay siege to King's Landing alongside the Tyrell forces, trapping Cersei and most of her army in the capitol and starving them out. Meanwhile, in response to Olenna's question of the use of Daenerys's foreign soldiers, Tyrion plans to have the Unsullied sail around Westeros and capture Casterly Rock, the true seat of House Lannister's power. Ellaria, Yara Greyjoy and Olenna agree to follow this plan. All does not go as planned, however; on their way to Dorne, Yara's fleet is [[Assault on the Targaryen fleet|decimated]] by her uncle [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron]]'s Iron Fleet, and both she and Ellaria are captured.{{Ref|GOT702}}

[[File:Tyrion Blue Rocks.jpg|thumb|Tyrion meets with Jon Snow, now King in the North.]]
Tyrion is later seen meeting with Jon Snow, Davos Seaworth, and their men, as they arrive in a small boat onto the shores of Dragonstone. Tyrion teases Jon, calling him "the bastard of Winterfell", to which Jon retorts, calling Tyrion "the dwarf of Casterly Rock." They greet each other warmly and seem to be happy to see each other again, exchanging friendly barbs back and forth. Jon and his party are then forced to surrender their weapons, and they reluctantly do so. Then, as the party is escorted towards the castle, a group of Daenerys' soldiers whisk away their boat. Jon and Davos exchange looks of concern at this.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:Walk to Dragonstone TQJ.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion escorts the Northern party to Daenerys.]]
As they make their way up the castle steps, Jon and Tyrion have a conversation about how they got to their respective positions, and how Jon's followers must think he's crazy for going to Dragonstone. Tyrion concurs, stating that if he were Jon's advisor, he would have advised against it, and cites that going south doesn't usually work out well for the Starks, to which Jon swiftly replies that he is not a Stark. They are then suddenly interrupted when Drogon swoops down towards them, and everyone is forced to duck for cover. Jon takes a moment to recover from the sudden shock, as the party continues on their journey towards the castle.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:703 Tyrion.jpg|thumb|Daenerys's forward nature towards Jon worries Tyrion.]]
As they reach the throne room, Jon and Davos begin to speak with Daenerys as Tyrion watches by her side. The meeting is very tense as both sides refuse to submit to the other's demands. Tyrion plays an important moderating role by vouching for Jon's integrity and character, helping to soften Daenerys' attitude towards the insistent and unbowing King in the North. As the meeting is about to end on an unfavorable note, Tyrion urges Jon to simply bend the knee, reasoning that if Westeros is doomed by the threat of White Walkers, it makes no difference who he supports for the Iron Throne, especially if it will help him further his goals.{{Ref|GOT703}}

[[File:703 TQJ.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion speaks with Jon in private.]]
The meeting is interrupted by Varys who delivers news about their decimated Greyjoy fleet. Dany allows Jon and Davos to stay as "guests" until they can reach a proper agreement. Later, Tyrion meets with Jon on the grounds of Dragonstone. Jon is unhappy that he is a prisoner while the Night King and White Walkers still pose a threat. Tyrion encourages a despondent Jon not to give up and confides that he trusts the word of Jon and [[Jeor Mormont]]. Tyrion also vouches for his Queen and reassures Jon that she is not like her father. Tyrion also asks Jon if there is something he can do to help. Jon tells Tyrion about the vein of [[dragonglass]] beneath Dragonstone.{{Ref|GOT703}}

Tyrion manages to convince a skeptical Dany to allow Jon to mine the dragon glass on the pretext that it will win her an ally. Dany grants Jon permission to mine the dragon glass and outfits him with the manpower and equipment to do so. At the Chamber of the Painted Table, Tyrion along with Varys and Missandei discuss [[Euron Greyjoy]]'s destruction of Yara's fleet. Tyrion and Missandei argue against Daenerys' plan to lead her dragons on a mission to hunt and destroy Euron's fleet, opining that she faces the prospect of death. Tyrion then elaborates his plan to seize Casterly Rock using an underground tunnel. Grey Worm uses this tunnel to capture Casterly Rock, only to discover that the Lannisters have withdrawn the bulk of their forces. Euron's [[Iron Fleet]] attacks the Targaryen ships, trapping the Unsullied at Casterly Rock.{{Ref|GOT703}}

Varys and Tyrion inform Daenerys that the Unsullied succeeded in capturing Casterly Rock, only to then reveal the disaster which just occurred at [[Highgarden]] as Tyrion's military strategy fell apart. Daenerys is furious and struggles to keep her temper, as now all three of her major allies in Westeros are gone and all she has gained is a castle with no supplies. She snaps at Tyrion, blaming his cautious strategy for losing them Dorne, the Iron Islands (Yara's forces), and now the Reach. She then accuses Tyrion of wanting to use a light hand against the Lannisters because they're his own people. Tyrion insists that they still have just enough ships left to at least shuttle the Dothraki from Dragonstone to the nearby mainland coast; even with the loss of all her other allies, her combined Unsullied/Dothraki forces are still the largest single army in Westeros. Daenerys fumes that her vast numbers are useless if she can't feed them all, as that was the Reach's true strategic value. Daenerys decides she has had enough of clever plans, declaring she will use the Dothraki ''and'' her dragons in a direct assault on the Red Keep to destroy her enemies. Tyrion urges her against this and when Daenerys asks Jon Snow for his input, he agrees with Tyrion to not attack King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT704}}

Daenerys decides to attack the Lannister army en route to [[King's Landing]] following their victory at the [[Sack of Highgarden]], which would destroy expenses retrieved in the process, atop [[Drogon]]. Tyrion is present when she attacks the Lannister forces outside King's Landing during the [[Battle of the Goldroad]], watching miserable as the [[Dothraki]] massacre his kinsmen. When Drogon is injured and is forced to land, Tyrion watches in horror as Jaime foolishly charges at Daenerys on the battlefield and nearly incinerated by Drogon, before being saved by [[Bronn]].{{Ref|GOT704}}

In the aftermath of the battle, Tyrion examines the damage on the battlefield and is present when Daenerys offers the surviving Lannister and Tarly men a choice: kneel or die. When [[Randyll Tarly]] refuses, Tyrion is quick to point out Randyll's newfound loyalty to Cersei, despite her role in annihilating House Tyrell. Randyll, in turn, denounces Tyrion and ''his'' loyalty to Daenerys, viewing her as a foreign invader. Despite Tyrion's insistence that Randyll and [[Dickon Tarly]] be imprisoned or sent to the Wall, Daenerys ignores his advice, explaining that they already made their choice, and orders Drogon to burn them alive.{{Ref|GOT705}}

Back at Dragonstone, Tyrion discusses the aftermath of the battle with Varys. Though confident that Daenerys is not her father, Varys suggests that Tyrion find a way to make her listen to his advice. When Tyrion notices a message in his hand, Varys says that it is for Jon. At Daenerys' subsequent council meeting, Tyrion suggests capturing a Wight north of the Wall and bringing it back to Cersei as proof of their true common enemy. To convince Cersei to stand down, however, he must first appeal to Jaime. Davos agrees to smuggle Tyrion into King's Landing, but warns him of the consequences should the [[City Watch of King's Landing|gold cloaks]] recognize him.{{Ref|GOT705}}

Arriving at a secluded beach close to the Red Keep, Tyrion remarks that he murdered his own father the last time he was in King's Landing, with Davos remarking that Tyrion [[Battle of the Blackwater|murdered]] his [[Matthos Seaworth|son]] the last time ''he'' visited the city. With time short, Tyrion makes his way inside. In the cellar beneath the Red Keep, Bronn arranges the meeting in the guise of a secret sparring session. Tyrion commends Jaime for outsmarting him at the siege of Casterly Rock, then does his best to explain his true motivations for murdering their father. When Jaime demands to know the real reason for the meeting, Tyrion explains that though Daenerys' victory is inevitable, she is genuinely nothing like her father, and has a more important request for Cersei.{{Ref|GOT705}}

Upon returning to the beach, Tyrion spots two Gold Cloaks near Davos's boat, and is spotted in return. Before the guards can arrest him, however, Davos's [[Gendry Baratheon|companion]] quickly dispatches them. After Tyrion is introduced to Gendry, the three make their escape. Tyrion later reunites with Jorah Mormont, his former traveling companion, and reminisces over their journey to Meereen, after which Tyrion gives Jorah the coin used to pay for him by Yezzan, hoping it will bring him luck for the [[wight hunt]].{{Ref|GOT705}}

[[File:Tyrion.PNG|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion says Jon is in love with Dany.]]
Later, he and Daenerys discuss heroism, Daenerys telling him he is no hero. Tyrion disagrees, and tries to explain how he received his scar by charging through the Mud Gate. Daenerys interrupts him, stating she doesn't want him to be a hero, as they do stupid things and end up dead. She names Drogo, Daario Naharis, Jorah Mormont and Jon Snow as examples, which Tyrion notes, stating all four of these men fell in love with her. Daenerys says Jon Snow doesn't love her, to which Tyrion responds sarcastically he only stares at her longingly because he is hopeful for a successful military alliance. When Daenerys calls Jon too little for her, Tyrion says that as far as heroes go, he is quite little. Daenerys then says she knows Tyrion is brave, as she wouldn't have chosen a coward as her hand.{{Ref|GOT706}}

[[File:Tyrion-Daenerys-Beyond-the-Wall.jpg|thumb|Daenerys and Tyrion discuss the usage of fear.]]
Daenerys changes the subject, by saying if the wight hunt goes well, she'll finally get to meet Cersei, who wants to kill her. Tyrion notes that she would probably torture her first. He vows that if they go to the capital, they will go with the full capacity of their forces, and if someone even touches her, they'll burn the city to the ground. Daenerys says she's probably planning a trap, but Tyrion notes that Cersei is probably thinking the very same thing about Daenerys. When Daenerys asks him if they should lay a trap, Tyrion says it would be better to build a new world without mass murder. Daenerys remarks that no war was won without it, which Tyrion agrees but states that fear alone isn't the right way of ruling.{{Ref|GOT706}}

[[File:706 Tyrion Daenerys.jpg|thumb|Tyrion tells Daenerys of his loyalty to her.]]
When Dany says Aegon Targaryen got quite a long way with fear, Tyrion reminds her of her promise of breaking the wheel, which Aegon built. Tyrion then speaks about his meeting with Jaime, where he promised to keep the Lannister's forces in check if Tyrion makes sure Daenerys doesn't lose her temper. Daenerys responds she does not lose her temper, to which Tyrion replies she lost it when she killed the Tarlys. She notes that Tyrion takes his family's side once again. Tyrion says he has to, as the only way to beat them is to think like them.{{Ref|GOT706}}

[[File:TyrionDany.PNG|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion discusses children with Daenerys.]]
He states that he wants to serve Daenerys for the long term, and wants to make sure that, after she is Queen and broken the wheel, it stays broken after her death. He states that Daenerys once said she believes she can't have children, but that there are other ways to name an heir. Daenerys says he's been thinking of her death for quite a while, and angrily reminds him they lost Dorne and Highgarden because of his lack of planning for the short term. Tyrion remains silent as Daenerys says they will discuss this further after she is Queen.{{Ref|GOT706}}

[[File:Tyriondanny.PNG|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion tries to stop Daenerys from going beyond the Wall.]]
When Daenerys receives a letter from Gendry, asking for help with the wight hunt gone wrong, Tyrion tries to stop her from going to the Wall with her dragons, saying she is the most important person in the world, and she can't go to the most dangerous place in the world. He claims the group knew the risk when they left, and Daenerys shouldn't try to save them. When she steps on Drogon, she asks him what he would have her do. Tyrion says that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but if she dies, everything and everyone would be lost. Daenerys reminds him he told her to do nothing once, and having learned the hard way, she won't do this again. Tyrion looks at her as she and her dragons dive off the cliff, heading for the wall.{{Ref|GOT706}}

After Cersei agrees to a [[Dragonpit Summit|summit in the Dragonpit at King's Landing]], Tyrion and Jon arrive in the capital with their various allies, while the Unsullied and the Dothraki amass outside the city walls to attack in case the truce gets broken.  At the harbor, Tyrion, Varys, Missandei, Jon and Davos nervously sail past Euron Greyjoy's fleet.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:707 Qhono Davos Podrick Theon Jon Varys Tyrion Bronn.jpg|thumb|Tyrion leads the Targaryen entourage to the Dragonpit.]]
The group arrives and are escorted to the [[Dragonpit]], the location of the summit. Tyrion reconnects with Bronn, who concedes it is good to see him again. The pair greet [[Podrick Payne]], who had arrived earlier with [[Brienne of Tarth]]. Tyrion reminds Podrick that he is no longer a Westerosi noble after killing Tywin and Bronn that he will always pay more than what Cersei will in return for his service. Bronn rebuffs this, stating that if anything goes wrong during the parley, Cersei will have Bronn to thank for delivering her enemies to King's Landing.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:The Dragon and the Wolf Tyrion and Jon.jpg|thumb|180x180px|Tyrion speaks to Cersei at the parley.]]
When Cersei arrives, she glares hatefully at Tyrion and quickly grows impatient that Daenerys has not come with him - only for Daenerys herself to make a dramatic arrival on dragonback moments later. Tyrion opens the negotiations, but is quickly interrupted by Euron Greyjoy, who mocks him and threatens Theon until Jaime and Cersei shut him down. Tyrion points out that if all they wanted to do was fight each other to the death, they would never have agreed to this meeting. Jon Snow then reveals the threat posed by the Night King and the Army of the Dead. Although Daenerys promises to uphold a truce with the Lannisters until the Night King has been dealt with, Cersei dismisses their claim concerning the Army of the Dead, saying they are simply attempting to strengthen their position while she is standing down. Tyrion replies that they have something to show her, and Sandor Clegane brings out the wight that was captured north of the Wall. Shaken by what she sees, Cersei at first seems willing to accept a truce, but only if Jon Snow agrees to have the North remain neutral and support neither Queen. To Tyrion's dismay, Jon replies that he cannot do so, as he has already declared for Daenerys. In response, Cersei leaves the summit. Furious, Tyrion rebukes Jon for not being able to make a small lie in order to secure them a political and military advantage. He declares that he will go and speak with Cersei alone - despite Daenerys's protests that she will have him murdered - or else they will be right back where they started.{{Ref|GOT707}}

[[File:707 Jaime Tyrion.jpg|thumb|Jaime warns Tyrion of Cersei.]]
Tyrion is escorted into the Tower of the Hand by Gregor Clegane; he meets Jaime outside, who claims he tried to reason with Cersei until she threw him out. Tyrion then meets Cersei inside the same office both he and their [[Tywin Lannister|father]] once occupied, as Hand of the King. Cersei accuses him of having tried to bring down House Lannister from the very beginning. Although she finally acknowledges that Tyrion did ''not'' kill Joffrey, she reminds him that he ''did'' kill their father, and holds him responsible for the deaths of her other children, as she believed no one would have touched Tommen or Myrcella while Tywin was alive. Tyrion truthfully claims he was unaware of Jon's bending the knee to Daenerys and expresses sincere regret for the deaths of his nephew and niece, but Cersei does not care, claiming he destroyed their House's future regardless of his intentions. Angered, Tyrion tries to goad her into having him killed, if she blames him for everything that has befallen her. Cersei looks ready to give the order to Ser Gregor, but reluctantly relents. Tyrion wonders why she allowed him to arrange the peace negotiations in the first place if she didn't expect anything to happen; Cersei turns the question back at him, wondering why he supports Daenerys as loyally as he does. Cersei dismisses Tyrion's assertions that Daenerys is better at controlling her violent impulses than she is. She expresses the horror she felt when she saw the wight, and her desire to keep her loved ones safe from them at any cost. From this and her gestures, Tyrion correctly deduces that she is pregnant with another incestuous child by Jaime.{{Ref|GOT707}}

Tyrion then returns to his allies at the Dragonpit, where they are joined shortly after by his brother and sister. Cersei claims she will agree to the truce and send the Lannister forces north to fight alongside the Starks and the Targaryens. After a discussion at Dragonstone over their journey to the North, Tyrion accompanies his Queen and Jon Snow aboard a ship that will take them to White Harbor. On the voyage, Tyrion witnesses Daenerys allowing Jon into her cabin, where the two of them give in to their mutual attraction and engage in a sexual encounter. Concerned with the possible political consequences for his Queen, Tyrion walks away.{{Ref|GOT707}}

Cersei tasks Bronn with eliminating her brothers if they survive the war against the [[White Walkers]]. Tyrion reaches [[Winterfell]] along with Targaryen forces, in order to assist the [[North]] in the [[Great War]]. When the Northern lords are angry with Jon for giving up his crown to Daenerys, Tyrion speaks up for Jon, saying his efforts managed to secure them the "greatest army the world has ever seen" to defeat the [[Night King]]. However, when Tyrion reveals they allied with Lannister forces, their anger erupts again.{{Ref|GOT801}}

Tyrion finds Sansa for the first time since they last saw each other at Joffrey's wedding and note each other's new titles/ Tyrion calls the wedding "a miserable affair", though Sansa sardonically remarks, "It had its moments." She calls Tyrion out for believing that Cersei will honor the pledge to send the Lannister forces north. She is disappointed in Tyrion, saying she used to think Tyrion was the cleverest man she ever met.{{Ref|GOT801}}

Several days later, Jaime arrives at Winterfell after realizing Cersei wasn't sending her forces to assist them. Tyrion vouches for Jaime, saying he knows him. Daenerys replies, "Like your sister?" but Tyrion explains Jaime came anyway, knowing how he'd be received. Daenerys is furious with Tyrion for not expecting Cersei's betrayal, but is mollified by Jorah. While preparing for the battle, Tyrion, Podrick, Jaime, [[Brienne of Tarth]], [[Tormund]] and [[Davos Seaworth]] engage in drinking, with Jaime knighting Brienne. Tyrion watches the White Walkers' arrival from the battlements of Winterfell.{{Ref|GOT802}}

[[File:DrinkingGame803.jpg|thumb|Tyrion celebrates the defeat of the dead.]]
Tyrion survives the [[Battle of Winterfell]] and some time later, he mocks Jaime for sleeping with a [[Brienne of Tarth|bigger woman]]. They are, however, caught unawares by Bronn, who has been sent by Cersei to kill both her brothers. Tyrion has his nose busted by Bronn who hesitates to kill them, believing Daenerys still has a good chance of winning, and states he has been promised [[Riverrun]] as a reward. Tyrion reminds him of his promise to double the price anyone paid to murder him, and promises to make him the [[Lord of Highgarden]] after the war, upon which he relents.{{Ref|GOT803}}

[[File:King's Landing Gates S8 EP4.jpg|thumb|Tyrion attempts to parley with Cersei.]]
He later takes part in planning the [[Battle of King's Landing]]. He, along with Jon and others, convinces Daenerys in besieging the city instead of using the dragons. After learning of Jon's true parentage from Sansa, he informs Varys about it. All hopes for a peaceful surrender are quickly dashed, after the [[Battle at Dragonstone|Iron Fleet's ambush]] and Cersei having [[Missandei]] executed, even though Tyrion begs Cersei to surrender, for the sake of her unborn child.{{Ref|GOT804}}

[[File:Tyrion & Varys S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Tyrion bids farewell to Varys.]]
While King's Landing is being besieged by the Unsullied, Tyrion returns along with the Queen to Dragonstone. When Jon returns to the Island, Tyrion overhears Varys pleading with him to take the Iron Throne and informs Daenerys about it, though he unsuccessfully begs for forgiveness for the Spider. Tyrion tells Varys he was behind his betrayal being discovered, and bids a final goodbye to him, before he is burnt alive by Drogon.{{Ref|GOT805}}

[[File:Tyrion Fire S8 Ep5.jpg|thumb|Tyrion watches in horror as King's Landing is destroyed.]]
Daenerys, who now believes she can only win Westeros through fear, is seemingly persuaded by Tyrion to stop attacking once King's Landing surrenders. She informs Tyrion that Jaime had been captured while trying to sneak into the city, warning him not to fail her again or it will be the last time. Before the [[Battle of King's Landing]], Tyrion secretly releases Jaime. He convinces him to try to convince Cersei to have the city surrender and flee with her to [[Pentos]] to start a new life, for the sake of their unborn child. He also tearfully thanks Jaime for being the only family member to treat him with love and not as a monster, before the brothers hug. However, Tyrion's plan is foiled when after the city surrenders, Daenerys has Drogon burn King's Landing and raze over the Red Keep, killing Cersei and Jamie in the process. Tyrion stares in absolute horror at the untold destruction of the city.{{Ref|GOT805}}

[[File:Tyrion S8 Ep6.jpg|thumb|Tyrion wanders through the ruined King's Landing.]]
After the destruction of King's Landing, Tyrion, Jon, and Davos walk through the remains of the city, horrified by the devastation. Tyrion decides to go to the Red Keep alone and goes down to the cellars where he discovers the dead bodies of his siblings and tears up. After Daenerys finishes her speech on liberating the whole world, she confronts Tyrion about him freeing his brother. In response, he states that she slaughtered a whole city, and removes his Hand of the Queen brooch before throwing it away in disgust. Daenerys, furious at a further betrayal, orders him arrested.{{Ref|GOT806}}

Jon later visits Tyrion in his cell and they speak of Daenerys's actions. Tyrion admits he was wrong to betray Varys who turned out right all along about her. Jon struggles with what Daenerys has become and wants to believe the war is done, trying to reason out her actions due to the various traumas she suffered but Tyrion tries to make Jon see the threat Daenerys now is. Tyrion tells him, "I know you love her. I love her too, but not as successfully as you, but I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason." Jon reflects, "Love is the death of duty." Tyrion further says that duty is the death of love. He realizes he's asking Jon to do a terrible thing, but tells him it is also the right thing to save the people as Daenerys is now the biggest threat. Tyrion warns Jon that Daenerys will always view him as a threat to her rulership because he is the true heir to the throne. Jon struggles with what Tyrion is asking of him due to his love for Daenerys. Tyrion reminds Jon of his sisters, expressing his belief that they will not [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] to Daenerys. Jon leaves, troubled.{{Ref|GOT806}}

[[File:Imprisoned Tyrion S8 Ep6.jpg|thumb|Tyrion is brought before the Great Council of Westeros.]]
Jon tries but is unable to dissuade Daenerys from her path of destruction and reluctantly [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|assassinates]] her, upon which he is imprisoned. Weeks later, Tyrion is tried in the [[Dragonpit]] by [[Great Council in the Dragonpit|all the Lords of the Seven Kingdoms]]. Tyrion convinces Grey Worm to let the new King of the Seven Kingdoms punish Jon, after the lords of Westeros oppose the Unsullied's desires to punish him. He then asks the gathering that they should choose the new monarch of the Seven Kingdoms and end the war once and for all. After some rejected ideas, he suggests [[Bran Stark]] to be named the new king, because he is the living memory of the world and it is stories that unite people.{{Ref|GOT806}}

Despite concerns that Bran could never sire any children, Tyrion says it is for the better as heirs often don't make good kings. He proposes that all the lords of the Seven Kingdoms choose the new king, which is accepted by all except Sansa. Bran picks Tyrion as his Hand so as to charge him with atoning for his past mistakes in both supporting and committing treason against Bran's [[Daenerys Targaryen|predecessor]]. Grey Worm opposes it initially but relents.{{Ref|GOT806}}

[[File:Jon Exiled S8 Ep6.png|thumb|Tyrion tells Jon of his exile.]]
Later, Tyrion visits Jon and informs him that a compromise has been reached and he is going back to the [[Night's Watch]]. Jon accepts this and asks Tyrion if [[Assassination of Daenerys Targaryen|what he did was right]]. "What ''we'' did," Tyrion corrects. Jon says it doesn't feel right. They bid farewell, Tyrion telling Jon they'll see each other again, saying he wants to "go pissing off the Wall again" after serving for a few years as the Hand. Tyrion reforms the [[Small Council]], now consisting of Bronn, now the [[Lord of Highgarden]], as [[Master of Coin]], Davos as [[Master of Ships]], Sam as [[Grand Maester]] and Brienne as [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]]. He also seems to have retrieved the silver hand brooch that was gifted to him by Daenerys, indicating that despite having ended their relationship on bad terms, he still believed in who she used to be and the wheel she wanted to break.{{Ref|GOT806}}

[[File:Small Council S8 Ep6.jpg|thumb|Tyrion discusses the vacant positions in the reformed Small Council.]]
King Bran however notices the position of Masters of [[Master of War|War]], [[Master of Laws|Laws]] and [[Master of Whisperers|Whisperers]] are vacant, which Tyrion assures will be filled before the king goes away to find Drogon. They then move on to their primary tasks concerning the rehabilitation of King's Landing, providing clean water, food to civilians, the reconstruction of the royal fleet and the ports. As Bronn discusses using some of the Crown's gold to rebuild the city's brothels, which is met with opposition, Tyrion relates how he once brought 'a honeycomb and a jackass into a brothel.'{{Ref|GOT806}}

As the last surviving child of Tywin Lannister, Tyrion has finally become Lord of Casterly Rock, the title his father has been trying to deny him of for so many years.{{Ref|GOT806}}

==Personality==
{{ReferencesSection}}
{{Quote|Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who can make this country a better place. He has the mind for it, he has the will and he has the right last name.|Varys's high opinion of Tyrion.|Mhysa}}
Tyrion is a highly intelligent man who recognized from an early age that his mind was his greatest weapon, due to being born a member of House Lannister with the expectation of upholding his family's noble name, yet lacking the physical attributes possessed by his older siblings. Thus, he has committed himself to possessing a sharp intellect in order to help make up for his dwarfism, and he is frequently able to use his superior intellect to get the better of those who initially look down upon him or weasel his way out of tight situations, though he is not above resorting to using his family name and enormous fortune to bolster his position. He has also shown himself to possess a keen mind for strategy, as is evidenced in his research into defending against sieges and successfully conducting the defense of King's Landing during the Battle of the Blackwater. Tyrion prides himself on his ability to read people as easily as he does books, and he has on many occasions easily gotten the better of not just Joffrey and Cersei but also experienced players such as Littlefinger and Pycelle.

Despite Tyrion's harsh treatment at the hands of others over the years, he has managed to develop a thick skin and is able to brush off others' japes about his short stature; except; when coming from his father. Tyrion advised Jon Snow how to handle his own bastard status, which reflects Tyrion's own approach to life; take your impediment in stride and wear it like armor, so it cannot be used to hurt you. Being born a dwarf and subject to ridicule for most of his life, Tyrion has admittedly developed a soft spot for his fellow outcasts and has shown them kindness, such as having a saddle designed for the crippled Bran Stark allowing him to ride. Being physically weak, Tyrion is also upset; when the helpless are harmed. He was particularly enraged when [[Janos Slynt]] carried out an order to kill a defenseless baby girl, [[Barra]]; because she was one of Robert's bastards and as punishment had him exiled to the [[Wall]]. Tyrion is also genuinely loyal to those; who treat him; with love and respect. He also seems to have a level of honor and dignity that the rest of his family seem to lack; events such as the Red Wedding disgusted him, and he considered them to be crimes, though he did admit that; there was a certain level of "cheating" in war that he is comfortable with, the Red Wedding went beyond that. One of his most interesting and enduring friendships is with the eunuch Varys, the Master of Whisperers. Tyrion and Varys connect on several levels: they are both social lepers because of a physical condition that most people treat with distaste, they are both brilliant intellectuals with a dry sense of humor, they both have a compassionate nature but are capable of being ruthless when necessary, and they are both fond of wine. Although Tyrion and Varys were wary of each other at first, mainly; due to the extreme reputations they both maintained, they have developed trust over the course of their various adventures.

But Tyrion is not without his faults. He tends to overindulge in food, drink and sex in part to self-medicate for the terrible treatment he had suffered most of his life; when overly stressed, upset or uncomfortable, he will quickly find the nearest container of wine or beer and consume most of it. Tyrion can also act viciously if he feels he's been wronged; such as confining Grand Maester Pycelle to the Black Cells for betraying him or, in his darkest hour, killing Shae for testifying against him during his trial and having an affair with his father, and then going on to kill Tywin himself. Because his father and sister treated him like a social leper, Tyrion craves love and acceptance and is genuinely hurt when this is denied him by others.

Tyrion has complex relationships with other members of his family, most of whom resent him and only thinly veil their contempt for his existence. His older sister Cersei blames him for causing the death of their mother and has, as revealed during a conversation with Oberyn, hated Tyrion since his birth. His father, Tywin shares Cersei's resentment for Tyrion; due to the death of his wife while birthing him, as Joanna was the only person Tywin ever loved. Although Tywin recognizes and respects Tyrion's intellect, it does not lessen his prejudice towards his youngest son; by the same token Tyrion fears and admires his father; but hates him for his inflexibility and unwillingness to show any love for any of his children. Tywin also just thinks it is an embarrassment that; Tyrion was born; with a physical disability, seeing it as a judgement from the gods meant to humiliate him; by his son's mere existence.

Only Tyrion's older brother, Jaime maintained a good relationship; with Tyrion, admiring him for both his intellect and inability to let his diminished stature drag him down and he has frequently attempted to come to Tyrion's defense; when his other family members treat him maliciously; making Jaime the only member of his immediate family; who Tyrion loves. Tyrion harbors a mutual admiration for Jaime, even naming him as his champion when he demanded a trial by combat while being held prisoner at the Eyrie. But this cozy relationship had ended; when Tyrion had killed their father, although they have reconciled; since then. The last time they were together, Tyrion tearfully thanked his brother for being the only Lannister to treat him like a brother, not a monster and that; Jaime had helped Tyrion survived his childhood.

Despite Tyrion's poor and mutually hateful relationship; with his sister, Cersei, he was noted to have had a very good relationship; with at least two of her children, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] and [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]]. This is seen where Mrycella showcased active care, affection, love and worry for Tyrion and; when he had returned safely back to King's landing, she; made sure to happily state that; she was glad he had survived alongside Tommen. Tyrion himself reciprocates her affection and love and; despite his relationship; with their mother, he truly cared for them. As seen where Tyrion was enraged upon learning of Mrycella's death and angerly argued; with [[Ellaria Sand]]; due to her hand in her death.

After Tyrion had killed Shae and his father, he becomes a broken man; Tyrion had lost the will to live. Traumatized; by killing the woman he had loved and losing his lordship, influence and fabulous wealth, he becomes more cynical and pessimistic, and was content to just drink himself to death instead of helping Varys to aid Daenerys Targaryen in getting the Iron Throne. Tyrion becomes convinced in the futility of everything, gaining a negative and fatalistic outlook on the past, and the future; to the point of suicidal, as well gains a lower view for matters he dealt with high esteem and importance beforehand in the past; such as the Great Houses or the bid for the Iron Throne. Even; when meeting Daenerys face to face, Tyrion had explained thatl he was still content to die. But whilst helping; with the chaos in Meereen and keeping Daenerys from becoming like her father in her ruthlessness, he regains his will to live. He also finally finds something to believe in, as he believes in Daenerys. His sense of humor is more muted and cynical than; before; but this may be the result of his no longer being able to rely on his family title for protection and influence, and having to earn his merits with Daenerys on his brains alone.

Although Tyrion's skills; with political maneuvering, administration and diplomacy are extremely impressive, his record as a military strategist and tactician are more mixed. In this respect, he is similar to his father, although unlike Tywin, Tyrion's lack of skill on the battlefield has more to do with his unwillingness to inflict heavy loss of life on either side. He achieved a successful ambush at the Battle of the Blackwater; with his wildfire trap and led his troops personally on a sortie; but this alone was still not enough to win the battle; without help from Tywin and the Tyrells; indeed, the massive casualties; resulting from the wildfire shook him and (presumably); made him reluctant to use; such a devastating weapon again. This in turn; made him somewhat overly cautious in his strategy to help Daenerys win against Cersei. As a result, most of his battle plans; with the exception of capturing Casterly Rock, failed, leading Daenerys to lose her patience; with his strategy and take matters; into her [[Battle of the Goldroad|own hands]]. Despite this, Tyrion had played a valuable role in developing and solidifying the alliance between Daenerys and Jon Snow, the King in the North.

Tyrion is somewhat of a pacifist in his heart. This is evident, when he several times advised Daenerys not to resort to violence; in order to solve problems, though this was also an attempt to; make sure that; she doesn't become like her father. He always desires a less violent approach to matters, only resorting to it; when there is no other way.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[George Appleby]] was a stunt double for [[Peter Dinklage]] in the role of Tyrion Lannister.

==In the books==
[[File:Roman Papsuev - Tyrion Lannister.png|thumb|300px|right|Tyrion Lannister by Roman "Amok" Papsuev.©]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tyrion is in his mid-twenties when the events of the series begin, whereas in the show his age is not mentioned. However, the age gap between him and his siblings is smaller: in the books, Tyrion was born when Cersei and Jaime were 7, while in the show, they were 4. This was likely to accommodate the actors: Peter Dinklage is four years ''older'' than Lena Headey and one year older than Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.

As well as being a dwarf, Tyrion is misshapen and often described as ugly and having eyes of [[wikipedia:heterochromia|two different colors]], one green and one black. He is described as having a huge disproportionate head and an pronounced ungainly waddle when he walks. His hair is lank and very pale, but when he lets his beard grow in it comes in as a mixture of blonde and black hairs. In the beginning of the TV series, actor Peter Dinklage insisted on not having a beard, because he felt that bearded dwarfs are a fantasy stereotype, though he agreed to grow a beard from the fifth season onwards.

Cersei hated Tyrion ever he was born, unjustly blaming him (like their father) of their mother's death, and also due to [[Maggy]]'s prophecy about the "valonqar"; she hurt him on several occasions. Jaime, on the other hand, always treated Tyrion kindly (in an argument between them in ''A Clash of Kings'', Cersei outright states the only reason she has never tried to have Tyrion killed is because Jaime would never forgive her for it).

Ever since he was a child, Tyrion has been interested in dragons. He used to dream of riding a dragon, imagining he was some lost Targaryen princeling, or a Valyrian dragonlord. He once asked his uncles Gerion and Tygett for one as a nameday present, and was devastated to hear that the last dragon had died a century ago. He eagerly reads any accounts he can find about dragons, though most of those are idle tales. On the way to Volantis, the sellsword [[Jon Connington|Griff]] orders Tyrion to set down all he knows of dragonlore; the task is formidable, but Tyrion labors at it diligently. The thought about meeting Daenerys and her dragons makes Tyrion relive his childhood dreams.

Tysha was reported to be the daughter of a crofter rather than a wheelwright (this may have been for the benefit of North American audiences who are less likely to know what a crofter is) and the marriage took place when he was only 13 years old. He bought them a little cottage where they lived as man and wife for their two week marriage, before his father had it annulled. Tywin not only had 50 guards rape her, but then ordered Tyrion to have sex with her as well, giving her a gold piece as a Lannister is worth more.

At the battle on the Green Fork, Tyrion is not knocked out by his own men. In fact he leads with distinction, holding the line under great adversity. Later when he tells his father that the plan to kill him by putting him in the vanguard (under the command of Ser Gregor Clegane) failed, Tyrion learns that his father had put him there hoping that an inexperienced Tyrion with undisciplined hill tribesmen would break and run to be pursued into a trap by the Stark forces. Tyrion holding the line had ruined the plan. It is a combination of this along with his reading of the situation they face in the war, and the fact that Jaime may not be retrievable, that makes Tywin decide to make use of Tyrion as acting Hand. Tyrion realizes that Tywin is preparing for the worst, that the Starks might well kill Jaime as revenge for Eddard's murder, so he is finally giving Tyrion real power.

When Tyrion relieves Janos Slynt of command of the Gold cloaks, it is Ser Jacelyn Bywater or "Ironhand" who becomes their new commander, not Bronn. It is Varys, not Tyrion, who comes up with the suggestion to send Joffrey some prostitutes to soften his temper, but the results are not shown. Tyrion does not send Littlefinger to Catelyn at Renly's camp with Lord Eddard's bones and an offer for the release of Jaime (though Baelish is sent to treat with the Tyrells after Renly's death). The bones are sent with Cleos Frey (replaced by [[Alton Lannister]] in the series) to Riverrun along with unacceptable peace terms and a force of 100 Lannister soldiers, that hide four men Tyrion has sent to break Jaime out, an escape attempt that fails.

Shae is not brought to the Tower of the Hand; instead she is put in a manse that Tyrion can approach by using a secret tunnel from a brothel. In the aftermath of [[Riots in King's Landing|the riots in King's Landing]] and as Stannis's troops advance on the city, Tyrion arranges Shae to become [[Lollys Stokeworth]]'s servant to have an excuse to bring her into the Red Keep, both for her protection and to keep her close.

The most important of the defenses for the city that Tyrion builds is a huge chain that stretches across the whole of Blackwater Rush, to be raised after Stannis's fleet enters to trap them inside with the wildfire.

In the book's version of the Battle of Blackwater, Tyrion has almost his entire nose cut off by Ser Mandon Moore's sword swipe; the TV series only included the deep scar across his face (which as also present in the books). As Peter Dinklage explained, "I know, for fans of the books, that Tyrion loses his nose in the battle. But it would be next to impossible and very expensive to do that on television, and I would be wearing a green sock [on my nose, to digitally remove it with greenscreen], I think, for the next however many years, which I don't know how that would be on set. But yeah, the digital artist would have a lot of work on their hands. So I think we came up with a really good solution."<ref>[http://wicnet.tumblr.com/post/46675084287/peter-dinklage-explains-why-tyrion-gets-to-keep Peter Dinklage Season 3 premiere Red Carpet interview]</ref>

In the official blooper reel for Season 4, when "action" is shouted and a stage hand closes the [[Wikipedia:Clapperboard|clapperboard]] right in front of Dinklage's face, he started jokingly pretending that board was held too close and cut his nose off.<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-7Fs9HJvs0 Season 4 bloopers from SDCC], about 17 seconds into the clip.</ref>

In ''A Storm of Swords'', when Joffrey is poisoned, Cersei is quick to blame Tyrion and have him put on a farcical show trial, which leads him to demand a trial by combat. As this occurs around the same time Jaime returns to the capital, Tyrion confers with his uncle Kevan while in custody, and it is Kevan who persuades Tywin to spare Tyrion and send him to the Night's Watch. After Oberyn Martell is killed and Tyrion is sentenced to death, he is freed by Jaime, who goes on to reveal that his marriage to Tysha was actually a proper marriage and he had been forced by Tywin to make it look like it had been staged. Enraged at such a betrayal, Tyrion vows revenge on Jaime, Cersei and Tywin, spitefully but falsely telling Jaime that he killed Joffrey, and it is for this reason that he confronts and kills Shae and then Tywin while he is on the privy (in the television series, he kills Tywin for Shae, which left some fans confused as to why Tyrion would kill his own father for a woman who committed the ultimate betrayal against him and who he himself had just killed). His story ends just after he kills Tywin, and unlike the end of the fourth season, it is left unrevealed if he escaped Westeros or not.

Tyrion does not appear in the fourth book, ''A Feast for Crows'', and his whereabouts are not revealed, though he is mentioned several times, particularly due to Cersei having placed a bounty on his head, and also Cersei's increasing paranoia that Tyrion is still hiding somewhere in the Red Keep, waiting for the right moment to strike and kill her. Tyrion's escape also fuels Cersei's paranoia of House Tyrell: a Tyrell coin is found in the cell of an undergaoler named Rugen (who is actually Varys in disguise), leading Cersei to believe that the Tyrells, particularly Margaery, might have conspired with Tyrion to murder Joffrey and helped him escape by bribing the guards, maybe even conspired to kill Tywin too.

Several innocent dwarfs are killed by bounty hunters who mistake them for Tyrion. Among them are: a pious dwarf that Brienne meets at the Riverlands; a Tyroshi juggler; Oppo (aka Groat), one of the two dwarfs who performed at Joffrey's wedding. Cersei publicly refuses to punish anyone who kills an innocent dwarf (although one bounty hunter's blatant attempts to pass off a head that clearly isn't Tyrion offends Cersei so much she hands him over to [[Qyburn]] for his experiments)

In ''A Dance with Dragons'', it is finally revealed that Tyrion has successfully fled Westeros with help from Varys, who stays in King's Landing but arranges for [[Illyrio Mopatis]] to shelter him in Pentos. While in Illyrio's mansion, Tyrion is persuaded by Illyrio to travel to Meereen with some companions to aid Daenerys Targaryen in reclaiming the Iron Throne, and in the process to take his revenge on both Cersei and Jaime (though he expresses a desire to rape and kill Cersei, he begins to have second thoughts about Jaime near the end of the book).

Tyrion soon joins Illyrio's friends - a sellsword named Griff, his son and their servants (all of whom have been omitted from the TV show). Soon he learns to know that Griff and his son are in fact the presumed-dead [[Jon Connington]] and [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|Aegon Targaryen]], the son of Rhaegar and Elia. Connington treats Tyrion hostilely, but Aegon befriends him. 

Aegon tells Tyrion that he will soon meet and marry Daenerys, she will give him her troops and dragons, and together they will sail to Westeros and conquer it. Tyrion pours cold water on the overconfident youth's hopes, pointing out his aunt is not some timid little girl who does whatever she is told, but a powerful queen, who has crossed deserts, survived assassins, rallied armies and conquered cities, who is unlikely to welcome a boy claiming to have a better claim to the Iron Throne than her own. Tyrion concludes that if Aegon appears before her like that (even with the Golden Company), he'll look like a beggar; he advises Aegon to travel to Westeros instead, raise his banners, rally supporters and take advantage of the chaos left by the [[War of the Five Kings]], and then Daenerys will come and meet him as equals. Aegon accepts Tyrion's advice.

During the journey, they pass Volantis and are attacked by Stone Men. Tyrion falls into the water, but is rescued by Connington, who (not Jorah Mormont) gets infected with greyscale in the process.

While in a brothel (not in Volantis itself, but one of its outlying towns), Tyrion is captured by Jorah Mormont, who intends to take him to Daenerys. They also meet Penny, one of the dwarfs who performed at Joffrey's wedding and whose brother Oppo has recently been killed by dwarf hunters seeking Tyrion; she initially blames Tyrion for Oppo's death and attempts to kill him, but eventually realizes it was not his fault. They board a ship whose destination is Qarth. One of the passengers is Moqorro, a red priest who was sent by the High Priest of Volantis, to offer Daenerys guidance and help. Moqorro tells Tyrion he has seen him in a vision as "''a small man with a big shadow''." Tyrion is flattered to hear that, but is also skeptical.

The ship is badly damaged in a storm. After floating for days, the passengers are captured by slave traders. Tyrion and Penny  are sold to Yezzan zo Qaggaz (who is vastly different from his series counterpart) in his tent in the siege camp outside Meereen; Tyrion saves Jorah from being sold for the fighting pits by persuading the mean overseer of Yezzan's slaves to buy him too, claiming that Jorah participates the show which Tyrion and Penny play. Soon Tyrion impresses Yezzan by through his skill at Cyvasse, a popular board game.

Tyrion and Penny are made to perform in Daznak's Pit, during which Tyrion sees Daenerys from afar and very nearly calls out to her, but stops himself after noticing Barristan Selmy beside her, who may prejudice her against him due to their shared hatred for the Lannisters. The slave masters intend to unleash a pack of lions into the pit, but Daenerys puts a stop to the act, unknowingly saving Tyrion's life. 

The "bloody flux" plague decimates the siege; Yezzan is among its victims. Tyrion seizes the opportunity to escape with Jorah and Penny to the camp of the Second Sons, who have recently betrayed Daenerys to side with the armies of Yunkai. Tyrion and Jorah join the sellsword company, intending to persuade them to change their allegiance back to Daenerys in exchange for the wealth of Casterly Rock, his birthright since Jaime has renounced it. Meanwhile, back in King's Landing, Varys shoots Kevan Lannister with a crossbow to fool Cersei into thinking Tyrion is still in the capital.

Tyrion is set to return in ''The Winds of Winter''. A released sample chapter reveals that he and Jorah successfully persuade  the Second Sons to rejoin Daenerys and fight for her, while the battle against the Yunkish is going on. Author George R. R. Martin has also confirmed that Tyrion and Daenerys will meet face to face in the book.

As much as Tyrion loathed Joffrey, he wouldn't harm him due to the taboo of kinslaying. After he is told the truth about Tysha, it seems Tyrion does not care anymore about that taboo: he kills his father, and in the fifth novel he brags about the kinslayings he has performed, the actual (his father) and the alleged (Joffrey) alike; he even takes the "credit" for his mother's death, and also states he intends to kill his siblings.

Tyrion and Jaime have always been on good terms. When Tyrion was small, Jaime brought him toys, barrel hoops, blocks and a carved wooden lion. He gave Tyrion his first pony and taught him how to ride. Tyrion vividly recalls all that in the fifth novel, when he thinks about Tysha; he is filled with bitterness at the thought that he was betrayed by his brother, his own blood, whom he never doubted. Yet, by the end of the novel, Jaime is the first name that comes to his mind when he is asked "what do you miss?"; perhaps Tyrion begins to have second thoughts about Jaime, although he has not forgiven him yet.

According to the TV series official [[pronunciation guide]] developed for the cast and crew, "Tyrion Lannister" is pronounced "TEER-ee-un LAN-iss-ter."
