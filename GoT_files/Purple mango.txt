A '''purple mango'''<ref name="Dedalvs">[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref> with crawling vines was native to the [[Valyrian peninsula]]. It is said to have been so dense and nourishing that it could fuel a soldier on long journeys.

==Uses==
The fruit was only available to nobles, as it was believed that only those who were "pure of heart" could eat it; to others it was [[poison]]ous. As such, it was invoked as judgment in formal trials and familial disputes alike, and those who fell ill after ingesting it were proven false. The mother of [[Jaehaelor Mataeryon]] died after eating it, with painful gut cramps and bloody stool. [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Mikkellion]] likened its effects to the [[tears of Lys]].<ref name="Dedalvs" />

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels and their supplementary material, there is no mention of this fruit.
