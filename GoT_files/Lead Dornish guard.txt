==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
[[File:dead-leaddornishguard-s5e4.jpg|thumb|The guard after being stabbed in the throat by Bronn's knife.]]
While riding along the Dornish coastline, the Dornish guard and his men discover [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Bronn]]. Judging his accent, he assumes that Bronn is from [[King's Landing]] and asks them why they are so far from home. Bronn and Jaime try to convince the guard that their ship capsized in the night and they simply wish to return home. He does not believe them and orders them to disarm. The two comply, but Bronn swiftly throws his knife at the guard's throat, killing him.{{Ref|GOT504}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no parallel character, nor parallel fight scene. 

Jaime and Bronn do not travel to Dorne at all; instead, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] sends Ser [[Balon Swann]], who goes to Dorne on an official mission to take [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] back (and also to play his part in Cersei's scheme to assassinate [[Trystane Martell]]), so he does not need to smuggle himself into the country. Ser Balon does not have any similar violent encounter; on the contrary, he is amiably welcomed at [[Sunspear]] by [[Doran Martell]], even though the latter is aware of Cersei's vile intentions.
