'''House Brune'''{{Ref|GOT201}}{{Note|Lothor's surname is Brune.}} of [[Brownhollow]] is a vassal house from the [[Crownlands]] that directly holds fealty to the elected monarchs of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]].

==Members==
*[[Lothor Brune]], a freerider in service to [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Brune is a poor but old family from [[Crackclaw Point]], a backwater of the [[Crownlands]] whose lords descend primarily from the [[First Men]]. House Brune of the [[Dyre Den]] is the main branch of the family, though a [[cadet branch]] known as House Brune of Brownhollow also exists at the time of the novels, also located on Crackclaw Point, though they are only [[Knighthood#Types of knights|landed knights]], not noble lords. Their sigil is a brown bear claw on a white background, with a double brown line running around the edge.

Lothor Brune is a distant minor relative of House Brune of Brownhollow - itself a poor cadet branch of landed knights stemming from an already poor main family of minor nobles. It is therefore unsurprising that Lothor grew up poor and fighting for a living, explaining why he is a freerider serving another lord at the beginning of the story. After his father's death, Lothor tried to find a place with House Brune of Brownhollow, but they said he was no close kin of theirs and turned him away. Eventually, he entered the service of Petyr Baelish.

After the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], Lothor Brune is promised a keep in the [[riverlands]] at war's end. This would make him the founder of his own cadet branch of House Brune.
