In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ygg's story is the same. Legend states that the Grey King carved his first longship from Ygg's hard pale wood. It is unknown if Ygg was a [[weirwood]], as the [[First Men]] were known to hang the entrails of the condemned in the branches of heart trees.
