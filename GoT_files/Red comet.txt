The '''red comet'''{{Ref|GOT201}} is an astronomical phenomenon. It appeared in the skies over both [[Westeros]] and [[Essos]] in [[299 AC]],{{Dateref|Game of Thrones: Season 2}} shortly after the outbreak of the [[War of the Five Kings]] and the hatching of the [[dragon]]s of [[Daenerys Targaryen]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
After touching the [[weirwood]] tree in the [[godswood]] of [[Harrenhal]], [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] has a vision of the red comet, among other things.{{Ref|HOTD208}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The red comet was seen in the skies over most of the two continents, bright enough to be seen during the day. Its significance is discussed by the people of [[Winterfell]], who seem divided on it being an omen of [[Robb Stark|Robb]]'s victory or if its red color indicates a triumph for the forces of [[House Lannister]]. Still others consider the red color to represent the blood of [[Eddard Stark]]. However, [[Osha]] dismisses all of these suggestions: she maintains that the comet signifies nothing more or less than the return of [[dragon]]s.{{Ref|GOT201}}

==In the books==
The red comet is first seen in the books by Jhogo, before [[Drogo]]'s funeral pyre. It is used as a symbol to light the pyre on fire, as it is believed the brighter the star, the fiercer a man burned in life.

In the books, the red comet is seen throughout the known world and interpreted in different manners by different people. Some see it as harbinger of their victory - or their enemies' victory - in the War of the Five Kings, or as an omen of vengeance, while to many more it signifies the onset of war and the bloodshed that is to come. The comet is also interpreted by [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] as a sign that she must venture into the [[Red Waste]]. [[Old Nan]] was the only character to interpret it as dragons. In the TV continuity, Old Nan is considered to have died between seasons 1 and 2 ([[Margaret John]] passed away before Season 1 had aired), so it is Osha who postulates that connection.

It also receives different names. In [[King's Landing]] it is referred to as "King [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s comet" at court and the "Red Messenger" in the streets. Soldiers in the [[Riverlands]] also call it the Red Messenger. The members of the [[Night's Watch]] that take part in the [[great ranging]] refer to it as "Mormont's Torch", while [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] calls it the "Red Sword" on account of its shape. The [[Dothraki]] of Daenerys's ''[[khalasar]]'' call it "shierak qiya," meaning "bleeding star."
