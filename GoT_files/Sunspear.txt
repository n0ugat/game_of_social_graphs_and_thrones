'''Sunspear'''{{Ref|GOT401}} is the capital of [[Dorne]], southernmost of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], located in the far southeast of the continent on the [[Summer Sea]]. It consists of a strong, fortified castle and a town that sprawls around it. It is a town built largely of mud and straw. The town's largest structure is [[Spear Tower]], a 150-feet structure with a pinnacle of shining steel.

The castle was the seat of [[House Martell]], Princes of Dorne, until the family was temporarily deposed by [[Ellaria Sand]] and the three eldest [[Sand Snakes]], who seized power through a [[Coup in Dorne|coup]]. With the latter dead and the former imprisoned for life in [[King's Landing]] following a [[Assault on the Targaryen fleet|naval assault]] before being most likely killed during the [[Battle of King's Landing]], a new [[Prince of Dorne (Last War)|Prince of Dorne]] assumed rule in Dorne, and by extension Sunspear.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Sunspear is the principal stronghold of House Martell. It is located on the far-eastern coast of Dorne and consists of two strong towers, the Spear Tower and the Tower of the Sun, the latter of which contains the Prince of Dorne's throne room. The castle walls are sand-colored, setting it apart from the other major castles of [[Westeros]].

Sunspear is surrounded by the shadow town, which consists of shops, markets and bazaars. The town is also walled, though more buildings - mostly mud-brick hovels - stretch beyond it. The castle and town also have a modest harbor. Areo Hotah, who is from the Free Cities, notes that the town around Sunspear isn't really large enough to be considered a true "city" on the scale of Norvos, Pentos, or King's Landing, but it is still the largest settlement in Dorne.
