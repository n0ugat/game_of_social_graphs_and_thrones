In November 2022, Gough commented on ''Bloodmoon'' to The Hollywood Reporter: "''It was wonderful, without a doubt; I was able to work alongside some incredible people. In the end, though, things did not go well. And the point is that this kind of thing happens all the time. Perhaps people think that, this being Game of Thrones, the news of its cancellation is devastating. For me, everything happens for a reason and everything happens the way it's supposed to. When our pilot episode wasn’t chosen, when the production didn’t go forward, I didn't feel devastated. Because, obviously, it wasn't destined to happen. So, I went back home, to the theater, and then I was contacted by, if possible, an even bigger franchise. I found a role that is closer to those I usually play. And the channel has gone on to produce another GOT series that, from what I've heard, did pretty well.''"<ref>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/andor-denise-gough-interview-tony-gilroy-game-of-thrones-1235266613/</ref>
