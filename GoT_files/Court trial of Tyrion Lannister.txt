{{Quote|I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had! Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores! I wish I was the monster you think I am! I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you! I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it!|[[Tyrion Lannister]].|The Laws of Gods and Men}}
The '''court trial of Tyrion Lannister''' was a major turning point during the [[War of the Five Kings]], in which [[Tyrion Lannister]] was tried for [[Purple Wedding|the assassination]] of King [[Joffrey Baratheon]] at his wedding feast.

It quickly becomes apparent that the spectacle is nothing more than a mere show trial. Tyrion observes that the presiding judge, [[Tywin Lannister|his father]], and his main accuser, [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]], have wanted him dead for longer than anyone and that another of the judges, [[Mace Tyrell]], will go along with whatever Tywin says.

All the witnesses against Tyrion are either his enemies or have otherwise been bribed or cajoled by his sister or father into testifying. Most give circumstantial, exaggerated, and sometimes outright false evidence, and Tyrion is not permitted to cross-examine them. It is also pretty apparent that Tyrion has no chance of acquittal.

Ultimately, Tyrion snaps at the injustice, insulting the entire court in the process. With his loyalty to his father (and to a lesser extent [[House Lannister]]) shattered, Tyrion decides to place his fate in the hands of the Seven, demanding a trial by combat, a decision that would have dire consequences.

==History==
=== Prelude ===
{{Quote|He did this! He poisoned my son, your King! Take him! TAKE HIM! TAKE HIM! TAKE HIM!|Cersei Lannister, ordering the arrest of Tyrion immediately after [[Purple Wedding|Joffrey's death]].|The Lion and the Rose}}With the [[War of the Five Kings]] now behind them and Lannister power its zenith, Tywin moved to strengthen the Lannister position and arranged the marriage of his grandson to the maiden of [[Highgarden]], [[Margaery Tyrell]]. Unknown to most, [[Olenna Tyrell]] was also concerned, but for very different reasons. Word had reached her about Joffrey's behaviour, and when she spoke to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] about it in confidence, she confirmed Olenna's worst fears.

At the [[Purple Wedding|ceremony]] itself, an extravagant banquet was held for all the guests, followed by a mocking play re-enacting the War of the Five Kings, with dwarf actors culminating in Joffrey's victory. Tyrion was far from satisfied by this and after he verbally insults Joffrey, was forced to serve as his nephew's cupbearer. Shortly after cutting the pie, Joffrey drank deeply from his goblet, then started choking. As he collapses, struggling to breathe,  [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and Cersei rush to his side, just as his face starts turning purple. With his last ounce of strength, Joffrey raises his hand towards Tyrion (whether in accusation or repentance is unknown, though the former seems more likely), before expiring in his mother's arms.

An enraged and grieving Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion of murdering her son and orders him to be arrested, to which the [[Kingsguard]] promptly obliges. In the confusion, Sansa is spirited away by [[Dontos Hollard]]. Joffrey is subsequently laid to rest in the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], and his younger brother [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] succeeds him as King.

Tyrion is subsequently charged with [[regicide]], and confined to the dungeons awaiting trial. Cersei starts preparing a strong case against her brother, confident that he is guilty of the crime and determine to seek justice for her murdered son. When questioned by Jaime, Tyrion declares he is innocent, and though he admits he hated Joffrey, the boy was still his family and so Tyrion would have never actually harmed him.

===Machinations===
Unknown to the majority of the court, it was Olenna who conspired with [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] to have Joffrey murdered. As noted by Tyrion before his court trial, however, even if this detail was known, Cersei and Tywin had been looking for an excuse to get rid of him for a long time by that point anyway, so it wouldn't have made any real difference.

===The trial===
====First part====
The court assembles, and Tyrion is brought forward in manacles. Tommen recuses himself and appoints [[Hand of the King]] Tywin to oversee the trial in his place. The other presiding judges are [[Mace Tyrell]] and [[Oberyn Martell]].<ref name="E36">"[[The Laws of Gods and Men]]"</ref>

Tywin asks Tyrion to admit if he killed Joffrey. Tyrion denies the charge, and also denies any knowledge of Sansa's involvement. When asked for his opinion on the cause of Joffrey's death, he blames the [[pigeon pie]].

One witness after another comes forward to give damning testimony, although all they manage to do is prove that Tyrion often disagreed and argued with Joffrey, while there is absolutely nothing in their testimonies to imply that Tyrion actually killed him. Some testimonies are even exaggerated and outright fabricated.

=====Ser Meryn Trant=====
[[File:Meryn.png|thumb]]
Ser [[Meryn Trant]] recounts the [[The Old Gods and the New|occasion]] when Tyrion slapped Joffrey and called him a "vicious idiot" (after Joffrey caused [[Riots in King's Landing|riots]]), and when he called Joffrey a "halfwit" and [[Garden of Bones (episode)|warned him]] about the fate of the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]], who also believed he could do whatever he wished, and even threatened to have Trant killed by [[Bronn]] when he spoke in Joffrey's defense. Trant, however, does not mention that at the time, he was beating and stripping Sansa in the throne room at Joffrey's behest. When Tyrion attempts to make this point, he is silenced by Tywin.

=====Pycelle=====
[[File:Pycelle 4x06.jpg|thumb]]
[[Pycelle]] claims Tyrion stole a large quantity of poisons from him after having him [[What Is Dead May Never Die|imprisoned]]. He confirms poisoning as the cause of Joffrey's death, specifically one known as "the [[strangler]]". He claims that Dontos Hollard's body was found with the necklace Sansa wore at the wedding, and that the necklace contained traces of the poison. He presents the necklace as evidence. Pycelle concludes that Tyrion and his wife conspired to "strike down the most noble child the Gods ever put on this good earth."

=====Cersei=====
[[File:Cersei-trial-800x450.jpg|thumb]]
Cersei tells the court of Tyrion's threat to her: "''I will hurt you for this. A day will come when you think you are safe and happy, and suddenly your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will know the debt is paid.''" Oberyn, clearly questioning the truth in Cersei's statement, asks her what debt Tyrion meant (an alternate way of asking Cersei how she hurt Tyrion in the first place), and Cersei responds that she discovered Tyrion was keeping whores in the [[Tower of the Hand]] and she asked him to stop, when in reality she spitefully had the Kingsguard beat up and imprison [[Ros]], whom she incorrectly believed to be Tyrion's lover.

She also speaks of Tyrion's plans to place Joffrey at risk near the fighting during the [[Battle of the Blackwater]], although she says Joffrey bravely insisted on being at the front to inspire his troops. In reality, Cersei ordered Joffrey to be removed from the front line, and the cowardly boy readily acquiesced, ironically leaving it to Tyrion himself to inspire the troops and defend the city against [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]].<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

=====Varys=====
[[File:Tyrion questions Varys.png|thumb|Tyrion questions Varys at his trial.]]
[[Varys]] recalls Tyrion's [[Mhysa|confrontation]] with Joffrey at the [[Small Council]] meeting about [[Red Wedding|the deaths of Robb and Catelyn Stark]], when he warned Joffrey to be wary around monsters because "just now kings are dying like flies." Varys suggests that Tyrion's marriage to Sansa may have made him more sympathetic to the [[North]].

Tyrion is permitted to ask one question. He reminds Varys of their conversation after the Battle of Blackwater. Varys told him that he had saved the city, and though it would go unrecorded in the history books, he would not forget him. Tyrion asks Varys if he has indeed forgotten. Varys sighs that "Sadly, I never forget a thing."<ref name="E36" />

====Recess====
At the recess, Jaime confronts Tywin, calling the trial a farce entirely manipulated by Cersei, and says that Tywin is about to condemn his own son to death. Tywin denies any involvement in manipulating the trial in Cersei's favour but is blasted by Jaime, who claims that even if Tyrion did kill Joffrey, he himself did the same to the Mad King, which ironically saved Tywin's life. Jaime brokers a deal with his father: if Tywin agrees to let Tyrion live, Jaime will renounce his Kingsguard vows, reclaim his place as Tywin's heir, take up his seat at [[Casterly Rock]], marry a suitable wife, and have children, all to continue Tywin's legacy as Tywin had initially intended. Tywin immediately accepts and once again accepts Jaime as his son, but on the condition that Tyrion plead for mercy once 'proven' guilty, upon which Tywin will allow Tyrion to leave King's Landing and join the [[Night's Watch]].

Jaime speaks with Tyrion just before the trial resumes and informs him of their father's offer. Tyrion is understandably not convinced, reminding Jaime that [[Eddard Stark]] was offered the same deal and was [[Execution of Eddard Stark|executed]] nevertheless, but Jaime promises that Tywin will not commit such a treasonous act like Joffrey did. He pleads with Tyrion just to stay calm and refrain from getting angry again in order for the deal to stand. As he leaves Tyrion does appear to consider this option.<ref name="E36" />

====Second part====
=====Shae=====
[[File:MV5BMTYzNTI2MzYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE2OTg3MTE@_V1_SX1303_SY552_.jpg|thumb]]
Cersei's final witness comes forward. To Tyrion's horror, it is [[Shae]]. In front of the entire court, Shae lies that Tyrion and Sansa plotted together to murder Joffrey with poison stolen from Pycelle. Tyrion complied because he was madly in love with Sansa, but she refused to let him consummate their marriage.

Once again, Oberyn debates the veracity of the testimony and questions as to why Tyrion would tell Shae such things if he really meant to kill Joffrey. After brief consideration, Shae reveals that she was Tyrion's personal whore, lying that Tyrion kidnapped her from a more handsome knight and forced her to become his sex slave, also giving intimate details on their relationship. All but heartbroken, Tyrion quietly asks Shae to stop, but she coldly responds, "I am a whore, remember?", repeating the same words he said to her while trying to get her to leave King's Landing (which was, ironically, for her own safety).

As Shae's testimony ends, the court appears utterly convinced that Tyrion is a bad character who is guilty of the crime he is accused of. Cersei shoots a savage smile at Tyrion, whilst Tywin looks on dismissively. Shae herself is humiliated and cannot bring herself to look at Tyrion.

=====Tyrion's outburst=====
What nobody realizes, however, is that they have just overstepped the mark. Tyrion's grief has been replaced by seething, white-hot fury. He is incandescent with rage that his own family is trying to condemn him for a crime that he did not commit and that they were prepared to manipulate the woman he loves into testifying against him in such a humiliating [[File:Tyrion 4x07.jpg|thumb|"''I demand a trial by combat!''"]]manner. This, coupled with the lack of gratitude he received following the events at Blackwater Bay and the fact that the realm would betray him for a King that they all hated and despised, proves to be too much.

After enduring a lifetime of cruelty, abuse and verbal ridicule, Tyrion finally reaches his breaking point. He silences the court under the pretext of offering a confession. When Tywin tries to clarify this, however, Tyrion turns to face the witnesses and attendants. He reminds everybody present -- the Lords, Ladies, Maesters and other high-born citizens -- that it was ''he'' who saved them from Stannis at the Battle of Blackwater Bay (not Tywin or the Tyrells, and certainly not Joffrey). He openly expresses his regret for saving such an ungrateful citizenry and growls venomously, "''I should have let Stannis kill you all!''", thus indicating the severance of his allegiance to House Lannister, whilst also further alienating himself from the court.

Tywin has to shout over the enraged audience in order to try and obtain Tyrion's confession. When the room falls silent again Tyrion is questioned, but instead of confessing - he denies any involvement in Joffrey's murder and pleads guilty to being a dwarf, stating mockingly that the trial is merely another way for his father and sister to try and get rid of him. Tywin brushes this aside (indicating it is true), and tries to stick to the matter at hand. He asks earnestly if Tyrion has anything to say in his defense, to which Tyrion once again professes his innocence, though fully aware that by this point nobody will believe him.

Tyrion then directs his fury towards Cersei, shouting directly to his sister's face; "''I did not kill Joffrey, but I wish that I had! Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than a thousand lying whores!''"

As his sister looks on angrily, and Shae is hurt, Tyrion turns back to the court. He expresses his regret that he is not that person, declaring that if he was, he would then be free of conscience and willing to die in order to exact retribution by poisoning the "whole pack of you" for treating him like this. The court explodes at this, and Tywin desperately tries to restore order, ordering Meryn Trent to have Tyrion removed before he can stir up any more trouble.

Sick of his father's manipulation, however, Tyrion does not give Meryn that chance. Before anyone can react, Tyrion shouts that he will not allow himself to be executed for the sake of Joffrey, and states that he knows he will not be served true justice at such a farcical show-trial. Well aware that he now has nothing to lose, Tyrion declares that he will leave his fate in the hands of the Gods.

Tyrion puts an end to the all of the legal proceedings and demands a [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]].<ref name="E36" />

As the court bursts into an angry protest, the reactions of several main characters are shown in sequence:

*Margaery (the only person in the courtroom that knows the truth) is stunned by this development, and alongside her ignorant brother [[Loras Tyrell|Loras]], they look up at the judges.
*A worried looking Shae glances up at the judges then looks away nervously (though whether she is concerned about herself or Tyrion remains unclear).
*Oberyn leans forward, looking genuinely interested at this turn of events.
*In contrast, Jaime sighs sadly, thinking that any hope of saving Tyrion is lost.
*Cersei manages to keep her emotions in check but clenches her fingers together angrily, enraged that the man she perceives as Joffrey's killer has successfully outmaneuvered her.
*As for Tyrion, he locks eyes with Tywin, who is glaring down at him. Tyrion smirks triumphantly up at his father, knowing full well that he has just turned his father's manipulation on its head.

=== Aftermath ===
The trial would have serious consequences for the entirety of Westeros and Essos. These effects were both far-reaching and long-lasting. In the short term, two of the presiding judges soon lost their lives. In the long term, great suffering was wrought upon the innocent civilians of Westeros, two of the Great Houses became extinct, and many of the people in attendance lost their lives.

The verdict itself is rendered shortly afterwards in [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion's second trial by combat]] when the [[Gregor Clegane|Mountain]] (acting on as Cersei's champion), despite suffering serious injuries, bests and kills Tyrion's champion, Oberyn Martell, who volunteered in order to avenge the deaths of [[Elia Martell|Elia]] and her children (who were all murdered by the Mountain). With the battle over, Tywin immediately sentences Tyrion to death, much to Cersei's delight.

Oberyn's death further widens the rift between the Lannisters and [[Dorne]], which has ultimately never been repaired. Whilst [[Doran Martell]] works to ensure peace with the Lannisters this was not what his people wanted, and following the coup by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes (which saw the extinction of House Martell), Dorne openly rebelled against the Iron Throne. 

Unwilling to let his brother die, Jaime secretly rescues Tyrion the night before his execution, and arranges for his safe transportation out of King's Landing. However, an emotionally distraught Tyrion [[Assassinations in the Tower of the Hand|murders his father and Shae]].

Back in Westeros, Tywin's death brings an end to his stabilizing influence, plunging the Kingdom and House Lannister into total disarray.

=== The truth revealed ===

At the conclusion of the [[Sack of Highgarden]], Jaime confronted Olenna. After ingesting the poison that Jaime provided, which would save her from any of the crueler fates Cersei had suggested, Olenna calmly confessed to him that she was the one that murdered Joffrey. With her final words, the last Tyrell asked the stunned Jaime to relay this information to Cersei, so she could spite the vile Queen one last time.

Jaime ultimately honoured Olenna's last request. Following the disastrous [[Battle of the Goldroad]], he met with Cersei. When his sister brought up Tyrion, Jaime informed her of Olenna's confession. Initially, Cersei did not believe Jaime, but he managed to persuade her. Refusing to acknowledge that she had been wrong all along, Cersei was furious that Olenna managed to cheat her one final time and, as Tyrion had predicted, continued to blame her younger brother for the decline of House Lannister's prosperity.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Tyrion's trial is longer, spanning over four days. There are also a much larger number of witnesses brought forward by the crown. Although some of them consider Tyrion to be innocent, they nevertheless lend credence to Cersei's case. Others, however, seeking Cersei's favour, tell either half-truths or outright lies. One witness, Taena Merryweather, even goes so far as to say she saw Tyrion put something in Joffrey's cup. Cersei herself does not testify, only bringing the forth witnesses.

Nobody tries to bribe [[Podrick Payne|Pod]] into giving testimony against Tyrion either. [[Bronn]] is also not investigated for any aspect of Joffrey's murder. Like in the show, Tyrion asks Bronn to be his champion but Bronn is now set to marry [[Lollys Stokeworth]] and is now being paid well by the Queen. Although he does like Tyrion, Bronn is not going to risk his life for him. Tyrion is not offended by this and the pair part as friends.{{Bookref|ASOS|66}}

In contrast to the show, Jaime does not visit Tyrion at any point during the proceedings. In fact, Tyrion is not even aware that his brother is present in the city, since he and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] arrived ''following'' Joffrey's death. Jaime does attend the trial, but stands at the back of the hall, where Tyrion either does not see or recognize him. This is no surprise, since half the court no longer seems to recognize Jaime.{{Bookref|ASOS|67}} 

Instead, it is [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]] who visits him in prison. He is the one who tells Tyrion that Tywin, [[Mace Tyrell]] and [[Oberyn Martell]] will stand in judgment of him. When Tyrion claims he may demand [[trial by combat|a trial by combat]], his uncle replies that Cersei will name the Mountain as her champion. Tyrion thinks how his sister checks his moves before he makes them. Kevan asks Tyrion if he has any witnesses, and promises to do all in his power to produce them. Before Kevan leaves, Tyrion says "I did not do this". Kevan answers "I wish I could believe that". Tyrion wonders if [[Sansa Stark|his wife]] is the murderer. The next day, Kevan frowns to see that Tyrion's witness list has only one name - Sansa. He tells Tyrion that there is a large reward on her head, and [[Addam Marbrand]] looks for her.

The trial begins with a prayer from the High Septon, who asks the Father Above to guide them to justice. Tywin asks: "Tyrion, did you kill King Joffrey?" Tyrion denies. Mace Tyrell demands if it was Sansa. Tyrion thinks ''"I would have, if I'd been her"'' but answers "The gods killed Joffrey. He choked on his pigeon pie". Tywin declares that first the witnesses against Tyrion will be heard, then he may present his own witnesses, and he may speak only with permission.

The witnesses who testify against Tyrion are:
*Ser [[Balon Swann]]. Unlike the rest of the witnesses, his testimony is wholly true, rather objective and in favor of Tyrion. He praises Tyrion's bravery at [[Battle of the Blackwater]], and claims he does not believe Tyrion murdered Joffrey. He admits that Tyrion struck Joffrey after the [[riots in King's Landing]], but claims it was only a fit of wrath.
*Ser [[Meryn Trant]] expands on Ser Balon's account, claiming that following the riot Tyrion knocked Joffrey to the ground and began kicking him, and shouted that it was unjust that Joffrey had escaped unharmed from the mobs - which is true. Only then Tyrion begins to grasp his sister's plan: she began with a man known to be honest, and milked him for all he would give. Every witness to follow will tell a worse tale. Ser Meryn goes on to tell how Tyrion had stopped Joffrey’s chastisement of Sansa, claiming that Tyrion asked Joffrey if he knew what had happened to [[Aerys II Targaryen]], and when Ser Boros spoke up in defense of the king, Tyrion threatened to have him killed. That part of Meryn's testimony is also true, but he "forgets" to mention what made Tyrion act that way - Joffrey's unprovoked cruelty toward Sansa.
*Ser [[Boros Blount]] comes next, repeating Ser Meryn's story. Whether or not he holds a grudge toward Cersei for dismissing him from the Kingsguard, he says the words she wants all the same.
*Osney and Osfryd Kettleblack tell of Tyrion's supper with Cersei before the Battle of the Blackwater, and of the threats he’d made - that he would wait for a day when she was happy, and make her joy turn to ashes in her mouth. They speak true, but "forget" to mention what made Tyrion issue those threats - the abduction and vicious beating of Alayaya (in the show she was replaced with [[Ros]]), whom Cersei mistook for [[Shae|Tyrion's mistress]].
*Ser Osmund Kettleblack of the [[Kingsguard]] swears that Joffrey had long known that Tyrion meant to murder him. "It was the day they gave me the white cloak, my lords. That brave boy said to me, 'Good Ser Osmund, guard me well, for my uncle loves me not. He means to be king in my place'." Tyrion is so angry to hear those lies that he loses his temper and yells "Liar!" at Ser Osmund. Tywin warns Tyrion that he will be chained hand and foot. Tyrion is forced to apologize.{{Bookref|ASOS|66}}

===Second day of the trial===
*Maesters Ballabar and Frenken testify that they had opened Joffrey's corpse, and found no morsel of pigeon pie nor any other food lodged in his throat. They claim it was poison that killed him - which is true.
*[[Pycelle]] tells about the various poisons he has in store, and that Tyrion stole them from his chambers, when he had Pycelle imprisoned - which is true. He claims the poison that killed Joffrey was the Strangler, but this rare poison was not found, because Tyrion used it all to kill "the noblest child the gods ever put on this good earth". Pycelle does not mention [[Dontos Hollard]]'s body, since it was burnt at [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]]'s command without leaving a trace.

After Pycelle comes many Lords and ladies and noble knights, highborn and humble alike, all have been present at the wedding feast, have all seen Joffrey choke, his face turning as black as a Dornish plum:
*Lord Redwyne, Lord Celtigar, and Ser Flement Brax testify that they had heard Tyrion threaten Joffrey.
*Two serving men, a juggler, Lord Gyles, Ser Hobber Redwyne and Ser Philip Foote testify they observed Tyrion fill the wedding chalice - which is true: unlike in show, Tyrion refilled the chalice twice at Joffrey's command.
*Lady Taena Merryweather swears that she had seen Tyrion drop something into the king's wine while Joff and Margaery were cutting the pie.
*Old Estermont, young Peckledon, the singer Galyeon of Cuy, and the squires Morros and Jothos Slynt tell how Tyrion had picked up the chalice as Joffrey was dying and poured out the last of the poisoned wine onto the floor - which is true.

Watching the endless line of witnesses, Tyrion cannot help but wonder ''"When did I make so many enemies?"''

When Kevan comes to visit him that evening, Tyrion realises that his uncle, swayed by Pycelle and Tyaena Merryweather's proclamations, thinks he's guilty. Kevan's manner is cold and distant, and he no longer believes Tyrion's denials. When Kevan relays Tywin's offer to join the Night's Watch in exchange for a guilty plea, Tyrion laughs to his uncle's face, reminding him of how Eddard Stark was offered those same terms and they all know [[Execution of Eddard Stark|how that ended]]. After assuring Tyrion that Tywin will not act in such a reprehensible manner, Kevan delivers a dire warning. This deal is Tyrion's best hope for survival. He has no witnesses and has already been condemned by both Mace Tyrell and the citizenry. Whether he did it or not, the Wall is Tyrion's safest option, as the mob would tear him to pieces should he ever set foot outside.

Shaken, Tyrion thinks about the offer all night. He does not like the idea of bearing the stigma of [[Kinslaying|kinslayer]] and [[Regicide|kingslayer]] for the rest of his life, especially when is guilty of neither.{{Bookref|ASOS|66}}

===Third day of the trial===
[[Varys]] is the only person to testify and his evidence in by far the most damning. Tyrion muses "''Half-truths are worth more than outright lies.''" Unlike the other witnesses, Varys presents documents: parchments painstakingly filled with notes, details, dates, whole conversations. So much material that its recitation takes all day. From these pages Varys confirms:

* How Tyrion schemed to separate Joffrey from [[Sandor Clegane|the Hound]]'s protection.
* His conversation with Bronn about the benefits of having Tommen as king. 
* Tyrion's midnight visit to Pycelle's chambers and the theft of his poisons and potions.
* The threat he made to Cersei the night of their supper. 
* Everything else but the poisoning itself. 

When Oberyn asks him how Varys can possibly know all this, when he wasn't present for any of these events, Varys only giggles and says "My little birds told me. Knowing is their purpose, and mine". Unlike in the show, Tyrion does not question Varys nor have a pseudo-friendship with him. Knowing that he cannot possibly refute Varys's testimony, Tyrion wishes that he have just beheaded Varys the day he arrived at King's Landing.

After Varys leaves, Tywin asks if there are more witnesses, to which Cersei says she has one more, who will speak the following day. Tyrion sarcastically thinks ''"Oh, good. After this farce of a trial, execution will almost come as a relief."''

That night, much to Tyrion's surprise, Prince Oberyn of Dorne pays him a visit. Like Kevan, The Red Viper points out that the trial isn't going well for Tyrion, before mentioning how Cersei has tried to buy his vote, mentioning marriage. Oberyn, however, has other ideas. After exchanging a few insults about Cersei, the Prince, to Tyrion's astonishment, mentions that, according to Dornish law, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Myrcella]] is the heir, and how [[Doran Martell|his brother]] may well crown his ward. This causes Tyrion realises that Oberyn is seeking justice for his [[Elia Martell|dead sister]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (daughter of Rhaegar)|her]] [[Aegon Targaryen (son of Elia Martell)|children]]. The Red Viper proceeds to test Tyrion, by telling him how Tywin informed him that the conveniently dead [[Amory Lorch]] had murdered Elia Martell and her family. With nothing to lose, Tyrion tells Oberyn the truth - Lorch did indeed kill Rhaenys but it was the Mountain who killed Aegon before raping and murdering Elia, with the baby's blood and brains still on his hands. Pleased by this honesty, the Red Viper, suggests getting back at Tywin by saving Tyrion, not as his judge, but as his champion.{{Bookref|ASOS|66}}


===Last day of the trial===
By sunrise, Tyrion has still not made up his mind yet about whether he should falsely admit his guilt or demand a trial by battle. Joining the [[Night's Watch]] wouldn't be too bad, as they need clever men as well as strong ones. Lord Commander Mormont said as much, when Tyrion had visited [[Castle Black]]. It would mean the end of his marriage and whatever claim he may ever have made for [[Casterly Rock]], but he does not seem destined to enjoy either in any case, and there is a brothel in [[Mole's Town|a nearby village]]. However, he cannot guarantee that Cersei would simply let him go, plus he would be confessing to something he did not do. On the other hand, Oberyn is a strong fighter, but can he defeat the Mountain?{{Bookref|ASOS|70}}

When Pod visits him that morning, Tyrion asks if he thinks it did it? When Pod hesitates, Tyrion realises that he does and realises that he is doomed. As Pod fumbles for a response, Tyrion simply says "No need to answer. You've been a good squire to me. Better than I deserved. Whatever happens, I thank you for your leal service."{{Bookref|ASOS|70}}

Not long afterwards, Tyrion is led to the courtroom, where to his shock he sees the final witness is Shae. Tyrion wonders why Cersei bothered to bring her as witness, since ''"Shae knows nothing that can hurt me".'' However, he soon realizes that her purpose is to humiliate him, not to strengthen the evidence against him. Tyrion guesses correctly that Cersei has bribed Shae (in ''A Feast for Crows'', it is revealed Cersei offered Shae a manse in the city and a knight to marry her{{Bookref|AFFC|3}}). 

For her testimony, Shae lies brazenly, claiming that Tyrion and Sansa plotted the murder together after [[Robb Stark|the Young Wolf]] died. Sansa wanted revenge for her brother and Tyrion meant to have the throne. She claims he was going to kill his sister next, then his own lord father, so he could be Hand for Prince Tommen but that after a year or so, Tommen too would have killed, allowing Tyrion to take the crown for his own head. Oberyn asks Shae how could she know all this. She answers that she overheard them, as she wasn't just Sansa's maid but Tyrion's whore, whom he repeatedly molested. 

Sobbing, Shae then lies about the nature of her and Tyrion's relationship. She claims she never meant to be a whore, she was meant to be married, but that Tyrion's wildlings ([[Shagga]] and [[Timett]]) killed her fiancé and brought her to his tent. Tyrion then threatened that if she didn't pleasure him, he'd give her to his wildlings. He then he brought her to the city, so she'd be close when he wanted her, and made her do such "shameful things" with her mouth and other parts. When saying that, tears rolls slowly down Shae's pretty face, making every man in the hall want to take Shae in his arms and comfort her. Shae tells that Tyrion used her every way there was, and he made her call him "my giant of Lannister" (in the show it was changed to "my lion") - a nickname that she actually invented for him and used it often without any coercion. Nearly all the people at the hall, except Tywin and Tyrion, burst out laughing to hear that.{{Bookref|ASOS|70}}

This is the final straw for Tyrion. Enraged at the betrayal and mockery he is receiving, Tyrion now sees Shae for what she really is and is furious at being insulted by the people he saved. Deciding that it is time for payback, he yells at his judges to "Get this lying whore out of my sight and I will give you your confession". Once Shae is gone, he hatefully gives a speech similar to the show, expressing his disgust and hatred for the treacherous citizens of King's Landing (making it very clear he regrets saving them) before demanding a trial by combat. Delighted Cersei urges the judges to accept, annoucing Gregor Clegane as her champion. In contrast, Tywin is so angry that he cannot speak, prompting Mace Tyrell to ask if Tyrion has a champion. 

To everyone's surprise, except Tyrion's, Oberyn stands up and immediately volunteers. The uproar generated from this is deafening, and Tyrion takes special pleasure in the sudden doubt he glimpses in Cersei's eyes. It takes a hundred gold cloaks to quiet the throne room again. Tywin who has been silent until this point quickly declares "Let the issue be decided on the morrow. I wash my hands of it". He gives Tyrion a cold angry look, then leaves.

That night, Tyrion feels strangely calm: no matter what will happen, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he'd kicked his father's plans to splinters: if Oberyn wins, it will further inflame [[Highgarden]] against Dorne; Mace Tyrell will see the man who crippled [[Willas Tyrell|his son]] helping the dwarf, who (allegedly) almost poisoned [[Margaery Tyrell|his daughter]], to escape his rightful punishment. On the other hand, if the Mountain wins, [[Doran Martell]] may well demand to know why his brother had been served with death instead of the justice Tywin had promised him; [[Dorne]] may crown Myrcella after all. He sleeps long and deep.{{Bookref|ASOS|70}}

At morning, Tyrion is well rested and with a hearty appetite. After he has breakfast, Oberyn comes to visit him and they chat leisurely. Oberyn is confident that he will win, and invites Tyrion to return with him to [[Sunspear]] after the duel is over. Tyrion agrees, knowing that he should get away from his vengeful sister as far as possible in case Oberyn wins. Oberyn shows Tyrion the spear that he is going to fight with against the Mountain, warning him not to touch it. Tyrion notices the spearhead has a black glimmer. He wonders if it is oil or [[poison]], but decides not to ask. Later that morning, the [[Second trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|duel]] takes place.{{Bookref|ASOS|70}}
