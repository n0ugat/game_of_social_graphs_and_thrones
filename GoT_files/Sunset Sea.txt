The '''Sunset Sea'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} is the great, unexplored ocean lying to the west of [[Westeros]]. Numerous explorers have sailed into the Sunset Sea searching for new lands, but save for few small islands located west of the [[Iron Islands]], nothing substantial has been found (or at least no explorers have returned home alive to talk about it).

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Sunset Sea is considered vast and uncrossable, and very little is known about what lies beyond it. Stories told among the [[ironborn]] claim that [[sea dragon]]s dwell beneath the waves, and one story told by the [[Drowned Men|priests]] of the [[Drowned God]] claim that the ironborn themselves first emerged from beneath the Sunset Sea (though the latter is considered dubious, even among most ironborn).

''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'' mentions that there is a small cluster of islands located 8 days sail northwest of the main Iron Islands chain, ruled by House Farwynd. A lighthouse known as the [[Lonely Light]] serves as the Farwynds' keep and provides guidance for any ships in the area. The sourcebook also mentions that [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]] once dreamed of flying her [[dragon]] [[Meraxes]] as far across the Sunset Sea as she could go. 

The most famous explorer of the Sunset Sea was [[King in the North|King]] Brandon Stark (the unknown number of his line), who sailed west with the most of the [[North]]ern fleet to find new lands and was never seen again. His son, Brandon the Burner, burned the remaining ships in grief and fury. The North has had no significant strength at sea since this time.
