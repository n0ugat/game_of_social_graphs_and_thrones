==Biography==
Jeyne was a member of [[House Marbrand]]. She married Lord [[Tytos Lannister]] and bore him five children: [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]], [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], [[Gerion Lannister|Gerion]], [[Genna Lannister|Genna]], and [[Tygett Lannister|Tygett]].<ref name="finalebook" />

==Behind the scenes==
Jeyne is featured in the family tree of House Lannister in Archmaester [[Ebrose]]'s ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire (Ebrose)|A Song of Ice and Fire]]''.<ref name="finalebook" /> She is not featured in the [[Game of Thrones|series]], but is mentioned in ''[[Histories & Lore]]''.{{Ref|H&L708}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Jeyne Marbrand was the daughter of Lord Alyn Marbrand. She was married to [[Tytos Lannister]] in 235 AC, in a double ceremony with Tytos's older brother [[Tion Lannister]], who married [[Ellyn Reyne]].

Tion died the following year leaving Ellyn Reyne a widow. Ellyn tried to seduce Tytos, but he did not go through with the act; instead Tytos went to Jeyne and confessed it all. Jeyne forgave her husband, but not Ellyn. Jeyne went to her father-in-law, Lord Gerold Lannister, who married Ellyn off to [[Walderan Tarbeck]], thereby removing her from [[Casterly Rock]].

Jeyne remained and gave birth to five children in total. In 242 AC, she birthed Tytos a son [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]]. Two years later she gave birth to [[Kevan Lannister|Kevan]], and the year after that a daughter Genna. Jeyne also had another son, Tygett.

Giving birth in 255 AC for the fifth time, Jeyne delivered a healthy son Gerion, but she died within a moon's turn. Tytos had always been known as the Laughing Lion, but his grief over Jeyne's death affected him deeply, and Tytos was never referred to by that title again in his life.
