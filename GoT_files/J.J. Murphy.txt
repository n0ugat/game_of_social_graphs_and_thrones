}}'''James “J.J.” Murphy''' (May 7, 1928 – August 8, 2014) was a Northern Irish actor.

He was cast in the role of Ser [[Denys Mallister]], a member of the [[Night's Watch]]. Murphy died just four days after completing his first scenes for ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/actor-j-j-murphy-dies-filming-game-thrones-season-5/ WotW.com]</ref> According to his agent Phillip Young, Murphy was “absolutely delighted”, to be cast “in one of the biggest productions in the world at this stage in his career.”<ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/aug/11/game-of-thrones-actor-jj-murphy-dies-four-days-into-filming The Guardian]</ref>

Co-creators [[David Benioff]] and [[D.B. Weiss]] made an official statement via HBO's Twitter account that the role will not be recast: "We will not be recasting J.J. Murphy. He was a lovely man, and the best Denys Mallister we could have hoped for. And now his watch is ended."<ref>[http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1s3hn4l Official HBO P.R. Twitter Account]</ref>

Apparently [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]] will continue to use those scenes that Murphy already filmed, and possibly rewrite other scenes to work around his absence.
