'''Warden of the South'''{{Ref|GOT702}} is a title traditionally held by the [[Lord Paramount of the Reach]] and [[Lord of Highgarden]], the head of [[House Tyrell]] of [[Highgarden]], since [[Harlen Tyrell]], [[steward]] to the last [[King of the Reach]], [[Mern IX Gardener]], [[Bending the knee|surrendered]] Highgarden and the [[Reach]] to [[Aegon I Targaryen]]. [[Randyll Tarly]], the head of [[House Tarly]] of [[Horn Hill]], was promised the title by [[Cersei Lannister]] but was executed by [[Daenerys Targaryen]] after the [[Battle of the Goldroad]] before it could be bestowed upon him. Although [[Bronn]] was named the Lord Paramount of the Reach and Lord of Highgarden following the extinction of House Tyrell, the title of Warden of the South was bestowed on [[Gendry Baratheon]], the [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands]] and [[Lord of Storm's End]].{{Scriptref|GOT806}}
