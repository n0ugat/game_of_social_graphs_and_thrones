'''Kevin Alexander''' is a Hair Designer working on ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/03/new-s3-video-inside-the-wildlings/ HBO Behind-the-scenes featurette], Game of Thrones Season 3: Inside the Wildlings"</ref>

Alexander's research for [[Costumes|hairstyles in the TV series]] included pre-Raphaelite artists, and painters like John William Waterhouse and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

There are about 20-30 wigs used for major characters in the TV series. Some such as [[Daenerys Targaryen]] actually have three separate wigs on-call at any time (because her wig is white and gets dirty easily). Some of the wigs for main cast members can cost as much as $7,000 each (the longer ones cost more). The wigs are made of real human hair, sourced from India, Europe, and Russia. [[Cersei Lannister]]'s wig, in particular, does not undergo any chemical processing at all: the wig maker sourced individual colors and strands of hair, which were then individually knotted onto a lace cap for her golden blonde blend. Other actors such as [[Kit Harington]] ([[Jon Snow]]) and [[Sophie Turner]] ([[Sansa Stark]]) do not wear wigs, but have their hair dyed.<ref>[http://fashionista.com/2012/06/game-of-thrones-hair-and-wardrobe-secrets-revealed ]</ref>
