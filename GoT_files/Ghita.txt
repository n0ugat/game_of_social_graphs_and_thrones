'''Ghita''' was a ten year old terminally ill girl.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|''Game of Thrones'': Season 5]]===
Ghita is brought to the [[House of Black and White]] by her grieving father, [[Joss (Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken)|Joss]], after various treatment attempts have failed. After assuring her the water has healing properties, [[Arya Stark]] puts the girl out of her misery by giving her the poisoned water from the pool in the central sanctuary.{{Ref|GOT506}}

Arya wears Ghita's face and pretends to be a prostituted child in order to ambush and murder Ser [[Meryn Trant]] in a brothel. Once she completes this task, she returns the face to the [[Hall of Faces]].{{Ref|GOT510}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no character named Ghita. However, many people go to the House of Black and White to seek an end to their misery or that of their loved ones.
