===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Masha Heddle]] is the innkeeper of the [[Inn at the Crossroads]].{{Ref|GOT104}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Jon Heddle is the earliest known member of the Heddle family. He owned the inn at the crossroads, then called the Clanking Dragon, during the first century after [[Aegon's Conquest]]. His son inherited the inn after he died.

During the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], Lord Darry took offense at the black iron dragon on the sign of the Heddles' inn, because the black dragon had now become a symbol for [[House Blackfyre]]. He hacked it to pieces and threw it in the river.

Ser Tommard Heddle killed three men for the hand of Lord Ambrose Butterwell's daughter in marriage. He also became the commander of the garrison at [[Whitewalls]], Butterwell's seat.

Masha Heddle's grandfather was the innkeeper of the crossroads inn, then called the River Inn, during the reign of [[Maekar Targaryen|Maekar I Targaryen]].

[[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] visited the Heddles' inn as a child. She remembers Masha fondly.

At the start of the [[War of the Five Kings]], [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] hangs Masha for allowing [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] to be taken captive beneath her roof. He takes over the inn and uses it as his quarters. Two years later, the inn is kept by Masha's nephew who is killed by a nobleman. It is then taken over by his daughters Jeyne and Willow Heddle, associates of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners|brotherhood without banners]].
