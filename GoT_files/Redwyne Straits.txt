The '''Redwyne Straits'''{{Guideref|Map of Westeros}} separate the [[Arbor]] from the mainland of [[Westeros]]. They are controlled by [[House Redwyne]] of the Arbor and [[House Hightower]] of [[Oldtown]], who both have ships patrolling the waters. The area overall is under the authority of [[House Tyrell]] of [[Highgarden]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Redwyne Straits are usually peaceful. They are a center of trade, with ships passing through the straits from the city of Oldtown and ports on the Arbor to all parts of Westeros and [[Essos]], as well as the [[Summer Isles]] and [[Stepstones]]. In ancient times the straits were less safe, with the [[ironborn]] sometimes raiding as far south as their waters.

Towns such as Vinetown, Starfish Harbor and Ryamsport sit alongside it.
