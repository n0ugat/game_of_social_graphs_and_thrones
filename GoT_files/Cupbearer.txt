'''Cupbearer'''{{Ref|GOT204}} is a position in a noble's household. A cupbearer acts as a personal servant, assisting a lord or a lady.

Cupbearers may be both either [[Smallfolk|lowborn]] or [[Noble house|highborn]], male or female. It is not unusual for noble boys during their time as squires to serve as cupbearers; even noble girls can get this position as part of their education.

==In the books==
While [[Daenerys Targaryen]] rules [[Meereen]], she has every noble family of Meereen who is of dubious loyalty send her a child as a hostage. These children are made her cupbearers. They serve in the queen's chambers in the [[Great Pyramid of Meereen]], performing such duties as serving wine and food, setting the table, bringing her clothing, and standing guard at her door.

Daenerys hopes having noble children as hostages will halt the killings, but it does not. Skahaz mo Kandaq advises her to kill one for every death done by the [[Sons of the Harpy]], pointing out "''What good are hostages if you will not take their heads?''", but she refuses to kill innocent children. Naturally, Daenerys's enemies see that as a sign of weakness, and that encourages them to continue with the killings.

Following Daenerys's departure from Meereen and [[Hizdahr zo Loraq]]'s arrest, Skahaz urges Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] to kill one of the cupbearers in case the [[Yunkai|Yunkai'i]] kill any of the three hostages that they still hold (Daario, Jhogo and Hero). However, Ser Barristan refuses to allow any harm to come to the children, recalling the fate of [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Rhaegar]]'s children.

The names of Daenerys's cupbearers are:

*Azzak, a boy from the House of Ghazeen
*Bhakaz, a boy from the [[House of Loraq]]
*Dhazzar
*Draqaz
*Grazhar, a boy from the House of Galare
*Jezhene, a girl
*Kezmya, a girl from the House of Pahl
*Mezzara, a girl from the House of Merreq
*Miklaz, a boy
*Qezza, a girl from the House of Galare  




In ''A Feast for Crows,'' [[Doran Martell]] tells his daughter Arianne he'd intended to send her to [[Tyrosh]] when she was fourteen to be a cupbearer to the Archon (he'd hoped it would allow her to meet [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys Targaryen]], who was a guest at the Archon's court at the time, to meet for the first time, given Viserys and Arianne had been secretly betrothed as part of an alliance negotiated between Houses [[House Martell|Martell]] and [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] to overthrow [[Robert Baratheon]]). However, the plan never went ahead because Doran's wife Mellario, who was already enraged about Doran sending their son Quentyn away to be a [[squire]] to [[House Yronwood]] to ease tensions between the Yronwoods and the Martells, threatened to attempt suicide if Doran sent their daughter away as well.
