The '''White Tree of Flames'''<ref name="Dedalvs">[https://dedalvs.com/work/house-of-the-dragon/misc/shrubbery_v4.pdf ''Shrubbery'' version 4 | dedalvs.com]</ref> was a tree in [[Jaehaelor Mataeryon]]'s greenhouse. According to Jaehaelor, it was the only one of its kind.

The tree was famous in the [[Valyrian Freehold]] for the coppery sheen of its leaves. Its roots grew above ground and twisted around its own trunk. Jaehaelor described it with reverence. Maester [[Mikkellion]] raised the possibility that it was a [[weirwood]], and that the [[Old Gods of Valyria]] had some distant relation to the [[Children of the Forest]], though he noted that there was no mention of a face carved into its bark.<ref name="Dedalvs" />
