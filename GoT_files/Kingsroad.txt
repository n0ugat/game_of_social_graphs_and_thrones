The '''Kingsroad'''{{Ref|GOT102}} is the longest and grandest highway in [[Westeros]], running from [[Castle Black]] at the [[Wall]] all the way south to the capital city of the [[Seven Kingdoms|Six Kingdoms]], [[King's Landing]], passing the [[North|Kingdom of the North]] along the way. The Kingsroad runs near [[Winterfell]] but not directly through it. A short road from Winterfell leads to a crossroads where travelers from the castle can turn north to go up the Kingsroad to the Wall, or follow the Kingsroad south to King's Landing.<ref name=":0">"[[The Kingsroad]]"</ref>

The [[Inn at the Crossroads]], in the [[Riverlands]], is a popular stop for travelers on the road. It continues south past King's Landing until it terminates at the great castle of [[Storm's End]], the ruling seat of the [[Stormlands]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
The royal party travels north from King's Landing to Winterfell, spending more than a month on the road<ref>"[[Winter Is Coming]]"</ref>. They travel back the same way, stopping at the Crossroads Inn. At the same time, [[Jon Snow]], [[Tyrion Lannister]], and [[Benjen Stark]] travel north from Winterfell to Castle Black, where the road terminates.<ref name=":0" />

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Yoren]] leads a group of recruits for the [[Night's Watch]] north along the Kingsroad, including [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], [[Hot Pie]], [[Lommy|Lommy Greenhands]], and [[Jaqen H'ghar]]. Also traveling with them is a disguised [[Arya Stark]] (now traveling back north up the Kingsroad), whom Yoren intends to drop off at the safety of Winterfell on their way to the Wall. However, while they are still in the Riverlands south of the Trident River, they are accosted by several [[City Watch of King's Landing|Gold Cloaks]], who are looking for Gendry. Yoren manages to scare them off but they promise to return with more men.<ref>"[[The Night Lands]]"</ref> The Gold Cloaks follow through on their threat and return with House Lannister soldiers led by Ser [[Amory Lorch]]. They attack during the night when the Night's Watch recruits have camped just off the Kingsroad. Yoren and Lommy are killed in the ensuing skirmish, while Arya, Gendry, and the rest are taken as prisoners to the nearby castle of [[Harrenhal]].<ref>"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]"</ref>

[[Tywin Lannister]]'s army makes a swift, forced march from [[Harrenhal]] down the west side of [[Gods Eye]] lake and down the Blackwater River. In the northern [[Kingswood]], his army unites with the army of [[House Tyrell]] coming up the [[Roseroad]], and the two united armies continue north along the brief stretch of the Kingsroad between the point where it joins the Roseroad and King's Landing. When they arrive at the city, they decisively defeat the forces of [[Stannis Baratheon]] at the [[Battle of the Blackwater]].<ref>"[[Blackwater]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
Jon, the [[Warden of the North]] who had declared his allegiance for [[Daenerys Targaryen]] as the [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Queen of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men]], marches along with the surviving [[Dothraki]] and the army of the [[North]] on the Kingsroad in order to besiege King's Landing and overthrow [[Cersei Lannister]]. He separates from his forces after crossing the [[Trident]] and heads to [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] after Cersei refuses to surrender.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Kingsroad extends for over two thousand miles from Storm's End to the Wall. Its quality varies from place to place, but it greatly speeds travel in the northern half of the continent. The road was built over two centuries ago during the reign of King [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], using existing roads and pathways where possible.
