'''Riddell''' was a member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Riddell is a member of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]. It is not clear whether he was one of the rogue members, but it is possible as he is in the company of [[Gatins]] and not with the main group.{{Ref|GOT608}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
Gatins is bragging about what an excellent kisser he is and asks [[Steve]] and Riddell if they want to learn. Riddell watches closely as Gatins begins to demonstrate on Steve, which turns into a prank. Riddell and the others see [[Sandor Clegane]] walking up behind Steve, whom the Hound beheads. Before Riddell can run, he is impaled in the chest by the Hound.{{Ref|GOT608}}
