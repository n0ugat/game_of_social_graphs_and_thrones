'''Jonquil''' is a heroine of a legend.

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
[[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] points out to [[Arya Stark|Arya]] that most girls are primarily interested in the pretty maidens from the songs, like Jonquil, and tying flowers in their hair. Arya is more interested in warrior-princesses, like [[Visenya Targaryen]], than pretty maidens in epic romances like Jonquil, and feels that "most girls" are idiots, much to Tywin's amusement.{{Ref|GOT207}}
