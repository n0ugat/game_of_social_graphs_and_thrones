'''Olivia Catherine Cooke Wilde''' (born 27 December 1993), also known as '''Olivia Kate Cooke''', is an English actress. She portrays [[Alicent Hightower]] in ''[[House of the Dragon]]''.<ref>[https://twitter.com/GameOfThrones/status/1337498103197339649 Game of Thrones Official Twitter,] December 11th 2020.</ref>

==Background==
Cooke was born on December 27, 1993, in [[Wikipedia:Oldham|Oldham]] - part of the Greater Manchester area. She attended Royton and Crompton Academy and studied drama at Oldham Sixth Form College, leaving before the end of her A-levels to appear in ''Blackout'' (2012).

Cooke is best known for co-starring in ''Ready Player One'' (2018). She also appeared as a series regular on ''Bates Motel'' for its entire run (2013-2017), and in the film ''Thoroughbreds'' (2017). Later Cooke played the lead role in the 2018 miniseries adaptation of ''Vanity Fair''. 

On December 11, 2020, it was announced that she would be playing [[Alicent Hightower]] in ''[[House of the Dragon]]''.

Olivia Cooke is two years younger than [[Emma D'Arcy]], who plays Alicent's step-daughter [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]]. In the books, Alicent is nine years older than Rhaenyra - still a small age gap, because Alicent isn't her biological mother. The books state that even in her 40's, Alicent continued to look notably young for her age, while Rhaenyra was haggard from several difficult pregnancies that left her looking older than her years. The result was that the visible age difference between Alicent and Rhaenyra seemed even smaller.

On a day to day basis, most people who know Olivia call her "Liv".<ref>[https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/olivia-cooke-and-naomi-scott-discuss-self-tapes-and-self-doubt Interview magazine,] February 2021</ref>
