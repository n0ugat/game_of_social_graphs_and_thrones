Van Houten discussed her role in an interview with Cyril Falisse from the Ferryman Critical on February 22, 2012. She said "I think I am only in episodes 1, 2, 4 and 10 or something. You are not going to see me that much but in season 3 that we are going to shoot this summer I'll come back with a vengeance." Regarding her role she said "I'm [<nowiki/>[[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]]'] right hand. I manipulate him. I take the decisions for him almost. I wouldn't say I'm a very sympathetic character.

==Behind the scenes==
*Carice van Houten was originally asked to audition for the role of [[Cersei Lannister]]. <ref>https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/31/how-game-of-thrones-changed-my-life-season-8-interviews-stars</ref> However, schedule conflicts prevented her from auditioning. She was subsequently asked to audition for the role of Melisandre and was cast in this role instead. <ref>http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/trivia</ref> She later said, "it all turned out for the best, because [[Lena Headey|Lena]] couldn't be a better Cersei." <ref>https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/carice-van-houten-know-game-thrones-ending-1187050.html</ref>
