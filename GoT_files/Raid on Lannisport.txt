{{Quote|Weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part.|[[Jaime Lannister]] to [[Euron Greyjoy]]|Dragonstone (episode)}}
The '''raid on Lannisport'''{{Ref|H&L202}} was one of the opening attacks of the [[Greyjoy Rebellion]], taking place approximately nine years before the [[War of the Five Kings]]. 

==History==
===Background===
The [[Lannister fleet]], docked at [[Lannisport]] was destroyed in an attack carried out by [[Euron Greyjoy]], brother of [[Balon Greyjoy]], who had crowned himself [[King of the Iron Islands|King]] of the [[Iron Islands]].

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] remembers seeing the Lannister fleet burning at Lannisport, implying the fire was visible from [[Casterly Rock]]. He tells [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] his uncles were responsible.<ref name="E4">"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref>{{Note|In the books, Victarion Greyjoy carries out the plan devised by Euron. But since Victarion is not introduced in the show, Tyrion seems to be referring to [[Aeron Greyjoy]] as the other uncle with Euron.}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
[[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] recalls Euron burning the Lannister fleet at [[Casterly Rock]] (actually it took place in Lannisport), the very act which started the Greyjoy Rebellion, when he meets with [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] to propose to her and form an alliance. Jaime goes on to recount how he killed many [[ironborn]], which Euron is grateful of since the Iron Islands were "overcrowded" and how it led to Euron's exile, which made him the "greatest captain of the fourteen seas," discomforting Jaime.<ref name="E61">"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

==In the books==
﻿In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the attack on Lannisport was the first stage of the Greyjoy Rebellion, devised by Euron but carried out by his brother [[Victarion Greyjoy|Victarion]], Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet; he personally flung the first torch onto Tywin's flagship. That was, however, the ''only'' successful stage of the rebellion; from that point, the ironborn were repeatedly defeated until Balon surrendered.

The destruction of the Lannister fleet (which consisted of about twenty to thirty ships) gave the ironborn freedom to launch the next stage of the rebellion - an [[Assault on Seagard|attack against Seagard]] - and raid the coastline.

Balon hoped that the destruction of the Lannister fleet would give the ironborn naval supremacy over the [[Sunset Sea]], but was wrong; [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] eventually defeated Victarion's Iron Fleet in a [[sea battle off Fair Isle]], allowing Robert to invade the rebellious Iron Islands.

In the fourth novel, Euron spreads rumors about his past deeds, taking the credit for destroying the Lannister fleet as if he performed that himself, not just planned it.{{Bookref|AFFC|18}}

During the [[second siege of Meereen]], when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] hears that the Iron Fleet are attacking the [[Yunkai|Yunkish]] fleet blockading [[Slaver's Bay]] and landing troops on the shore to attack the besiegers' camp, he recalls the raid on Lannisport, musing to himself that the [[Wise Masters]] and their slave soldiers stand no chance against the ironborn's savagery.{{Bookref|TWOW|Tyrion I}}
