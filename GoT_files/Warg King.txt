{{Quote|The last Warg King was slain at Sea Dragon Point along with all his sons and beasts.|[[Sansa Stark]]|Northern Allegiances to House Stark}}
The '''Warg King''' was one of the many [[King]]s of the [[First Men]].

==Biography==
The Warg King opposed the rule of [[House Stark]]'s rule of the [[North]] during the [[Thousand Years War]]. He was killed alongside all of his sons and [[Warg|beasts]] at [[Sea Dragon Point]].{{Ref|H&L609}}

==In the books==
In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', the Warg King was a [[Warg|skinchanger]] and a monarch who ruled after the [[Long Night]] in what later became known as the [[North]]. Documents at the [[Nightfort]] indicate that he ruled [[Sea Dragon Point]] and allied himself with the [[Children of the Forest]], though they were defeated by the [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] of [[House Stark]]. Once the Starks killed him along with his sons, beasts and [[greenseer]]s, they took his daughters as prizes.
