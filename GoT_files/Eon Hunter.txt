Lord '''Eon Hunter'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} is the Lord of [[Longbow Hall]] and the head of [[House Hunter]], a vassal family to [[House Arryn]] of the [[Eyrie]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Lord Hunter is present when [[Tyrion Lannister|Tyrion]] demands a [[First trial by combat of Tyrion Lannister|trial by combat]] for the charges of murdering [[Jon Arryn]] and conspiring to murder [[Bran Stark]]. After a [[Lynderly knight|young knight]] offers to champion for [[Lysa Arryn]], Lord Hunter asks for the chance to avenge the death of Lord Arryn as well. Ultimately, [[Vardis Egen|another knight]] champions for Lysa, and is defeated by [[Bronn]].{{Ref|GOT106}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Eon Hunter is the head of House Hunter of Longbow Hall and has been so for nearly sixty years. Half-crippled by gout, Lord Eon is older than Jon Arryn and has three quarrelsome sons: Gilwood, Eustace and Harlan. He is one of the many suitors of Lysa Arryn.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] hears that Lord Eon died suddenly, and Eustace and Harlan were accusing their elder brother Gilwood of murdering him. 

In ''A Feast for Crows'', [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] reveals to Sansa that Harlan is responsible for Lord Eon's death, and he will probably kill his elder brother too.
