{{Quote|When an [[Ironborn]] falls, we say the [[Drowned God]] needed a strong oarsman and took him below to feast in the god's watery halls, attended by mermaids.|[[Yara Greyjoy]]|The Drowned God}}
'''Mermaids'''{{Ref|GOT103}} are legendary creatures said to dwell in the seas. According to myth, the [[Grey King]] took a mermaid as his wife.<ref>"[[House Greyjoy (short)|House Greyjoy]]"</ref> Mermaids are also said to serve and attend those [[Ironborn]] who drown in the sea and are believed to reach the watery halls of the [[Drowned God]].<ref>"[[The Drowned God]]"</ref>

Some representations of [[Elenei]], the mythical wife of [[Durran Godsgrief]], depict her as a mermaid before she became a mortal woman.<ref>"[[The Age of Heroes]]"</ref><ref>"[[The Stormlands]]"</ref>

When [[Jeor Mormont]] tells [[Tyrion Lannister]] that some of the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] that the [[Night's Watch]] have captured claim to have seen the [[White Walkers]], Tyrion dismisses this by saying that sailors at [[Lannisport]] claim to have seen mermaids.<ref>"[[Lord Snow]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, mermaids are dismissed as legendary creatures that don't exist in real life. Sometimes drunken love-sick sailors who have been at sea too long report seeing them, but these always turn out to be sea cows, etc.
