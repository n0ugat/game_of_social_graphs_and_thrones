{{Quote|Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. I saw my god's house burn, there where I had healed men and women beyond counting. In the streets I saw piles of heads... the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that I had cured of fever just three moons past. So... tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?|Mirri Maz Duur to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]|Fire and Blood}}
'''Mirri Maz Duur''' was a [[Lhazareen]] [[godswife]] enslaved by the ''[[khalasar]]'' led by [[Drogo]]. 

==Biography==
===Background===
Mirri Maz Duur is a [[godswife]] - a healer and wise woman - living amongst the [[Lhazareen]], worshippers of the [[Great Shepherd]].{{Ref|GOT108}} She's also a ''[[maegi]]'', a practitioner of [[bloodmagic]].{{Ref|GOT109}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[File:Mirri Maz Duur 1x09.png|thumb|Mirri Maz Duur prepares to sacrifice Drogo's stallion]]
Duur's village is raided by the [[Dothraki]] [[khalasar]] under Khal [[Drogo]]. The captive women are taken into slavery and raped. [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] orders that the Lhazareen women - including Mirri Maz Duur - be handed over to her custody to protect them. One of Drogo's warriors, [[Mago]], objects. When Drogo agrees to Daenerys's request, Mago challenges Drogo to single combat. Drogo kills Mago, but takes a minor [[arakh]] wound to his chest. Mirri Maz Duur volunteers to heal the wound, saying that she is a godswife, or priestess of the Lhazareen god, the Great Shepherd. Drogo's bloodrider [[Qotho]] objects, calling Duur a ''[[maegi]]'' - a witch - but Drogo accepts her offering at Daenerys's urging.{{Ref|GOT108}}

[[File:Mirri 1x10.png|thumb|Mirri Maz Duur awaits her death]]
In spite of - or maybe because of - Mirri Maz Duur's attentions, Drogo's wound becomes infected, making him seriously ill, and he falls from his horse, a sign of weakness among the Dothraki that threatens his position of ''khal''. Duur claims that she can save him, but requires a blood sacrifice. She suggests killing [[Drogo's stallion]]. Qotho becomes enraged at her use of magic to save Drogo and tries to stop the ceremony, but is killed by [[Jorah Mormont]]. Daenerys is thrown to the ground during the fight and goes into labor, so Mormont takes her into the tent where Duur is carrying out the ceremony – in spite of Duur's strict warning not to interrupt – to ask for her aid.{{Ref|GOT109}}

When Daenerys awakens she learns that her son was stillborn and malformed. She finds Drogo alive but in a vegetative state. Daenerys asks desperately when will Drogo be as he was, and Duur answers: "''When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east, when the seas go dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves''." Duur explains that Daenerys got what she traded for, and that before she was "saved" by Daenerys, she had already been raped several times and her temple had been burned. Now thanks to her spell, neither Drogo nor [[Rhaego|his son]] will cause any more suffering. Daenerys builds a funeral pyre for Drogo and orders Jorah to bind Duur to the pyre. The ''maegi'' claims she won't scream. She begins chanting as the flames slowly engulf her, though her singing quickly changes to shrieks of pain as she is burnt alive. True to Daenerys's word, Duur dies screaming.{{Ref|GOT110}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
At [[Vaes Dothrak]], Daenerys tells [[Moro]] and other present khals that she has been there before, and the ''[[Dosh Khaleen]]'' pronounced her child the [[stallion who mounts the world]]. Moro contemptuously responds that she trusted a sorceress, like a fool, and that led to the deaths of her child and Drogo.{{Ref|GOT604}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
Mirri is briefly referred to by Daenerys when she explains to [[Jon Snow]] that she cannot have any children. Jon points out that the "witch who killed her husband and cursed her" is not a particularly reliable source of information as to her current health.{{Ref|GOT707}}

==Abilities==
'''Bloodmagic'''

Mirri Maz Duur was a ''[[maegi]]'', and thus had the knowledge and power to perform [[bloodmagic]], as shown with her ritual on ''[[Khal]]'' [[Drogo]] to presumably resurrect him, which actually left him in a persistent vegetative state.

'''Healing'''

Being a [[Lhazareen]] [[godswife]], Mirri Maz Duur would have been very accomplished in forms of healing.

==In the books==
[[File:Roman Papsuev - Mirri Maz Duur.png|thumb|300px|right|Mirri Maz Duur by Roman "Amok" Papsuev.©]]
Mirri Maz Duur's role in the series is largely unchanged from the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, with the books giving more details about her history. She is the godswife of a Lhazareen village and is rumored to have unearthly powers. Her mother had been a godswife before her and taught her all the spells and songs. As a young girl, Mirri had traveled to [[Asshai]] to learn the arts of the [[shadowbinder]]s. She also studied the lore of the moonsingers of the Jogos Nhai, the herb lore of the Dothraki, and medicines and anatomy with the then-traveling [[Archmaester]] Marwyn.

Duur's treachery makes Daenerys reluctant to trust [[Quaithe]], who, among other things, seems to imply that Daenerys should visit Asshai next. When Daenerys was at the [[House of the Undying]], one of the prophecies she heard was "Three treasons will you know, once for blood and once for gold and once for love".{{Bookref|ACOK|48}} Daenerys believes that Mirri Maz Duur committed the blood treason.{{Bookref|ACOK|63}}
