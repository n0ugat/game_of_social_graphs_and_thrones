'''Alfie Evan Allen''', also known as '''Alfie Owen-Allen''', (born 12 September 1986) is an English actor.

==Biography==
He is the son of actor and comedian [[wikipedia:Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] and the brother of singer [[wikipedia:Lily Allen|Lily Allen]]. His most notable role so far has been a well-received 2009 stint as the lead in the play ''[[wikipedia:Equus (play)|Equus]].''

He stars in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as [[Theon Greyjoy]]. He was announced in the role on 20 August 2009. He was part of the initial starring cast and has remained a member appearing on all subsequent seasons since. Along with [[Iwan Rheon]] ([[Ramsay Bolton]]) and [[Joe Dempsie]] ([[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]]), Allen initially auditioned for the role of [[Jon Snow]], which ultimately went to [[Kit Harington]].<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/39270/game-of-thrones-season-5-what-we-learned-from-the-blu-rays Season 5 Blu-ray commentary]</ref>

Allen explained that Theon hasn't seen his own father [[Balon Greyjoy]] in nine years since he was a small child, so logically he doesn't know him very well. Therefore, as part of method acting, Allen intentionally avoided actor [[Patrick Malahide]], who plays Balon, at all times except for when they were actually shooting scenes in front of the cameras, to maintain a level of unfamiliarity and uncertainty between them.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/the-daily-raven-special-interview-with-alfie-allen/ Alfie Allen Post-Season 2 interview]</ref>
