==Biography==
===Background===
Ryam is a [[Knighthood|knight]] of legendary reputation.{{Ref|H&L707}} Originally of [[House Redwyne]], he serves [[Viserys I Targaryen]] as [[Lord Commander]] of the [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]], as he served [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen|Jaehaerys I]] before him.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Ryam is present at the [[Great Council at Harrenhal]], guarding King Jaehaerys.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Nine years into the reign of King Viserys I Targaryen, Ryam stands guard at a [[Small Council]] meeting at the [[Red Keep]], during which the [[Triarchy]] and the [[Heir's Tournament]] are discussed.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Ryam stands guard at the Small Council meeting that discusses Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]]'s actions with the [[City Watch of King's Landing|City Watch]] and the criminals of [[King's Landing]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Ryam watches over the king in the royal box during the Heir's Tournament.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Ryam is present with his Kingsguard brothers at the funeral of Queen [[Aemma Arryn|Aemma]] and Prince [[Baelon Targaryen|Baelon]] as they are cremated by the [[dragon]] [[Syrax]]'s flames.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Ryam escorts Viserys into a Small Council meeting and places his stone ball down for him on the table. He follows a furious Viserys out of the council chamber after the line of succession is debated.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Ryam announces [[Alicent Hightower]] to King Viserys in his chambers, when she pays the king a visit to offer her condolences for his wife and son.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Ryam guards the king at a Small Council meeting, during which Daemon is reported to have held a celebratory party at a pleasure house on the [[Street of Silk]] and is claimed to have dubbed Baelon the "Heir for a Day." He protects Viserys in the [[throne room]] when he confronts his brother Daemon about these claims. Ryam draws his sword and moves to block Daemon's path when he tries to step toward the king seated on the [[Iron Throne]].{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Ryam escorts Princess [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] to see her father at the shrine to [[Balerion]]. He is present with his Kingsguard brothers at the ceremony naming Rhaenyra as [[Princess of Dragonstone]] and heir to the Iron Throne.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Five months later, Ryam dies in his sleep from a long illness. He is succeeded as Lord Commander by Ser [[Harrold Westerling]], while his place in the Kingsguard is granted to Ser [[Criston Cole]].{{Ref|HOTD102}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', Ser Ryam Redwyne served as [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard]] during the reigns of [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|Kings]] [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]] and [[Viserys I Targaryen]]. He also served as [[Hand of the King]] for a year during Jaehaerys's reign. He was was considered the greatest [[Knighthood|knight]] of his day, being skilled with both [[Armament|sword and lance]]. He was admired by Ser [[Duncan the Tall]], who recalled him defeating terrible foes.

He dueled Ser Clement Crabb in 98 AC at a [[Tournament|tourney]] to celebrate King Jaehaerys's fiftieth year on the throne. They broke thirty lances against each other before the [[king]] declared them co-champions, which is often called the finest display of jousting in the history of [[Westeros]].

He was named Hand of the King following the death of the previous Hand, [[Septon]] [[Barth]], in 99 AC. He is considered to be one of the worst Hands in the history of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] and was replaced by the king's son and heir, [[Prince of Dragonstone|Prince]] Baelon, after less than a year. Ryam died in 105 AC and was replaced as [[Lord Commander of the Kingsguard|Lord Commander]] by Ser [[Harrold Westerling]].

[[Jon Snow]] would pretend to be Ser Ryam when he and [[Robb Stark]] would play together as children, with Robb pretending to be King [[Daeron I Targaryen]]. [[Bran Stark]] dreams of becoming a knight of the [[Kingsguard]] like Ryam, and [[Sansa Stark]] hopes to be saved by Ser Ryam, Florian the Fool, and [[Prince]] [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]] during a nightmare following the [[riots in King's Landing]].

Ser [[Davos Seaworth]] is reminded by [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Pylos]] that Ryam served poorly as Hand despite his high birth and knighthood, and [[Petyr Baelish]] sings Ryam's praises to convince Ser [[Loras Tyrell]] to join the Kingsguard. [[Jaime Lannister]] considers himself unworthy to hold a position once held by Ryam.
