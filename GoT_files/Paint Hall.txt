The '''Paint Hall''' studios are a large film studio in [[wikipedia:Belfast|Belfast]], [[wikipedia:Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]. Originally part of the Harland and Wolff shipyard, where parts of the ''RMS Titanic'' were built, it is now the largest film studio in Europe.

Many large interior sets were constructed inside the Paint Hall for ''[[Game of Thrones]],'' including [[Winterfell]], [[Castle Black]], the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], the High Hall of the [[Eyrie]], and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]]'s throne room in the [[Great Pyramid of Meereen]]. They were disassembled and put into storage when not in use. Sets for the Eyrie's sky cells were built in a car park.

Outside the Paint Hall, there is a monument dedicated to ''Game of Thrones'' called "The Iron Throne - Glass of Thrones." It features a stained-glass window depicting the [[Iron Throne]] with a ledge for tourists to sit on, creating the appearance they are sat on the throne.
