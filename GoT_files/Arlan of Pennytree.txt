==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Ser Arlan was a hedge knight who was born in the village of [[Pennytree]]. As a child, he was taken to [[King's Landing]] by his grandfather, who showed him the [[last dragon]], who died later that same year.

As an adult, Arlan defeated Ser [[Damon Lannister]] in a [[Tournament|tourney]] at [[Lannisport]]. In 193 AC, Arlan fought in a melee at King's Landing where he unhorsed the lord of [[House Stokeworth]] and the [[Bastard]] of [[Harrenhal]]. He was defeated by Prince [[Baelor Targaryen]] in a tourney at [[Storm's End]] in 199 AC, with Arlan claiming to have broken seven lances against Baelor, with Baelor claiming that it was only four.

Arlan's nephew Roger served as his squire during the [[Blackfyre Rebellion]], with the two fighting for Lord Hayford. They fought in the [[Battle of Redgrass Field|Battle of the Redgrass Field]], in which Roger and Arlan fought alongside Lord Hayford when he was killed by Lord Gormon Peake. Arlan later found [[Duncan the Tall|Dunk]] in the slums of [[Flea Bottom]] and took him as his squire. They served the lord of [[House Dondarrion]] in the conflict with the [[Vulture King]].

Arlan died of a chill as he and Dunk were traveling to a tourney at [[Ashford]], with Dunk inheriting his [[horse]]s Thunder, Chestnut, and Sweetfoot.

His personal sigil was a silver winged chalice on a brown field.
