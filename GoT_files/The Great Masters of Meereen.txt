==Narration==
'''Missandei''': ''"The [[Great Masters]] of [[Meereen]]." As if calling themselves such could make them so.''

''Thousands of years ago during the height of the [[Ghiscari Empire]], [[Meereen]] was second only to [[Old Ghis]] in wealth and glory. A paradise by the sea if one didn't mind the constant clinking of chains and cracking whips.''

''Slaves built Meereen, and on their backs, the city rested like a litter.''

''Then came the [[dragon]]s of [[Old Valyria|Valyria]]. The Masters of Old Ghis would not bow, so they burned. The [[Valyrians]] tore down their walls, burned their pyramids to ash and sewed their fields with salt and skulls. An old slave woman once told me that the Valyrians intended to break the chains of the [[Ghiscari]] slaves, absorbing them into the [[Valyrian Freehold]] where every man held a vote.''

''But the Great Masters of Meereen received their new overlords in the [[Great Pyramid of Meereen|Great Temple]], plying them with gold, wine and all the wealth that [[slavery]] had bought them, and the Valyrians instead took up the whip themselves.''

''I do not believe it. As their empire expanded, the Valyrians needed more and more bodies to feed their mines and colonies, where no wage could ever tempt a free man.''

''The Great Masters merely accommodated their new customers, staying rich as the Ghiscari Empire crumbled. After the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]] fell on Valyria, the Great Masters worried for their fortunes. By this time the Valyrians were their greatest providers and purchasers of slaves. Then the [[Dothraki]] horselords swept out of the plains of [[Essos]] and proved to be as fond of slaving as the [[dragonlord]]s before them. The Great Masters grew richer still.''

''For the first time in its history, the Great Masters alone ruled Meereen and chaos ruled the rest of the world. The [[Fighting pit|fighting pits]] swallowed men who in previous centuries would have filled the ranks of the Valyrian armies.''

''Without these soldiers to maintain order, the wealthy had to [[Unsullied|buy their own]], which the [[Good Masters]] of [[Astapor]] were more than willing to sell. If the buyer's nerves still needed calming, the [[Wise Masters]] of [[Yunkai]] could sell him [[Prostitution|further release]].''

''The Great Masters. The Good Masters. The Wise Masters.''

''Yet none were so great, good or wise that they recognized [[Daenerys Targaryen|our queen]] for what she was.''

''Her ancestors had destroyed them, then become them. Perhaps they assumed she would bend as easily. But our queen does not bend. She breaks.''
