The '''King's Justice'''{{Ref|GOT102}}{{Note|'''Queen's Justice'''{{Ref|GOT703}} in the case of a ruling queen.}} is the title held by the royal executioner of the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. His duty is to execute anyone condemned by the [[king]], the [[Hand of the King]], or the [[Small Council]], usually by public beheading.{{Ref|GOT102}}

Ser [[Ilyn Payne]] was the King's Justice under [[Robert Baratheon|Robert I]]{{Ref|GOT102}} and [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey I]].{{Ref|GOT109}}

The term "king's justice" is also employed to refer to the manner in which lords carry out justice in the name of the king. The king or the Hand may send lords or knights to "bring the king's justice" (capture or death) to brigands or anyone who disrupts "the king's peace."{{Ref|GOT104}}{{Ref|GOT106}}
