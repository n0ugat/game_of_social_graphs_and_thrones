He is best known for his role in the film ''[[wikipedia:The Full Monty (film)|The Full Monty]]'' and in the television comedy series ''[[wikipedia:The Thin Blue Line (TV series)|The Thin Blue Line]]'' (which also featured [[Owen Teale]], [[Rupert Vansittart]], [[Ben Crompton]] and Kevin Allen, uncle of [[Alfie Allen]]) and ''[[wikipedia:Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]''. One of his more unusual roles is playing iconic US TV character [[wikipedia:Fred Flintstone|Fred Flintstone]] in ''[[wikipedia:The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas|The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas]]''.

He starred in [[HBO]]'s ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as King [[Robert Baratheon]]. He was announced in the role on 19 July 2009.

Addy read the books prior to filming and found it useful to gain insight into the history of his character. He believes the series grounding in creating a realistic world gives it appeal to non-genre viewers. He sees his character as a foot soldier who is not comfortable as a ruler. Addy is from Northern England and used his natural accent while playing Robert.<ref>[http://www.thevine.com.au/entertainment/tv/game-of-thrones-mark-addy-speaks-exclusively-with-thevine20120203.aspx The Vine interview with Mark Addy]</ref>
