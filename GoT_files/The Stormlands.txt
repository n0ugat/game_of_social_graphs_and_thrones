==Narration==
'''Brienne of Tarth''': ''[[Tarth]] has lulled many a novice sailor into complacency. Our lush island sits on calm blue water like an emerald set into a sapphire.''

''You would never guess that such a vision is only the sheath hiding the blade of [[Shipbreaker Bay]], with its treacherous tides, unpredictable gales, and sharp rocks lurking just below the water's surface.''

''The storms that blow through the bay water the [[kingswood|Kingswood]] and [[rainwood|Rainwood]], two of the great forests of [[Westeros]], and they give the Stormlands their name.''

''Even without our weather, we have more than earned our name in strife. The first [[Storm King]], [[Durran Godsgrief|Durran]], started his reign by declaring war on the gods themselves. He loved the [[Elenei|daughter]] of the sea god and the wind goddess, but they forbade the union.''

''At their wedding, the gods unleashed their might, pulling down his hold and killing all of Durran's family and guests, though his wife shielded him. Durran vowed to rebuild, and when he did, the gods again destroyed his home. His councilors begged him to retreat inland, but he would not abandon his war.''

''Finally, with the counsel of the [[Children of the Forest]], or perhaps a young [[Brandon the Builder|Bran the Builder]], Durran raised a seventh castle that, try as they might and still do, the [[Goddess of the wind|wind]] and [[God of the sea|sea gods]] could not tear asunder. Durran took the name Godsgrief and called his new home [[Storm's End]].''

''Having beaten the waters to the east, the [[Storm King]]s turned their gaze to more practical enemies, the [[Reach]], the [[Riverlands]], and [[Dorne]]. For thousands of years, the Storm Kings fought the [[House Gardener|Gardener]] [[King of the Reach|Kings of the Reach]] and various families of Dorne for control of the [[Dornish Marches]], just below the [[Red Mountains]].''

''The fighting did not stop until Dorne married into the [[Seven Kingdoms]], a mere hundred years ago. But still, the houses of the Stormlands, such as [[House Dondarrion|the Dondarrions]], guard the [[Boneway]], the mountain pass into the Marches, against any Dornish incursion.''

''The Storm Kings had greater luck to their north at first. They took the [[Trident]] from the [[River King]]s and built an empire that stretched as far as the [[Neck]]. But then the [[Ironborn]] swarmed out of their islands and pushed the Storm Kings out of the Riverlands. No doubt, the Ironborn intended to expand their empire into the Stormlands. Before they had a chance, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]] landed with his [[dragon]]s.''

''While Aegon burned the [[King of the Iron Islands|kings]] of the [[Iron Islands]], [[King of the Rock|the Rock]] and the Reach, his fiercest commander and rumored [[bastard]] brother, [[Orys Baratheon]], set out to subdue the Stormlands. No matter how fierce a warrior he was, no one could have envied his task.''

''Storm's End had seen thousands of years of war and never fallen, but [[Argilac Durrandon|Argilac]], the Storm King, chose not to barricade himself behind its walls and gave Orys the [[Last Storm|battle]] he must have hoped for.''

''Orys slew Argilac and took Argilac's castle, [[Stormlands|kingdom]], [[Argella Baratheon|daughter]], sigil, and House words. [[House Baratheon]] became the [[Lord Paramount of the Stormlands|Lord of the Stormlands]].''

''Targaryen rule quieted the Stormlands for the most part until [[Robert Baratheon|Robert]] [[Robert's Rebellion|rebelled]] against the [[Aerys II Targaryen|Mad King]]. His first challenge came not from the Crown, but from his own bannermen who tried to join forces against him.''

''Robert struck first, [[Battle of Summerhall|defeating three armies in a single day at Summerhall]]. The victory cemented Robert's control of the Stormlands, and he was able to march on the Reach and Riverlands with no enemy to his rear.''

''Yet not all of Robert's bannermen sided with him. Ser [[Barristan Selmy|Barristan the Bold]] came from the Stormlands, but as the preeminent member of Aerys's [[kingsguard]] and greatest knight in the realm, Ser Barristan remained loyal.''

''After Robert's decisive [[Battle of the Trident|victory on the Trident]], Robert sent his own [[Order of Maesters|maester]] to care for his countryman Ser Barristan, who had suffered grievous wounds while fighting so hard to kill him. Later, when the [[Jaime Lannister|Kingslayer]] betrayed Aerys, Robert pardoned Ser Barristan and even took him onto his own kingsguard.''

''When Robert lifted [[Mace Tyrell]]'s ill-managed [[Siege of Storm's End]] and returned to his ancestral home, he realized the dream of all the Stormlords before him – to rule the [[Seven Kingdoms]]. Then Robert died, and his brother [[Stannis Baratheon|Stannis]] killed their other brother, the noble King [[Renly Baratheon|Renly]], with [[Shadow|black magic]].''

''Now the Stormlands again live up to their name, with so many houses [[Battle of the Blackwater|burned on the Blackwater]] and others currying favor with [[House Lannister|the Lannisters]] to seize the survivors' lands. Renly could have saved us. If only I could have saved him.''

''But I vow to teach Stannis a lesson he should have learned growing up in the Stormlands. As lightning gives way to thunder, so too must murder lead to vengeance.''
