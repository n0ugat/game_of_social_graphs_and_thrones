{{Quote|When Aegon the Conqueror landed in Westeros, the High Septon locked himself in a sept for seven days and seven nights. Finally, the Crone lifted her golden lamp, and showed him the path ahead. The High Septon himself would anoint and crown Aegon as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms; and the Faith Militant rallied behind Aegon in governing his newly united land.|[[High Sparrow]]|The Faith Militant}}
This '''[[High Septon]]''' lived during [[Aegon's Conquest]].

==Biography==
[[File:HL5 High Septon prays for guidance in Starry Sept at Aegon I's advance.png|thumb|The High Septon prays for guidance in the [[Starry Sept]], as Aegon Targaryen's army and dragons advance on Oldtown.]]
[[File:HL5 High Septon crowns Aegon I (composite).png|thumb|The High Septon crowns Aegon the Conqueror in the Starry Sept.]]
The High Septon held the position when [[Aegon I Targaryen]] and his sisters [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]] and [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] launched [[Aegon's Conquest|their conquest]] of [[Westeros]]. He locked himself in the [[Starry Sept]] and fasted for seven days and nights, one for each of his gods, during which he prayed to the [[Seven]] for guidance. Eventually, the [[Crone]] lifted her golden lamp and showed him the way forward. He then anointed and crowned Aegon as the [[Lord of the Seven Kingdoms]]. He conceded Aegon's marriages to his sisters as a relic of his [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] heritage, which he hoped would soon fade.{{Ref|H&L502}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the High Septon locked himself in the [[Starry Sept]] and spent seven days and nights praying and fasting, taking only bread and water as nourishment. Upon emerging, he announced that the [[Faith of the Seven]] would not oppose [[House Targaryen]], as the [[Crone]] had shown him that doing so would lead to the destruction of [[Oldtown]] by [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon]]'s [[dragon]]s. Lord Manfred Hightower, a pious man and the Lord of the Hightower, heeded the High Septon's prophecy and kept his forces at Oldtown. He opened the gates of the city and submitted to Aegon's authority, after which the High Septon crowned and anointed Aegon, putting an end to any opposition the [[Westeros]]i people had towards Aegon.

Centuries later, the [[High Sparrow]] recounts the story to [[Cersei Lannister]] during a meeting at the [[Great Sept of Baelor]], stating that he must fast and pray as the High Septon did. She asks if it will be for seven days and nights, and he replies that it will be for as long as it needs to be.
