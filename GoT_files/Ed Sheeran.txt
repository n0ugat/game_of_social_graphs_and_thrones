Outside of his hugely successful career in music, he has had several acting roles, portraying Sir Cormac in the short-lived television series ''{{WPS|The Bastard Executioner}}'' and himself in episodes of ''{{WPS|Shortland Street}}'', ''{{WPS|Undateable}}'' and ''{{WPS|Home and Away}}'' and the feature film ''{{WPS|Bridget Jones's Baby}}''. Fantasy fans will remember him for singing the end credits song for ''The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug''.

In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', he made a cameo appearance in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|Season 7]] premiere, "[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]", as [[Eddie]].<ref>[http://www.makinggameofthrones.com/production-diary/ed-sheeran-on-set ]</ref><ref>[http://fandom.wikia.com/articles/ed-sheeran-game-thrones-tweets ]</ref><ref>[http://fandom.wikia.com/articles/think-ed-sheerans-game-thrones-cameo-wasnt-youre-right ]</ref>

Showrunner David Benioff explained that they gave Sheeran the cameo because Arya actress [[Maisie Williams]] is a big fan of his, and they'd actually been trying to give him a cameo for several years now (it wasn't just a snap decision this year). Benioff said, "We knew that Maisie was a big fan of Ed Sheeran and for years we've been trying to get him on the show so we can surprise Maisie. This year we finally did it."<ref>[

Sheeran's presence brings up a production issue: most actors aren't also trained musicians and singers, so the TV show has actually cut out several major songs that appear in the novels. For example, the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] have an important song in the books called ''The Last of the Giants'', which sums up a lot of their mental state about how their world is ending. The TV production team originally intended to have [[Ygritte]] sing it at some point, but actress [[Rose Leslie]] was so terrified of singing on-camera that she politely refused. Similarly, in Season 2, [[Sophie Turner]] said that what she was most afraid of filming that year wasn't any of Joffrey's torments, battles, or the riot scene, but the ''brief'' moment when she had to sing the [[Mother's hymn]]), because she isn't a professional singer. A few actors on the show were also professional singers, specifically [[Jerome Flynn]] ([[Bronn]]) and [[Kerry Ingram]] ([[Shireen Baratheon]]), so at various points the TV show had them perform songs that other characters do in the novels. Given how reluctant actors with no singing experience are to sing on-camera, in several respects the only guaranteed way to incorporate these book-songs into the TV show is to have professional singers make cameo appearances to sing them. Indeed, in similar fashion, in Season 3, the lead Bolton soldier singing "[[The Bear and the Maiden Fair]]" was a cameo by professional musician [[Gary Lightbody]].

Ed Sheeran deleted his Twitter account a day after this episode aired, as he was being harassed by viewers who felt it was a needless celebrity cameo. Many professional reviews argued against this, citing that it was only a minor cameo, and a cameo by a professional musician was a way to get much-missed songs from the books into the TV show - moreover, many admonished that irate fans should take up such criticisms with the ''showrunners and director'' if they disagreed with it, not by launching personal attacks against a musician who happily responded to a request for a cameo by the producers.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/dragonstone-director-defends-ed-sheeran-casting-offers-insight-episode/ ]</ref>

The [[For hands of gold are always cold, but a woman's hands are warm|song]] that Ed Sheeran's character sings is from the books. A minstrel called Symon Silver Tongue came up with it to mockingly hint that he knew [[Tyrion Lannister]] was continuing his affair with the whore [[Shae]] even though his father told him to break it off - brazenly attempting to blackmail him. Tyrion offered Symon a large sum of money to keep his mouth shut, but Symon demanded more and more; eventually, Tyrion ran out of patience and ordered Bronn to kill Symon, and Bronn disposed of the corpse by selling it to a pot-shop that makes [[Bowl of brown|bowls of brown]] out of "all kinds of meat". The song has added irony, as ultimately, Tyrion murdered Shae by strangling her to death with his chain of office as Hand of the King - a necklace made of stylized interlocking gold hands.
