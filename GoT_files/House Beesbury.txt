'''House Beesbury'''{{Ref|HOTD101}}{{Note|Lyman's surname is Beesbury.}} of [[Honeyholt]] is a vassal house from the [[Reach]], sworn to [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|House Hightower]] of [[Oldtown]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Although he is a vassal to [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|House Hightower]] which supports [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], Lord [[Lyman Beesbury]] supports [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] in the [[Dance of the Dragons]].{{Ref|HOTD109}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
House Beesbury has taken arms and revolted against [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|House Hightower]] in retribution for Ser [[Criston Cole]]'s murder of Lord [[Lyman Beesbury|Lyman]].{{Ref|HOTD206}}

==Known members==
*Lord {[[Lyman Beesbury]]}, Lord of [[Honeyholt]] and [[Master of Coin]] to [[Viserys I Targaryen]]. Killed by Ser [[Criston Cole]].
*Ser [[Humfrey Beesbury]], a [[Knighthood|knight]] during the reign of [[Daeron II Targaryen]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Beesbury is an ancient house, dating from the time of the [[First Men]], though their power has diminished over the centuries. They are vassals of [[House Hightower]]. The Beesburys claim descent from Ellyn Ever-Sweet, one of the many daughters of [[Garth the Gardener|Garth Greenhand]], a legendary figure from the [[Age of Heroes]]. Ever-Sweet was said to love honey so much that became the first beekeeper after making a pact with the King of Bees to care for his children. The house's motto is "Beware our Sting".

The Beesburys declare for King [[Renly Baratheon]] at the onset of the [[War of the Five Kings]], but after his death go over to [[House Lannister]] along with most of the lords of the Reach.

The Beesburys play a very minor role in the novels. The only member of the house that appears is Ser Bertram Beesbury: he meets [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] and [[Brienne of Tarth|Brienne]] at Brindlewood, on their way from [[Harrenhal]] to [[King's Landing]], and tells them about the [[Red Wedding]], much to Brienne's sorrow.{{Bookref|ASOS|62}}

The [[heraldry]] of House Beesbury in the novels is three yellow beehives in a vertical line on black, flanked by alternating yellow and black vertical stripes. The ''[[Histories & Lore]]'' apparently simplified this to just one yellow beehive, on solid black, though behind-the-scenes footage from House of the Dragon shows the three beehive version.

===Known members===
*Lord Warryn Beesbury, Lord of Honeyholt.

With unspecified familiar relationship with the lord of the house there are also:
*Lord {Ben Beesbury}, an old, blind and toothless man, dead not long ago.
*Ser Bertram Beesbury, a red-faced knight. 
*Ser Hugh Beesbury, a young knight.
*{Jeyne Beesbury}, married to Rhaegar Frey. Mother to three Freys (Robert, Walda, and Jonos). Died of wasting illness.
*Beony Beesbury, married to Ser Raymund Frey. Mother to seven Freys (Robert, Malwyn, Serra, Sarra, Cersei, Jaime and Tywin).
*Alys Beesbury, married to Leo Tyrell, from a secondary branch of the Tyrells. Mother to five Tyrells (Alla, Leona, Lyonel, Lucas, and Lorent).
