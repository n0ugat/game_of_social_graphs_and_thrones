'''''The Golden Empire'''''{{Webref|name=NAB |author=George R.R. Martin |date=March 9, 2022 |url=https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2022/03/09/random-updates-and-bits-o-news/ |title=Random Updates and Bits o’ News |website=Not a Blog |access-date=March 10, 2022 }} is the working title for a pitched animated television series of the ''[[World of Westeros]]'' in development at [[HBO]], about the Golden Empire of [[Yi Ti]], located in the far east of [[Essos]].

On July 16, 2021, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' posted a major update that HBO was considering three separate ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' animated projects, one of which was about the Golden Empire of Yi Ti. This region hasn't been visited in the main ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, so this project would apparently draw on the extensive chapter about Yi Ti in ''[[The World of Ice & Fire]]'', the sourcebook published in 2014.<ref name="THR" />

On March 9, 2022, [[George R.R. Martin]] himself gave an update that the project is proceeding well:

:''"Over on the animated side...well, I am not allowed to talk about most of what's happening, except to say that things are moving very fast, and I love love love some of the concept art I am seeing. And...wait, come to think of it, the news leaked several months ago that one of the animated shows would be set in Yi Ti. That's true. Our working title is THE GOLDEN EMPIRE, and we have a great young writer on that one too, and I think the art and animation is just going to be beautiful."<ref name="NAB" />

This confirms that the project has advanced beyond the pitch/negotiations phase to actually having a writer attached as well as concept art, and also that the working title being used now is ''The Golden Empire''.
