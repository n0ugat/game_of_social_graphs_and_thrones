{{Quote|Everyone says Targaryens are closer to gods than to men, but they say that because of our dragons. Without them, we're just like everyone else.|[[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] to [[Viserys I Targaryen]]|The Heirs of the Dragon}}
'''House Targaryen'''{{Ref|GOT101}}{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Targārio Lentrot''}} of [[King's Landing]], known poetically as the '''House of the Dragon''',{{Ref|HOTD101}} is the royal [[Noble house|house]] of the [[Seven Kingdoms]] of [[Westeros]]. A [[2 BC|century]] ago, House Targaryen [[Aegon's Conquest|conquered and unified]] the realm under the leadership of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] and his sister-queens [[Visenya Targaryen|Visenya]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys]].

The Targaryens are of pureblood [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] descent. Their [[Heraldry|sigil]] is a three-headed red [[dragon]] on a black field, and their [[House words|words]] are "Fire and Blood."{{Note|name=Words}}

==History==
===Background===
Once a minor family of [[dragonlord]]s in the vast [[Valyrian Freehold]], the Targaryens were given control of the island of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] in the [[Narrow Sea]] some centuries ago. After the obliteration of [[Old Valyria|Valyria]] in the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]], the Targaryens launched a devastating [[Aegon's Conquest|invasion of Westeros]] using their three dragons, [[Balerion]], [[Vhagar]], and [[Meraxes]], to spearhead their attack. Within a short period of time, six of the seven kingdoms surrendered to the Targaryen leader, [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon Targaryen]], unifying the kingdoms under his dynasty's rule. The seventh and last kingdom, [[Dorne]], defeated the Targaryens in the [[First Dornish War]], and have thus remained independent ever since.

Near the end of the long reign of [[Jaehaerys I Targaryen]], the Old King, a [[Great Council at Harrenhal|Great Council]] was held at [[Harrenhal]] to determine his successor, following the deaths of his sons [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Aemon]] and [[Baelon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Baelon]]. His grandson [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] won the vote by a landslide, and now sits on the [[Iron Throne]]. Viserys was chosen over his older cousin [[Rhaenys Targaryen|Rhaenys]], wife of Lord [[Corlys Velaryon]], on account of their sexes. Viserys is married to Queen [[Aemma Arryn]], and together, they have one daughter, [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]. Without a son, King Viserys's brother, [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]], is the heir presumptive to the Iron Throne.

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Queen Aemma dies giving birth to [[Baelon Targaryen|Baelon]], who dies shortly thereafter as well. After Daemon names Baelon "The Heir for a Day," Viserys pushes him down the line of succession by naming Rhaenyra his heir apparent.<ref name="Heirs">"[[The Heirs of the Dragon]]"</ref> However, Daemon and Rhaenyra marry each other a decade later, making him consort.<ref name="Driftmark">"[[Driftmark (episode)|Driftmark]]"</ref> The families of Rhaenyra and Viserys's second wife, Queen [[Alicent Hightower]], are divided, becoming known with their supporters as the [[Blacks]] and the [[Greens]]. After Viserys's death, the Greens stage a [[coup in King's Landing]] and crown [[Aegon II Targaryen]].<ref name="Green Council">"[[The Green Council]]"</ref> In response, the Blacks crown Rhaenyra as on Dragonstone, dividing House Targaryen and precipitating the [[Dance of the Dragons]].<ref name="Black Queen">"[[The Black Queen]]"</ref>
