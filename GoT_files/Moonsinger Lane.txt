'''Moonsinger Lane'''{{Ref|GOT508}} is a lane in the city of [[Braavos]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of a Moonsinger Lane in Braavos or any other location. Nevertheless, the name is a reference to the Moonsingers, priestesses of the Jogos Nhai. Moonsingers were among the slaves that fled bondage under the [[Valyrian Freehold]] and led the way to the place where Braavos would be founded.
