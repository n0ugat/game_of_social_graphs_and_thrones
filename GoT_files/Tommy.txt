{{Quote|Go on Tommy, shear him good!|Robb Stark to Tommy|Winter Is Coming}}
'''Tommy''' is the barber at [[Winterfell]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Tommy attends to the grooming of [[Robb Stark|Robb]], [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Jon Snow|Jon]] before [[Robert Baratheon|the king]]'s arrival at [[Winterfell]]. He first shaves Robb and then cuts Jon's hair, to Theon and Robb's amusement.{{Ref|GOT101}}

==Behind the scenes==
Tommy is played by behind-the-scenes artisan and weaponsmith [[Tommy Dunne]], who forges the weapons used in the series (the joke of course being that he still uses a "blade" of some kind in his on-screen appearance - as the castle's barber).

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no such character.

==Appearances==
*{{GOT|Winter Is Coming}}
