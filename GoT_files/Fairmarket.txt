'''Fairmarket'''{{Ref|GOT403}} is a town in the [[Riverlands]], the region controlled by [[House Tully]] of [[Riverrun]]. The town is located besides the [[Blue Fork]] of the [[Trident]] and north of the [[Red Fork]], southeast of [[Wendish Town]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
As [[Sandor Clegane]] and [[Arya Stark]] make their way back through the Riverlands, traveling southeast from the [[Twins]] to enter the [[Vale of Arryn]] at the [[Bloody Gate]], they stop at a stream and she asks where they are. Sandor replies that he thinks they are near Fairmarket.<ref>"[[Breaker of Chains]]"</ref>

After the [[battle for the Wall]], [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] eulogizes the dead and mentions the fifty late black brothers came to them ''"from White Harbor and Barrowton, from Fairmarket and King's Landing, from north and south, from east and west."''<ref>"[[The Children]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, while en route to the [[Twins]], [[Robb Stark]] sends scouts to Fairmarket to see if he could cross the Blue Fork there, but they find the wooden bridge washed out.

Three generations before [[Aegon's Conquest]], [[Harren Hoare]]'s grandfather Harwyn Hoare conquered the Riverlands from the Stormlands. Harwyn had no fixed capital afterwards but was constantly on campaign enforcing his reign throughout this new conquests. Harwyn's son Halleck did reign from a new capital on the mainland, a modest castle tower-house at Fairmarket. Halleck's son Harren then had the great dream of building the greatest castle-seat in all of Westeros, [[Harrenhal]] - but it took decades to complete, so it is unclear if Harren continued to rule from Fairmarket or if he ruled from Harrenhal's construction site.
