{{Quote|The last King in the North was Torrhen Stark, who bent the knee to my ancestor, Aegon Targaryen.  In exchange for his life, and the lives of the Northmen, Torrhen Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.|[[Daenerys Targaryen]]|The Queen's Justice}}
King '''Torrhen Stark''', also known as '''the King Who Knelt''', was an ancestor of [[House Stark]] who, as [[King in the North]], [[Bending the knee|bent the knee]] to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]] in [[Aegon's Conquest|his conquest]]. He was the last King in the North until the secession of the [[North]] and the [[Riverlands]] in the [[War of the Five Kings]] and the coronation of [[Robb Stark]].

==Biography==
===Background===
[[File:H&L110.png|thumb|left|Torrhen masses his forces against Aegon I.]]
King Torrhen's reign coincided with [[Aegon's Conquest]], in which the [[Andals|Andal]] kingdoms south of the [[Neck]] submitted one by one to [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. Torrhen amassed his army and marched to meet the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] warlord but by the time he arrived, Aegon had already won the decisive [[Field of Fire]] and conquered most of the south of Westeros. After seeing Aegon's dragons and his massive host, Torrhen realized the war was already lost.{{Ref|H&L110}}

[[File:Torrhen kneels.jpg|thumb|King Torrhen Stark submits to Aegon the Conqueror.]]
Instead of fighting, he chose to [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] and surrendered his crown in order to spare his people. For his submission, Aegon named him Warden of the North. Though some Northerners sneer at Torrhen as "the king who knelt", his descendants [[Robb Stark|Robb]] and [[Sansa Stark]] argue that Torrhen "saved thousands of lives that day" and that his critics forget they are alive today because of him.{{Ref|H&L120}}{{Ref|H&L609}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
At the [[Wall]], [[Cregan Stark]] tells [[Jacaerys Velaryon]] that his ancestor, King Torrhen Stark, initiated a tradition of offering at the onset of winter a tenth of the men from the Starks' household to the [[Night's Watch]]. Jacaerys comments that in this place Aegon I and Torrhen treated, and claims that Torrhen would've sooner died than bent the knee, unless he believed the Conqueror could bring unity to the Seven Kingdoms.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 7|''Game of Thrones'': Season 7]]===
When [[Jon Snow]] appears before [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] on [[Dragonstone]], the latter scoffs when [[Davos Seaworth|Davos]] presents Jon as the [[King in the North]]. She declares that the last person who held that title was Torrhen Stark,{{Note|Daenerys's statement is incorrect, since the last King in the North who preceded Jon was [[Robb Stark]].}} who bent the knee to her ancestor, Aegon the Conqueror, using Torrhen's declaration of loyalty in perpetuity to try and strong-arm Jon into confirming the North's fealty to House Targaryen.{{Ref|GOT703}}

===Spoken about Torrhen===

{{Quote|Surely the great Torrhen Stark would've sooner died than bent the knee,	unless he believed the Conqueror could bring unity to the Seven Kingdoms.|[[Jacaerys Velaryon]]|A Son for a Son}}
{{Quote|After Aegon and his dragons destroyed the combined armies of the Reach and the Rock at the Field of Fire, King Torrhen Stark bent the knee and swore fealty to the Targaryen dynasty in order to spare the destruction of Winterfell and his people. He was forever after known as "the King Who Knelt".|[[Robb Stark]]|House Stark (short)}}
{{Quote|My ancestor, King Torrhen Stark, marched the North down to the [[Trident]] and beheld [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon's]] army, larger than Torrhen's own by half and with three dragons circling overhead. Many northern bannermen wanted to attack anyway, claiming northern valor would carry the day. Others wanted to fall back to [[Moat Cailin]] and make a stand there. But Torrhen had heard how the armies of the Rock and the Reach had burned on the Field of Fire and had seen the fires still glowing beneath the rubble of Harrenhal. He knelt and laid his ancient crown as Aegon's feet and rose as a king no more but Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. Some Northerners still sneer at my ancestor as "The King who Knelt", forgetting that because of Torrhen they're alive today to sneer. Their ancestors didn't leave their burned bones at the Trident and their twisted swords didn't fill Aegon's new [[Iron Throne|throne]].|[[Sansa Stark]]| Northern Allegiances to House Stark}}

==In the books==
[[File:The_King_who_Knelt.png|thumb|Torrhen bends the knee to Aegon and his sisters, forever after becoming known as the King Who Knelt.]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Torrhen Stark's story is the same. It is believed he knelt at the place where the Inn of the Kneeling Man sits at the time of the books.

Torrhen's army numbered about 30,000 men, but the Targaryen army that came to meet him numbered about 45,000 - nor did this represent all of Aegon's new bannermen, just the ones directly facing him. Moreover, the Targaryens had their three huge dragons. Torrhen's bastard brother, [[Brandon Snow]], volunteered to sneak into the Targaryen camp at night and attempt to kill ''all three'' dragons while they slept, but Torrhen judged that this was impossible and that the failed attempt would only invite further retaliation from the Targaryens, so he chose to surrender instead. As a result, neither Torrhen's sword nor the sword of any Northern lord was incorporated into the [[Iron Throne]], as Aegon used only the swords of those he conquered, not those who capitulated.

Torrhen Stark's decision to kneel before Aegon Targaryen saved the North from the devastation inflicted upon the Gardeners and the Lannisters. The Conqueror not only confirmed the Starks as the rulers of the North, but he also allowed them to keep their own customs: the Targaryens' laws would rule over the North, but they could keep their local custom of personally beheading condemned men instead of delegating the task to an executioner. Queen [[Rhaenys Targaryen (sister of Aegon I)|Rhaenys Targaryen]], as part of her efforts to keep the realm together after the Conquest, organized a marriage between Lord Stark's daughter and Lord Arryn. However, although Torrhen had bent the knee, his sons did not want to serve the Targaryens. It was only over their strong protests that the marriage took place, and they refused to attend the marriage. The North remained in the realm, so it can be assumed that Torrhen was able to prevent his sons from rising up against the Targaryens. It is unknown if Torrhen was still alive when Aegon visited Winterfell in 33 AC, during his last royal progress.

In ''A Storm of Swords'', after the Starks suffer a series of losses and the situation seems hopeless, [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]] suggests [[Robb Stark|Robb]] to surrender to the [[House Lannister|Lannisters]]. She reminds him that Torrhen Stark bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror rather than see his army face the fires. Robb answers angrily "Did Aegon kill King Torrhen's father? Never, I said".{{Bookref|ASOS|35}}
