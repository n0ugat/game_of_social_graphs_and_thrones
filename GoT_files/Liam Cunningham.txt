He has appeared in films such as ''[[wikipedia:Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Hunger (2008 film)|Hunger]]'', ''[[wikipedia:First Knight|First Knight]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Jude (film)|Jude]]'', and TV series including ''[[wikipedia:Outcasts (TV series)|Outcasts]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Northanger Abbey (2007 TV drama)|Northanger Abbey]]''. He auditioned for several roles for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 1|first season]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' but did not get any due to scheduling clashes. The producers invited him to audition for [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]] instead.

In ''Game of Thrones'' Cunningham is playing the role of [[Davos Seaworth]]. He was announced in the role on 19 July 2011. He is a starring cast member for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 2|second]], [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third]], [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth]], [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|fifth]], [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|sixth]], [[Game of Thrones: Season 7|seventh]] and [[Game of Thrones: Season 8|eighth]] seasons.

The fingers that Davos loses as a punishment for his smuggling crimes have been moved from his left to his right hand for the TV show, reflecting the fact that Cunningham is left-handed.<ref>[http://www.accesshollywood.com/access-countdown-to-game-of-thrones-season-2-qanda-liam-cunningham-talks-davos-seaworth_article_59908 Access Hollywood interview]</ref>
