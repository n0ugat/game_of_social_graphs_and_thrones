'''Michiel Huisman''' is a Dutch actor who portrays [[Daario Naharis]] from the [[Game of Thrones: Season 4|fourth season]] and onward of ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>[http://winteriscoming.net/2013/08/treme-actor-joins-the-cast/ Winter Is Coming]</ref>

Huisman replaced [[Ed Skrein]], who played the character in the [[Game of Thrones: Season 3|third season]]. Huisman initially joined Season 4 as a guest star but was promoted to the main cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 5|fifth season]], even before Season 4 had aired in 2014. <ref>http://www.hypable.com/2014/01/08/game-of-thrones-season-5-michiel-huisman/</ref> He was part of the main cast for the [[Game of Thrones: Season 6|sixth season]]. Huisman's interpretation of Daario was a more traditional "lovable rogue" type character than Skrein's more esoteric portrayal.

Huisman has made several appearances in Dutch movies before he left to the USA. He appeared with [[Carice van Houten]] in the movie ''Black Book'' (2006). He starred in the [[HBO]] series ''Treme'' (2010-2013) and had recurring roles on the ABC series ''Nashville'' (2012-2014) and on the BBC America/Space series ''Orphan Black'' (2014-2015).

Huisman has also had supporting roles in several American made movies like ''The Young Victoria'' (2009), ''World War Z'' (2013) and ''Wild'' (2014). He had a lead role the fantasy romance movie ''The Age of Adaline'' (2015), which marked Huisman's first lead role in a Hollywood production.

Huisman was originally supposed to star in the upcoming 2016 Horror film ''The Forest'' with fellow ''Game of Thrones'' co-star [[Natalie Dormer]], but had to withdraw from the production due to scheduling difficulties. His role in the film was eventually replaced by American actor Taylor Kinney.

Huisman has been cast to star in a Discovery Channel limited series titled ''Harley and the Davidsons ''with Game of Thrones co-star [[Robert Aramayo]]. The series will focus on the foundation of the motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson, where Huisman will star as Walter Davidson and Aramayo as William S. Harley.<ref>http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/harley-davidson-motorcycles-discovery-series-evan-wright-1201674220/</ref>
