==Biography==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] tasks Addam to deliver a letter to [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]] on [[Dwarfstone]]. Upon reading the message, Daemon beats Addam with his [[Valyrian steel]] helmet before he is stopped by [[Joffrey Lonmouth]] and [[Vaemond Velaryon]]. Addam is helped to stand up by the surrounding individuals.{{Ref|HOTD103}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', the only knight named Addam is Addam Hightower, the [[Lord of Oldtown]] during the reign of [[Aegon I Targaryen|Aegon the Conqueror]]. Addam is a common name in [[Westeros]].

Daemon once almost beat a messenger to death, but the message was about the marriage of Viserys and [[Alicent Hightower]], not regarding the [[War for the Stepstones]].
