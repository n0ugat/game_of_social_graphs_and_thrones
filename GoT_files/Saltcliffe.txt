'''Saltcliffe'''{{Ref|GOT304}} is one of the seven [[Iron Islands]], an archipelago located on [[Ironman's Bay]], on the western side of [[Westeros]].

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
As one of [[Ramsay Bolton|Ramsay Snow]]'s sadistic torments of the captive [[Theon Greyjoy]], before Theon knew his real identity, he pretended to be a spy sent by his sister [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]] to help him escape. When Theon asked who he was, he claimed he was an ironborn from Saltcliffe.<ref>"[[And Now His Watch Is Ended]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Saltcliffe is the least noteworthy of any of the seven Iron Islands, without much of a distinguishing economy, culture, or history.

At least two major noble Houses are located on the island: House Saltcliffe of Saltcliffe, and House Sunderly of Saltcliffe. [[Balon Greyjoy]]'s mother was a Sunderly - grandmother of [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy|Yara]].
