{{Quote|Qoy Qoyi.<br>(Blood of my blood.)|Cohollo to [[Drogo]]|Baelor}}
'''Cohollo'''{{Con|ASOIAF}} was a [[bloodrider]] to [[Khal]] [[Drogo]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Cohollo is a [[Dothraki]] [[bloodrider]] in the service of Khal Drogo. He is one of Drogo's closest allies and a stalwart warrior who favors the ''[[arakh]]''.{{Ref|GOT101}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Cohollo, alongside [[Qotho]] and [[Haggo]], accompanies Khal [[Drogo]] to view his bride, [[Daenerys Targaryen]].{{Ref|GOT101}}

When a drunken [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|Viserys]] threatens Daenerys and her [[Rhaego|unborn child]], Qotho and Cohollo restrain him while Drogo pours molten gold over his head, killing him.{{Ref|GOT106}}

Following the raid of a [[Lhazareen]] village in [[Lhazar]], [[Mago]] defies Drogo. Cohollo, along with his fellow [[bloodrider]]s, steps forward to defend Drogo's honor, only for the Khal to take matters in his own hands.{{Ref|GOT108}}

Drogo's wound festers and he becomes seriously ill. He falls from his horse in front of the ''[[khalasar]]'', a sign of great weakness. Daenerys and then Cohollo kneel to the sides of the khal to check on him, while [[Qotho]] and [[Haggo]] remain mounted. Later, when Qotho takes [[Mirri Maz Duur]] to Drogo and Daenerys's tent, Cohollo accompanies him.{{Ref|GOT109}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Cohollo is the eldest of Drogo's three bloodriders and the most kind to Daenerys. He had saved Drogo from sellswords when he was very young. He's described as a squat bald man with a crooked nose and a mouth full of broken teeth.

During the wedding of Daenerys and Drogo, Cohollo gives them a ''arakh'' chased in gold. When the three bloodriders attempt to stop the [[Mirri Maz Duur]]'s [[bloodmagic]] ritual to heal Drogo, Cohollo is killed by [[Aggo (The North Remembers)|Aggo]].
