'''Maegor III Targaryen''' was a king of the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]]. His reign was presumably after that of [[Maegor Targaryen]] and an unmentioned Maegor II Targaryen.

==Biography==
At some point Maegor the Third tried to outlaw the practice of usury, and cut off both the hands of anyone caught charging interest on loans.{{Ref|GOT509}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no such character. Indeed, there has never been any other king of House Targaryen named Maegor since the infamous "Maegor the Cruel", such was Maegor's repute that later members of the house deliberately shunned the name. In the following generations, only one Targaryen was named Maegor - son of [[Aerion Targaryen|Aerion Brightflame]], a very minor character.

So far, it is unknown if the mention of the name is a deliberate choice by the production (such as intentionally depicting [[Mace Tyrell]] as uneducated for believing there ever was a Maegor III), a mistake from the writers, or a mistake from the actor (the name may have been confused with Maegor ''the First'', who was known for cruel policies and it would not have been uncharacteristic of him to attempt to outlaw usury in a harsh manner).<ref>[http://www.westeros.org/Citadel/SSM/Entry/12392/ So Spake Martin, June 9, 2015]</ref>

[[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]], Mace Tyrell's actor, confirmed that "Maegor the Third" is what was written in the script.<ref>[https://x.com/ashtongriffiths/status/613637647802724352]</ref>

It is also possible that Mace wanted to say "Maegor, the third Targaryen king" but got confused and instead just uttered "Maegor, the third".
