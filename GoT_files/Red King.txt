==History==
[[File:Bolton-bends-the-knee.jpg|thumb|right|250px|King [[Rogar Bolton]] bends the knee to the Starks of [[Winterfell]].]]

Before the [[North]] was unified under the rule of [[House Stark]], House Bolton ruled in their own right over vast stretches of lands east of [[Winterfell]] and styled themselves as the "Red Kings of the Dreadfort". During this time the Boltons were the greatest rival to the Stark [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]], and waged war against them for centuries.<ref name="wfl"/>

After many centuries, the Starks finally forced the Boltons into submission when [[Rogar Bolton]] - last of the independent Red Kings - [[bending the knee|bent the knee]] to the Starks and recognized their rule as Kings in the North.<ref>"[[House Bolton (short)|House Bolton]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, it is believed that the Starks and Boltons have been fighting each other since right after the [[Long Night]] itself and the construction of the [[Wall]], about 8,000 years ago according to legend.

Historians say that the last of the Red Kings, Rogar Bolton, bent the knee to House Stark just as the first ships of the [[coming of the Andals]] were beginning to land in eastern [[Westeros]] - which started about 6,000 years ago. This would mean that the Red Kings reigned for about 2,000 years and were constantly fighting the Starks during that time period (not even counting later Bolton rebellions, of which there were several). The Starks rallied all of the other Northern [[Noble house|houses]] including the Boltons to fight back the Andal invaders when they landed on the coasts, or when they tried to pass through the overland choke point at [[Moat Cailin]].

The territory controlled by the Red Kings of House Bolton apparently covered lands beyond what the Boltons currently possess - perhaps the [[House Karstark|Karstark]] lands to the north and [[House Hornwood|Hornwood]] lands to the south. The [[House Umber|Umbers]] were said to also be independent kings in this time period so they didn't control them, while [[White Harbor]] and lands to the south (now held by the [[House Manderly|Manderlys]]) passed through several hands. Apparently the Boltons never controlled much territory west of the [[White Knife]] river.
