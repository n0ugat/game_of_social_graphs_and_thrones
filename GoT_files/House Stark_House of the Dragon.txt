'''House Stark'''{{Ref|GOT101}} of [[Winterfell]] is a [[Great House]] of [[Westeros]]. They rule over the vast region known as the [[North]]. It is one of the oldest lines of Westerosi nobility by far, claiming a line of descent stretching back over eight thousand years.

==History==
===Background===
Before [[Aegon's Conquest]], the leaders of House Stark ruled over the region as the [[King in the North|Kings in the North]]. The house traces its roots to [[Brandon the Builder|Bran the Builder]], a legendary [[First Men|First Man]] who lived during the [[Age of Heroes]] and founded House Stark. The Starks were not originally the monarchs of the North; they began as vassals to the [[Barrow King]]s, who lost support due to their inactive rule while their ancestor Bran the Builder built the [[Wall]] and protected the [[North]]. They [[Thousand Years War|warred]] with the Barrow Kings, emerging victorious. The Starks ruled as Kings of Winter over one of the many smaller, petty First Men [[king]]doms that were established in the [[North]], with their chief rivals for domination being the [[Red King]]s of [[House Bolton]]. Eventually the Starks [[Unification of the North|united the North]] under them. Although their stronghold of [[Winterfell]] has been the capital of the North, war helped make it it's strongest castle, in opposition to the [[House Reed|Reeds]]' [[Greywater Watch]] and the [[Dreadfort]] of [[House Bolton]], with attacks from from the latter raising the need for more keeps, more walls, more guard towers and the expansion of their granaries and larders to survive sieges. [[Winter town]] would be raised from smallfolk seeking shelter from winter, and these would also join the Stark soldiers in fighting the Boltons. 

They gained a new vassal from the [[Reach]] after [[House Manderly]]'s exile, giving them a new home at [[White Harbor]] in exchange for their guarding the river against pirates. They defeated the Boltons, drove pirates away from the [[White Knife]], slew the last [[Marsh King]] and wed his daughter for the [[Neck]], with it's governance being given to [[House Reed]] and, according to legend, King [[Rodrik Stark]] wrestled with an [[Ironborn]] for [[Bear Island]] and won, giving it to House Mormont. [[Karlon Stark]], a younger son of the King in the North, was awarded lands in the eastern regions of the North after successfully putting down a rebellion led by House Bolton. Over time Karlon's seat of Karl's Hold came to be known as [[Karhold]], and the Starks that descended from him became known as [[House Karstark|Karstarks]].

Although the Starks had to content with defiant Houses in their unification campaign, some chose to submit and become loyal vassals, like the [[House Umber|Umbers]] of [[Last Hearth]] and the [[House Glover|Glovers]] of [[Deepwood Motte]], with even their greatest rivals for dominance, the Red Kings of House Bolton, who made a sinister reputation for themselves with their practice of [[flaying]], with [[Royce IV Bolton|one]] of them being notorious for ripping out the entrails of captive Starks, choosing to bend the knee, and their hostility being put on hold, due to the need for the end of unrest. Their timing proved crucial  just then, due to the [[Andals]] [[Coming of the Andals|landing and invading]] Westeros, swiping all lands of First Men rule except the North due to the other Houses fighting on their own, while the North opposed with a united front, with the Manderlys attacking their ships and the Reeds attacking their incursions into the [[Neck]]. 

King [[Torrhen Stark]] was on the throne at the time of [[Aegon's Conquest]] and marched his army south to face them. He surrendered when he saw the Targaryens' greater host and their [[dragon]]s, despite being suggested to resist from [[Moat Cailin]] or assassinating the sleeping dragons, believing that fighting was futile, due to the Targaryen victories at the [[Burning of Harrenhal]] and the [[Field of Fire]]. He was made [[Warden of the North]], thus escaping the fates of [[House Gardener]] of the [[Reach]] and [[House Hoare]] of the [[Riverlands]] whose lords refused to [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] and were rendered extinct after failing to resist the invaders. Thereafter, Torrhen was known as "the king who knelt", though those who criticize him for this often forget that they are only alive to do so thanks to his surrender.

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
A member of House Stark travels to [[King's Landing]] to participate in the [[Heir's Tournament]]; a joust to celebrate the birth of Prince [[Baelon Targaryen]]. They are passed over by Prince [[Daemon Targaryen]] in favor of Ser [[Gwayne Hightower]], whom the prince selects as his first opponent. They are killed shortly after by a blow to the head from a mace when the tourney descends into a violent brawl.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Lord [[Rickon Stark (father of Cregan)|Rickon Stark]] later attends court, where he swears fealty to King Viserys I, and promises to uphold his decision to name his daughter [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]] as heir to the Iron Throne.{{Ref|HOTD101}}[[File:2x1 Cregan Stark Still.jpg|thumb|Cregan Stark agrees to support the Blacks.|left]]By [[132 AC]], [[Cregan Stark]] succeeds Rickon as Lord of Winterfell. During the [[Dance of the Dragons]], [[Hand of the King]] [[Otto Hightower]] believes that the Starks will declare for King [[Aegon II Targaryen]], as he sent generous terms.{{Ref|HOTD109}} However, the [[Blacks]] note that the Starks have always remembered their oaths, and so [[King#Queens|Queen]] [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] sends her son [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jacaerys]] to meet with Cregan about allying his house with the Blacks.{{Ref|HOTD110}}
