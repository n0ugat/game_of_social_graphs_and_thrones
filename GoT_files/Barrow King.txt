{{Quote|In those days, the Starks were not the greatest house in the North, and Winterfell was not the greatest castle. Barrowton was the oldest, dating to the First King, and the Starks fought the Barrow Kings for a thousand years.|Roose Bolton|Winterfell (Histories & Lore)}}
The '''Barrow Kings'''{{Ref|H&L506}} were a dynasty of [[king]]s who ruled the [[Barrowlands]]. The dynasty went extinct sometime after [[House Stark]] conquered the [[North]] following the [[Thousand Years War]].{{Ref|h&l506}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Barrow Kings claimed descent from the [[First King]] and monarchy over all [[First Men]]. Some of them allied with the [[Marsh King]]s to defeat southron invader who attempted to pass the [[Neck]].

It is claimed by singers that the Barrow Kings fought against the [[King in the North|Kings of Winter]] north of the [[Barrowlands]] in the [[Thousand Years War]]. However, runes of the First Men claim that the conflict only lasted around two hundred years. The conflict ended when the last Barrow King surrendered to [[Winterfell]], with the Stark King receiving his daughter in marriage.

[[House Dustin]] of [[Barrowton]] claim descent from the First King and the Barrow Kings.

Maester Kennet's ''Passages of the Dead'' makes mention of a curse that was supposedly placed on the Great Barrow, weakening and making corpselike any living man who dared to equal the First King. Some [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] believe that the [[Night's King]]'s [[corpse queen]] may have actually been a daughter of a Barrow King, as they were often connected with graves.
