[[File:The Doom of Valyria - Fallen, Fallen is Bablyon.png|thumb|200px|The Doom of Valyria]]
'''Old Valyria''',{{Ref|GOT110}} originally known as simply '''Valyria''',{{Ref|GOT104}} was the capital city of the once-great civilization known as the [[Valyrian Freehold]]. The city of Valyria is located on the eastern continent of [[Essos]], southeast of the [[Free Cities]], on the [[Valyrian peninsula]], a large peninsula extending southwards into the [[Summer Sea]].

Valyria's power was based on the taming and use of [[dragon]]s in warfare, which they discovered in the chain of volcanoes known as the [[Fourteen Flames]] which were located around their homeland.<ref>"[[Valyria & the Dragons]]"</ref> Using dragons, Valyria destroyed the armies of opposing nations and conquered a large amount of territory in Essos. Its empire, the Valyrian Freehold, extended through much of the modern Free Cities and even onto the island of [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]] in the [[Narrow Sea]]. However, Valyria never attempted an invasion of [[Westeros]], which was considered a poor backwater. For over 5,000 years, Valyria was the capital of the greatest civilization mankind had ever seen, the heart of an empire that ruled half the known world.

Valyria practiced some unusual customs outlawed in much of the rest of the world, including permitting [[incest]] and polygamy.

Valyria was destroyed four centuries ago in a catastrophic volcanic event known as the [[Doom of Valyria|Doom]], which shattered the Valyrian peninsula, wiped out almost all the dragons in the world and created the much-feared [[Smoking Sea]]. The only major family of Valyrian [[dragonlord]]s to survive the Doom were the [[House Targaryen|Targaryens]], who were living on Dragonstone at the time. The Targaryen dragons on their island were the only ones in the entire world to survive the cataclysm. A century after the Doom, [[Aegon I Targaryen]] invaded Westeros and conquered almost the entire continent, establishing a dynasty that was to last for three centuries.

==Layout==
Before its destruction, Valyria was composed of four main districts:

The Civic Centre (''Oktio Izultion''),<ref name="Map request" /> the oldest district, served as the city's seat of power. The [[Anogrion]] sat to the left of the main palace.

The Industrial Area (''Boterlion'')<ref name="Map request" /> was situated at the foot of the mountain. It was home to slave quarters, aqueducts, and bathhouses.

The Port (''Vilinion'')<ref name="Map request" /> served as the residential quarter, home to the Valyrian navy as well as teeming street markets.

The Forum (''Vestrion'')<ref name="Map request" /> was the center of social and public life in Valyria. Designed to impress visitors, its buildings were much grander than the rest of the city. At its end, parallel to the palace in the Civic Centre, sat the ''Bōjurlion'',<ref name="Map request" /> a massive arena.<ref>Concept artist Beth Elen Roberts, [https://www.bethelenroberts.com/houseofthedragon Old Valyria]</ref>

==History==
[[File:KOTNS King's Apartments Still.jpg|thumb|Model of Old Valyria.]]

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
King [[Viserys I Targaryen]] had a passion for Valyrian history, and assembled a scale model of Old Valyria in his solar out of stone miniatures crafted by masons based on the king's own research into historical records. According to Viserys I, the Valyrian capital city was built inside a volcano, similar to [[Dragonstone]]. Valyria's highest nobles lived in the buildings closest to the volcanic face, and the bloodmages worked inside a structure called the [[Anogrion]].<ref>"[[The Rogue Prince]]"</ref>

[[Stannis Baratheon]] mentions the colony of [[Stone Men]] dwelling in Valyria, where he was advised to send his daughter, [[Shireen Baratheon|Shireen]], when she was infected with [[greyscale]] as a child. However, he refused and instructed every single [[Order of Maesters|maester]] and healer he could find to save his daughter to spare her such a fate.<ref>"[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"</ref>

[[Jorah Mormont]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]] cross the ruins on their way to Meereen to see Daenerys. After a time contemplating the way the Valyrians, once the greatest civilization in the world, failed as a result of the Doom, they see [[Drogon]], one of the three remaining dragons flying over them, one of the last remnants of the once mighty Valyrian culture. They are then attacked by the Stone Men and, although Jorah manages to fight them off and save Tyrion, he is touched and infected with greyscale.<ref>"[[Kill the Boy]]"</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*According to the Season 5 Blu-ray commentary, the visual appearance of Valyria's ruins was inspired by the real-life ruins of [[Wikipedia:Angkor Wat|Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia. Actually, [[Gemma Jackson]] used a trip she made to Angkor Wat as the inspiration for the appearance of [[Harrenhal]] back in Season 2. Jackson left the show after Season 3 ended, though the general point she made seems to have stuck with the rest of the production team: people can be very surprised at just how quickly nature will reclaim ruined buildings and leave them overgrown with vegetation if they are left undisturbed by further human action. This principle would hold true for both a half-ruined castle complex in Westeros or a ruined city in Essos. Therefore, the ruins of Valyria have also become overgrown and subsumed by the jungle, to an even greater extent than Harrenhal.<ref>[http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/game-of-thrones/39270/game-of-thrones-season-5-what-we-learned-from-the-blu-rays Season 5 Blu-ray commentary]</ref>
*The scale model of Old Valyria created for ''[[House of the Dragon]]'' required two months to build, was eight meters long in its largest iteration, and consisted of over 200 pieces. The model expands in five stages over the course of Season 1 as Viserys I adds to it over the years. The model's structures were 3D-printed using PLA plastic and plaster, and some structures were so large that they had to be printed in pieces and then glued together. Each piece was coated with quick-dry cement and painted to give it the appearance of having been hand-carved out of pumice.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNhc5pIGpHI BTS: Model of Old Valyria | House of the Dragon (HBO)]</ref>

==In the books==
[[File:The Old Valyria alive.png|thumb|220x220px]]
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, this empire began its rise to power over five thousand years ago when the humble shepherd communities of Valyria found dragon lairs in nearby volcanoes, the Fourteen Flames. Finding a way of binding the dragons to their will, the Lords Freeholder of Valyria overran the neighboring empire of Ghis, throwing it down in defeat five times before annexing it fully. Eventually Valyria's empire stretched for thousands of miles along the coasts of Essos and far inland, expanding into the far western coastal regions where it overran the lands watered by the [[Rhoyne]] River (displacing the native [[Rhoynar]] people to Westeros, where they settled in [[Dorne]]) and annexed or established eight powerful colony-states. Refugees from these states founded the city of [[Braavos]] as a secret refuge from the Valyrians. The Valyrians also established a stronghold on the island of Dragonstone, possibly to facilitate trade with the then-independent Seven Kingdoms.

Valyria was utterly destroyed in a cataclysmic volcanic event known as the Doom approximately four centuries ago. The Fourteen Flames erupted simultaneously, while lava cracked and poured from hills. This event shattered the Valyrian peninsula, leaving it a storm-wracked chain of islands surrounded by boiling seas emitting poisonous fumes, and wiped out almost every dragon in the western world (bar only the dragons of the Targaryens on Dragonstone). In the aftermath of the Doom the eight colony-states threw off their Valyrian overlords and became the [[Free Cities]], eventually joining one another in trade and commerce links, along with the Secret City of Braavos to the far north. The Targaryens survived and launched a devastating invasion of Westeros almost three centuries ago, eventually uniting the entire continent under their control.

Another key remnant of the time of Valyria are artifacts, particularly weapons made of [[Valyrian steel]]. Weapons of Valyrian steel are incredibly sharp, never need maintenance and have unusual dark colors flowing along the blade. There are over 200 such weapons in Westeros, mostly serving as family heirlooms, such as the [[House Stark|Stark]] greatsword, [[Ice]], and the [[House Mormont|Mormont]] longsword, [[Longclaw]].

Author George R.R. Martin has stated that the Valyrian Freehold is essentially his medieval world's equivalent of the Roman Republic: a vast, now-fallen empire on such a grand scale and possessed of such advanced technologies (relative to their time) that peoples living in the dark age following its collapse view it as awesome and the stuff of legends. High Valyrian, their language, is treated as a lore-language essentially like Latin. Similarly, the Free Cities that are descended from Valyria's colonies and conquests are like medieval France, Italy, or Spain; their languages are stated to be "bastard Valyrian", in the process of mutating into separate languages akin to the Romance languages of our world (i.e. descended from High Valyrian just as French and Italian mutated and diverged from Latin). Unlike Rome, Valyria never turned into an empire even up to the time of the Doom, and was more similar to the earlier Roman Republic: a collection of powerful and wealthy aristocratic families (one of which were the Targaryens) jointly shared power.

According to the TV series official pronunciation guide developed for the cast and crew, "Valyria" is pronounced /vəˈlɪəɹ.i.ə/ — "Vuh-LEER-ee-uh", as opposed to "VAL-LEER-ee-uh".
