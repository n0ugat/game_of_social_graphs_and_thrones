The '''''Anogrion'''''{{Ref|HOTD102}} was a building in the Civic Centre<ref>Concept artist Beth Elen Roberts, [https://www.bethelenroberts.com/houseofthedragon Old Valyria]</ref> of [[Old Valyria]] that served as a place of work for [[Valyrians|Valyrian]] [[Bloodmagic|bloodmages]].

==History==
===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
The ''Anogrion'' is included in [[Viserys I Targaryen]]'s miniature of the Valyrian capital.{{Ref|HOTD102}}

==Behind the scenes==
Linguist [[David J. Peterson]] came up with the name "''anogrion''" as part of his expansion of the [[High Valyrian]] language. In his notes, he said that it means "temple" - though it is "an old word that derives from elder practices," so the literal etymology is "blood tower."<ref>[https://archiveofourown.org/works/41347620 David J. Peterson], Conlang Dialogue: House of the Dragon Episode 1.2</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, there is no mention of the term "''Anogrion''." Bloodmages were of very high standing in the [[Valyrian Freehold]], so it is not unlikely that they had their own center within the capital.
