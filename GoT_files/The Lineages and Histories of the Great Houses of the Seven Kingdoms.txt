'''''The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children'''''{{Ref|GOT104}} is a book detailing the history of the [[Great House]]s of the [[Seven Kingdoms]], including the lineage and appearance of all heirs, with illustrations of each house's individual sigil.

The book not only lists the lineages of the "Great Houses" which rule each of the Seven Kingdoms (such as [[House Baratheon]] and [[House Targaryen]]), but also other major noble houses such as [[House Umber]] and [[House Blackfyre]].

It is quite a ponderous tome; arranged as a chronicle instead of a narrative, it is primarily concerned with dates, marriages, and lines of descent. Persons mentioned in the book are also given brief physical descriptions (from surviving sources), along with important general facts about their lives and the manner of their deaths.<ref name="E4">"[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]"</ref>

==History==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
[[Jon Arryn]] asked [[Pycelle]] for the book shortly before his death. When hearing of his old mentor's interest in the tome, [[Eddard Stark]] borrows it from Pycelle as well.<ref name="E4"/>

Some time later, [[Varys]] mentions to [[Illyrio Mopatis]] that Lord Stark "has the book" and that events will unfold as expected, leading to war.<ref>"[[The Wolf and the Lion]]"</ref>

After [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] comments that [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]] has blonde hair and does not resemble Robert, Ned checks the ''Lineage and Histories'', and discovers that all members of [[House Baratheon]] are described as "black of hair", except for the "golden headed" Joffrey. This discovery, coupled with Robert's bastard son, the black-haired [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]], claiming that his mother was blonde, leads Ned to realize that Joffrey and his siblings are not Robert's biological children, and thus not his rightful heirs.<ref>"[[A Golden Crown]]"</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
Since the book first appears in "[[Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things]]", the information in it was created by [[Bryan Cogman]], who wrote that episode (though it later reappears in "[[A Golden Crown]]"). That is, the contents were not an invention of the art department: Cogman created all of the ''information'' in the prop book, then [[Jim Stanes]] physically copied what Cogman wrote into the prop itself, in medieval handwriting.

As Cogman explained, he created entries for four noble houses, two pages each, for a total of eight pages of content (the rest is just repeats of this or blank pages). The families were [[House Umber]], [[House Royce]], [[House Targaryen]], and [[House Baratheon]]. Ned Stark reads aloud from the Umber entry in episode 104, and from the Baratheon entry in 106. Bits of the Targaryen entry can be seen as Ned leafs through the book. Cogman explained that in the original draft of the episode there was "a bit from House Royce" as well, but it was cut, as was another scene with the Targaryen entry (by "a bit", he might have meant a point when Ned actually reads part of an entry aloud).

Cogman stated that he used as many reference sources as possible, searching through both the books and researching Westeros.org's ''A Wiki of Ice and Fire''. There are large gaps in the history of the story, however, for which Cogman simply had to make names up - i.e. it's possible that even George R.R. Martin has not currently planned out the ''entire'' lineage of House Umber from the Targaryen Conquest to the present, though the royal Targaryen lineage is better detailed in the books. For the minor names he had to make up, Cogman said he snuck in a few in-jokes using names derived from fan messageboards. He also said it was fun coming up with various diverse ways that minor characters had died.<ref>"[http://winteriscoming.net/2012/02/22/inside-the-creation-of-the-game-of-thrones-box-set-with-bryan-cogman/ Inside the creation of the Game of Thrones box set with Bryan Cogman]</ref>

The prop contains some errors, such as ascribing [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Viserys II)|Aemon the Dragonknight]] to House Blackfyre rather than House Targaryen, listing Steffon Baratheon's father as Lyonel Baratheon rather than [[Ormund Baratheon]] (who had not yet been introduced in the book series by the time Season 1 was filming), and giving Joffrey and Tommen Baratheon the same year of birth.

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, ''The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, With Descriptions of Many High Lords and Noble Ladies and Their Children'' is an old book written by Grand Maester Malleon. It doesn't mention the current Baratheons or Lannisters, but it mentions that throughout written history all Baratheons have been black-haired and that, likewise, every recorded union between Baratheon and Lannister has produced black-haired children.
