A '''red priestess''' is based in [[Meereen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
This woman is a [[red priest]]ess, the clergy of the [[Lord of Light]].{{Ref|GOT608}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|''Game of Thrones'': Season 6]]===
This red priestess is seen preaching on the streets of [[Meereen]] to a crowd of townspeople about [[Daenerys Targaryen]].{{Ref|GOT608}} Her presence (and the fact that she pointedly mentions Daenerys's advisers) is likely the result of the agreement between [[Kinvara]] and [[Tyrion Lannister]].{{Ref|GOT605}}

==Behind the scenes==
The red priestess's necklace, belt and chest piece clearly displays a motif of elongated hexagons, a shape associated with [[Asshai]] and featuring prominently in the wardrobes of the red priestess's fellow missionary, [[Melisandre]], the Asshai'i expatriate [[Quaithe]], and the red priestess's own superior, [[Kinvara]]. See "[[Costumes/Essos#Asshai|Costumes/Essos - Asshai]]".<ref>"A Man Without Honor" HBO featurette</ref> Interestingly, this red priestess's necklace is closer in shape to Melisandre's and Kinvara's, than to that of a different [[Red priestess (High Sparrow)|Volantene red priestess]], but her dress and chest piece are more similar to that priestess's than to the dresses of Kinvara and Melisandre.
