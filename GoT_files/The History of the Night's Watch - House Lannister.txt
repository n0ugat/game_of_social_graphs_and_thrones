==Narration==
'''Tywin Lannister''': ''Long ago, in the wintry [[North]], an army of [[White Walkers|demons]] emerged from beneath the icy ground and spread darkness and despair across the land. Astride their monstrous [[Ice spider|spiders]], flanked by [[giants]], they wreaked havoc on the innocent, slaughtering thousands.''

''All hope was lost until the fearless warriors of the first [[Night's Watch]] drove them back into the wintry mountains and built a [[Wall|magic wall]] to keep them from ever invading again. These stalwart Brothers in black continue to protect us even to this day from the evils that lurk in the shadows.''

''An absurd lie, a fairy tale, spun by many a wetnurse in the North. To be sure, a giant wall does exist - a triumph of engineering, perhaps, but not of "[[magic]]". As for the Night's Watch, there may have been a time, centuries ago, when there was prestige and honor in the miserable, monastic life of a Black Brother.''

''But now the Wall has become a glorified penal colony, full of outcasts, criminals and assorted ne’er-do-wells. Today, a typical man of the Night's Watch most likely started out a lowly beggar, or a rapist, or a village idiot. As for the few highborn watchmen, they either fought on the losing side of a war, or were disowned by their parents for one reason or another.''

''Those who persist in defending the Night's Watch will claim the [[Seven Kingdoms]] need protection from the [[Free Folk|wildling]] tribes of the Far North. But there's little to fear from those primitives. They’re a nuisance, but not sophisticated or powerful enough to be a significant threat to the realm. And any talk of "White Walkers" returning with their armies of the [[Wight|dead]] and their giant spiders and their [[Grumkins and snarks|snarks]], is just that: Talk.''
