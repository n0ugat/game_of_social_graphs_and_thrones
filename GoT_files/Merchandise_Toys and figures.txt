Toy sets and action figures.

==Diamond Select 7 Inch Figures==
[[File:Diamond Select HotD Wave 1.jpg|thumb|300px|Diamond Select Wave 1]]
On December 22, 2023, '''Diamond Select''' announced that they will be producing a new line of action figures for ''[[House of the Dragon]]'', at 1/6 scale (about 7 to 7.5 inches). Individual figure prices were announced as $30 each. While available for pre-order, the first set will not be released until Summer 2024, to tie-in with the premiere of ''House of the Dragon'' Season 2.<ref>[https://www.ign.com/articles/house-of-the-dragon-gets-first-action-figures-from-diamond-select-toys IGN,] Diamond Select HotD Toys Wave 1, 12/19/2023</ref>

Only two figures were announced so far: [[Daemon Targaryen]] and the elderly [[Viserys I Targaryen]]. The announcement did, however, refer to them as "Wave 1" - implying that they'll make more depending on the success of the first set.

==Funko==
===Funko POP!===
'''Funko Pop! Television Figurines''' are a series of 3.75 inch vinyl figurines based on characters from various TV series, including HBO's ''Game of Thrones''. They are not highly detailed or an attempt to be photo-realistic, but instead a cute cartoon version of characters, with oversized heads. While they are not as detailed as "action figures" or other figurines, by the same token they are cheaper to produce, so they come in a much greater variety than regular action figures. Many characters who have never appeared as photo-realistic action figures do have Pop! figurines modeled after them.

===Funko 6 Inch Action Figures===

The '''Funko Legacy Collection: Game of Thrones''' consists of detailed, well-sculpted, 6 inch scale figurines (short characters are smaller than this, while larger than average characters are slightly taller). Each figure's box is conveniently numbered.

'''Wave 1''' - released February 2014

*1 - [[Jon Snow]]
*2 - [[Tyrion Lannister]] - in [[Battle of the Blackwater]] armor, with battle-axe and [[Hand of the King]] chain of office.
*3 - [[Sandor Clegane|Sandor "The Hound" Clegane]]
*4 - A [[White Walkers|White Walker]]
*5 - [[Daenerys Targaryen]] - early Season 2 costume, including her three newly-hatched dragons, which can be mounted on her shoulder.
*6 - [[Eddard Stark|Ned Stark]]

'''Wave 2''' - released October 2014

*7 - [[Jaime Lannister]] (Season 1) in [[Kingsguard]] armor
*8 - [[Brienne of Tarth]] - in Season 2 armor

Funko ceased production on its ''Legacy Collection'' figures after 2014. While the figures were praised for their accuracy, this also led to some problems with fragility and a slower production rate.

===Funko 3.75 Inch Figures===

[[File:Ab0162c5779e6c7fd24825eb6fd74cc2.jpg|thumb|Funko 3.75 inches wave 1 figures]]
[[File:Index(2).jpeg|thumb|Funko Wall display with 3.75 Tyrion Figure]]

In April 2016 Funko re-launched its efforts at producing ''Game of Thrones'' action figures with a new series of 3.75 inch action figures. As with other 3.75 inch series, being smaller and less expensive will allow them to produce figures for a wider range of characters.<ref>[http://watchersonthewall.com/finn-jones-teases-that-loras-is-in-a-very-tricky-situation-next-season-maisie-williams-applauds-stunt-doubles-and-funko-reveals-new-got-figures/]</ref>

The first wave of figures in the 3.75 inch series include:

*[[Jon Snow]]
*[[Ygritte]] the wildling
*[[Ghost]] the direwolf
*[[Tormund]], wildling chieftain
*[[Samwell Tarly]] with bow
*The [[Lord of Bones]], wildling chieftain
*[[Styr]], wildling chieftain and Magnar of the [[Thenns]]
*A [[White Walkers|White Walker]]
*The [[Night King]]
*An "Attack the Wall" playset which includes a scale model of the top of the [[Wall]].
**A [[Tyrion Lannister]] figure that ships exclusively with the playset (Tyrion visited the Wall in Season 1).

==Dark Horse==
===Dark Horse 7 Inch Action Figures===
'''Dark Horse 7.5 inch figures''' based on ''Game of Thrones'' were first released in July 2014.<ref>[https://www.darkhorse.com/Search/Browse/%22thrones%22/PpwNwkt8 a series of action figures]</ref>

With the release of Brienne and Sandor figures in the Fall 2015 wave by Dark horse, every character that has a Funko ''Legacy Collection'' figure also has a figure produced by Dark Horse - and Dark Horse went beyond Funko's series to produce figures for characters that have no counterpart in the Funko series (including Cersei, Joffrey, Sansa, and more). In 2018, Wave 7 marked a re-release of existing characters in new attire. This included a redesign of the packaging.

'''Wave 1''' - Spring 2014:
*Ned Stark - in riding gear with fur cape
*Jon Snow
*Daenerys Targaryen - in wedding dress from Season 1 episode 1, with box containing dragon eggs
*Khal Drogo
*Tyrion Lannister

'''Wave 2''' - Summer/Fall 2014:
*Robb Stark (Season 2)
*Arya Stark (Season 2)
*Jaime Lannister (Season 1)
*[[Cersei Lannister]] (Season 2)
*A White Walker

'''Wave 3''' - Spring 2015:
*Tywin Lannister - in Season 3 costume
*Joffrey Baratheon - in formal wedding attire

*Varys
*[[Grey Worm]] - in standard [[Unsullied]] uniform, with removable helmet, shield, and longspear.
*[[Ygritte]] - in Season 4 attire (there is no snow cover south of the Wall yet so after crossing the wildlings worse their coats inside-out, as the brown color would camouflage them better than the white side). Includes her bow and arrow.
'''Wave 6 '''- Fall 2016:
*The [[Night King]]
*Stannis Baratheon
*Son of the Harpy
'''Wave 7 '''- Summer 2018:

===Dark Horse: other toys===
Dark Horse also made a varied range of other tie-in products for ''Game of Thrones'', such as glassware, pins, posts, map puzzles, etc.<ref>[https://www.darkhorse.com/Search/Browse/%22game+of+thrones%22/PpwNwkt8?page=1 Dark Horse website,] "Game of Thrones" section.</ref>

Notable is a recreation set of the map marker figures used in-universe by characters such as Tywin Lannister and Robb Stark during war planning scenes.<ref>[https://www.darkhorse.com/Products/27-541/Game-of-Thrones-Lannister-Map-Marker Dark Horse] Lannister map marker]</ref><ref>[https://www.darkhorse.com/Products/24-148/Game-of-Thrones-Map-Marker-Set-with-Map Dark Horse] full $200 map marker set</ref>

==McFarlane Toys==
===''House of the Dragon''===

By late 2023, McFarlane Toys launched "Wave 1" in a series of deluxe sculpts of the Targaryen dragons in the ''House of the Dragon'' prequel series. They are at roughly the scale of 12 by 6 by 8 inches, and are available through the HBO online store. 

Wave 1 only consisted of two deluxe figures:

*Syrax
*Caraxes

===''Game of Thrones'': Season 8===

McFarlane put out a single set of 6 inch action figures based on ''Game of Thrones'': Season 8. There were only four figures and the series was not continued:

*Jon Snow
*Daenaerys Targaryen
*Night King
*Arya Stark
**"Arya Stark - Fall of King's Landing" - the same sculpt as the regular figure, but sprinkled with paint to resemble how Arya was covered in ash when King's Landing burned.

Tied in with these human characters, McFarlane also put out 8 inch tall replicas of Daenaerys's three dragons (repaints of the same model, though because the three dragons within the show use the same model). 

===Construction set===

In 2015 McFarlane Toys released several sets of construction toys, with bricks similar to Legos, but which when finished have photo-realistic detail. The set also included realistic figures in a 2 inch scale.<ref>[https://mcfarlane.com/news/game-of-thrones-construction-sets-in-stores/ McFarlane,] construction set</ref>

The sets released:
* The Iron Throne Room, which included the [[Iron Throne]], [[Joffrey Baratheon]], and a [[Kingsguard]]
* The Lannister Banner pack, with two Lannister soldiers
* The Stark banner Pack, with two Stark soldiers

12 different "blind bags" with the following figures: [[Jon Snow]], [[Ghost]], [[Daenerys Targaryen]], [[Rhaegal]], [[Tyrion Lannister]], [[Grey Worm]], [[Kingsguard]], [[Free Folk|Wildling]] with axe, [[Free Folk|Wildling]] with spear, [[Wight]] with sword, [[Unsullied]] attacking, and a Man of the [[Night's Watch]] defending.

Two extra set were announced but never released in stores:
* Mother of Dragons
* Attack on the Wall

==Eaglemoss Tabletop Minifigures==
In 2016 '''Eaglemoss''' released its HBO Official ''Game of Thrones'' collectors models detailing key characters in pivotal moments from the TV series. These tabletop minifigures are at 1/21 scale (6 cm, or 2.4 inches).<ref>[http://gameofthrones.eaglemoss.com Game of Thrones Collection Eaglemoss] </ref>

The initial subscribers list of models (Nov 2015) differs from the official retail release schedule (second quarter 2016). The list here is of models that have been released via the official 2016 schedule. Each model comes with its own unique magazine detailing the characters and the moments the characters have in the show relating to the model. As of January 2018 (issue 50) the figures switched from a biweekly to monthly release, and end with issue 60.
