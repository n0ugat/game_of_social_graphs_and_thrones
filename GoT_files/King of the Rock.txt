{{Quote|The Lannisters reigned as Kings of the Rock for thousands of years... and worked to make it the envy of the rest of the Seven Kingdoms.|[[Tywin Lannister]]|House Lannister (short)}}
The '''King of the Rock'''{{Ref|H&L123}} ruled the [[Westerlands]], then a sovereign state known as the [[Westerlands|Kingdom of the Rock]], prior to [[Aegon's Conquest]] of [[Westeros]]. The title was traditionally held by the head of [[House Lannister]]. The last King of the Rock was [[Loren I Lannister]], who submitted to Aegon the Conqueror after the [[Field of Fire]] and became the first [[Warden of the West]].

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the King of the Rock was the title of the rulers of the Westerlands until House Lannister bent the knee to House Targaryen. The Lannisters were not kings from the start, when [[Lann the Clever]] (according to legend) took Casterly Rock from House Casterly. They declared themselves kings many generations later, after they had grown in wealth and influence (but still before the coming of the Andals).

===Known Kings of the Rock before the coming of the Andals===
*Loreon I Lannister "Loreon the Lion" - the first King of the Rock
*Cerion Lannister - won a great battle at Golden Tooth against three rival kings
*Tommen I Lannister - conquered [[Fair Isle]]
*Loreon II Lannister
*Lancel I Lannister "Lancel the Lion" - conquered south to Old Oak (which is now in the north of the Reach)
*Loreon III Lannister "Loreon the Limp"
*Gerold I Lannister "Gerold the Great" - successfully attacked the Iron Islands and took many hostages
*Lancel IV Lannister - died at Red Lake
*Lancel V Lannister - tried to invade the Reach while the Gardener armies were away in the east invading the Stormlands, but was killed by Wilbert Osgrey and his army repulsed.
*Norwin Lannister - notoriously miserly and ungenerous
*Loreon IV Lannister "Loreon the Lackwit" - an insane lackwit
*Loreon V Lannister - often dressed as a woman and hung around the docks. Called "Queen Loria" by his detractors. The name "Loreon" was rarely used by Lannisters after Loreon IV and Loreon V.
*Tyrion II Lannister "The Tormentor" - sadistically tortured women.
*Tybolt Lannister "Thunderbolt" - turned back the first wave of Andal invaders coming from the east, inflicting heavy losses on them. The [[coming of the Andals]] occurred roughly 6,000 years ago but lasted several generations.
*Tyrion III Lannister
*Gerold II Lannister - Tyrion III and Gerold II were being worn down slowly by wave after wave of Andals over the years, and seeing that total resistance was doomed to failure, decided to make alliances with different Andals to preserve their family and lands as best they could. Both Tyrion III and Gerold II married Andal wives, awarded lands to other Andals, and exchanged wards with others. Afterwards the Lannisters and the Westerlands became dominated by Andal culture.

===Known Kings of the Rock after the coming of the Andals===
*Tommen II Lannister - lost at sea while sailing to Valyria
*Loren I Lannister "Loren the Last" - defeated by the Targaryen dragons at the [[Field of Fire]], subsequently bent the knee to Aegon the Conqueror and became the first Warden of the West.
