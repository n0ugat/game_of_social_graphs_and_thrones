==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
He is one of the many [[Slavery|slaves]] that gather over the walls of [[Meereen]] when [[Daenerys Targaryen]] and her army appear before the city gates to lay [[Siege of Meereen|siege]] to the city. After the death of Meereenese champion [[Oznak zo Pahl]] and Daenerys' words to the slaves present, he watches as a slave picks up one of the hundreds of broken slave collars thrown into the city in catapulted barrels. He then picks up the collar that belonged to a former slave and glances at his master.{{Ref|GOT403}}
