{{Quote|I want my child to be born where I was born, on Driftmark, in my lord father's castle. I want my daughters to be raised in their homeland with their family according to their birthright. And at my end, I want to die a dragonrider's death. Not that of some fat country lord.|Laena Velaryon|The Princess and the Queen}}
Lady '''Laena Velaryon'''{{Note|[[High Valyrian]]: ''Laena Velarion''}} was the daughter and second-born child of [[Corlys Velaryon]] and [[Rhaenys Targaryen]], the younger sister of [[Laenor Velaryon]] and the second wife of [[Daemon Targaryen]].<ref>[https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-releases-first-official-teaser-house-dragon HBO Releases First Official Teaser For HOUSE OF THE DRAGON]</ref> She was the [[Dragonrider|rider]] of the [[dragon]] [[Vhagar]],{{Ref|HOTD106}} and the mother of [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Laena's mother, [[Rhaenys Targaryen]], was passed over as heir to the [[Iron Throne]] due to her sex when the assembled lords of Westeros at the [[Great Council at Harrenhal]] instead voted that Rhaenys's cousin [[Viserys I Targaryen|Viserys]] should be the heir.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 1|''House of the Dragon'': Season 1]]===
Laena attends the [[Heir's Tournament]] with her family. When the combatants break into brutish violence, she is visibly distressed, clutching her older brother [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]]'s arm.{{Ref|HOTD101}}

Five months following Queen [[Aemma Arryn]]'s death, Laena is proposed by her parents as a marriage candidate for King [[Viserys I Targaryen]]. They arrange a meeting between Laena and Viserys, during which the young lady asks the king about the dragons [[Balerion]] and [[Vhagar]]. She also admits to the king that her mother told her, should he marry her, Laena wouldn't have to bed the king until she turned fourteen. Despite the political advantages of the proposed marriage, Viserys rejects the match on account of Laena's age, and decides to marry [[Alicent Hightower]].{{Ref|HOTD102}}

Laena claims Vhagar in [[115 AC]].{{Ref|HOTD106}}

In [[116 AC]],{{Dateref|King of the Narrow Sea}} Lord Corlys returns to Driftmark from the [[War for the Stepstones]], and begins negotiations to betroth Laena to the son of the [[Sealord of Braavos]]. An alliance between House Velaryon and one of the [[Free Cities]] is viewed as deeply troubling by the [[Small Council]].{{Ref|HOTD104}}

Due to this King Viserys begins to negotiate for a marriage pact with House Velaryon. Laena politely welcomes the King and his retinue at [[High Tide]], she happily departs with her cousin Rhaenyra for breakfast.{{Ref|HOTD105}}
[[File:TPATQ Laena & Daemon.png|thumb|Laena riding [[Vhagar]] in Pentos. ]]
Laena never fulfills her marriage pact to the [[Sealord of Braavos|Sealord]]'s son; soon after the beginning of the negotiations, Laena dances with [[Daemon Targaryen]] at the wedding of [[Rhaenyra Targaryen]] and Laena's brother, Laenor,{{Ref|HOTD105}} and the two are eventually married.{{Ref|HOTD106}}

In [[126 AC]],{{Dateref|The Princess and the Queen}} ten years after Rhaenyra and Laenor's wedding, Laena and Daemon reside in [[Pentos]] and live there for some time alongside their two daughters, [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] and [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]]. Laena suffers from complications during her third pregnancy. After Daemon is informed that it would perhaps be possible to save the baby through the use of a caesarean section, Laena resolves to die a dragonrider's death, walking to Vhagar and commanding the dragon to incinerate her. Vhagar reluctantly complies, burning Laena alive in front of Daemon.{{Ref|HOTD106}} Laena is buried at [[High Tide]] according to the customs of House Velaryon, her sarcophagus being dropped into the sea. Her eulogy is delivered by her uncle [[Vaemond Velaryon]].{{Ref|HOTD107}}

Later that night, her mother suggests to her father that Driftmark should pass through Laena's line. Lord Corlys rejects this suggestion.{{Ref|HOTD107}}

[[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]] tries to sway Rhaenys into supporting the [[Greens]], by pointing out the losses [[House Velaryon]] suffered due to their alignment to the [[Blacks]], referring to, amongst other things, Laena's death away from her [[Driftmark|home]]. Alicent offers to let pass Driftmark through Laena's daughters.{{Ref|HOTD109}}

After Laena's father awakens from recovering wounds taken in the [[Stepstones]], his wife Rhaenys accuses him of having abandoned their family. Corlys admits this, insisting that adventuring was a coping mechanism to deal with the deaths of their children, including Laena's death.{{Ref|HOTD110}}

===[[House of the Dragon: Season 2|''House of the Dragon'': Season 2]]===
Laena's death is recalled by her [[Rhaenys Targaryen|mother]], as Rhaenys tries to make Daemon understand the grieving process of a mother.{{Ref|HOTD201}}

At Harrenhal, Laena suddenly appears to her husband Daemon; she's dressed in the same outfit as when she died and was pregnant. She serves him wine, looks at him but says nothing.{{Ref|HOTD204}} In the following days, she appears to him a second time, approaches him, tells him that a terrible war is raging in the [[Riverlands]]. She asks him if he has looked after their daughters.{{Ref|HOTD205}}

==Behind the scenes==
On October 5, 2021, [[HBO]] announced that [[Savannah Steyn]] had been cast in the role of Laena Velaryon for ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. Her character description reads as follows:

:''"Daughter of Corlys Velaryon and Rhaenys Targaryen."''{{Webref|name=WBD |author=Unknown author |date= Unknown date|url=https://press.wbd.com/us/bio/house-dragon-character-descriptions |title=House of the Dragon S1 <nowiki>|</nowiki> Character Descriptions |website=Warner Bros. Discovery |access-date=April 25, 2023 }}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Laena was born in 92 AC. She inherited her mother's beauty and her father's bold, adventurous spirit. She loved to fly; before the age of twelve she claimed Vhagar, the oldest and largest of the Targaryen dragons since the passing of the Black Dread.

Laena's family schemed to advance her in a marriage alliance, but she herself was disinterested in politics, and more interested in flying. Nonetheless she was considered a great feminine beauty and admired at court.

Laena was betrothed from the age of twelve to a son of the current [[Sealord of Braavos]], but the father died before they could be wed, and the son turned to be a wastrel fool. 

When Daemon came to Driftmark, he met Laena, who was 22 years old, tall, slender, and surpassingly lovely, with a great mane of silver-gold ringlets that fell downpast her waist. Daemon fell in love with Laena (some people believe he saw Laena as a means to further his ambition), and asked Corlys for her hand in marriage. Daemon taunted Laena's fiancé, and the latter foolishly challenged him. Daemon easily killed his opponent and wed Laena in 115 AC. 

Since Daemon knew his brother would be displeased with his marriage, they moved to Pentos. A year later, Laena gave birth to twin daughters, Baela and Rhaena. When the babies were half a year old, Laena sailed with them to Driftmark.

When Laena was 27 years old, she gave birth to a third child, but the baby was twisted and malformed, and died within the hour; Laena died three days afterwards. During her final hour, it is said she rose from her bed, intending to reach Vhagar for flying one last time. She collapsed and died, however, before she could reach the dragon.

The deaths of Laena and her third child were the first two of the multiple tragic events which occurred in 120 AC, known as [[Year of the Red Spring]].
