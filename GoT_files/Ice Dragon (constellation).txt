==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Ice Dragon is a constellation of stars in the skies of [[Westeros]]. Its blue eye points north and its tail leads south.

[[Bran Stark]] and his companion often follow the eye Ice Dragon to find their way after getting lost on the way to the [[Wall]], a direction given by [[Osha]]. [[Samwell Tarly]] and [[Gilly]] follow the tail as they travel to the Wall from [[Craster's Keep]].

The night before the [[Free Folk|wildlings]] climb the Wall, [[Jon Snow]] searches for [[Ghost]] and looks to the stars. He thinks that he is old friends with the Ice Dragon, remembering stories that [[Old Nan]] told him as a child.
