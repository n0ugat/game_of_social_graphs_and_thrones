The '''submission of Stokeworth''' was an event of the [[Dance of the Dragons]], part of Ser [[Criston Cole]]'s campaign in the [[Crownlands]] in [[132 AC]].{{Dateref|House of the Dragon: Season 2}} It ended in [[House Stokeworth]] declaring for the [[Greens]] and adding their forces to Cole's army.

==History==
===Prelude===
[[File:Cole's army departing KL.png|thumb|Cole's army starting his campaign in the Crownlands.]]
After Ser [[Criston Cole]] is named [[Hand of the King]] by King [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon II]], he assembles a [[Greens|Targaryen]]-[[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightower]] army in [[King's Landing]] and marches north on the [[Rosby Road]], with the objective of forcing the submission of all the noble houses of the [[Crownlands]] to the Greens' cause. During their march to [[Rosby]], Criston's army is harassed by Lady [[Baela Targaryen]] atop [[Moondancer]]. Subsequently, Criston began marching his army solely at night to exploit the treecover and mask his movements from the [[Blacks]].{{Ref|HOTD203}}

During the inital part of this campaign, [[House Rosby]] willing submitted to the Greens, offering their forces to join Criston's army. Following this, the Green army marched for [[Castle Stokeworth]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}

===Submission===
Upon the Green army's arrival at Castle Stokeworth, [[House Stokeworth]], like House Rosby, submits to Criston without siege, raising King Aegon II's banner, and contributing levies to the Green host.{{Ref|HOTD204}}

===Aftermath===
With the forces of Houses Rosby and Stokeworth added to the Green army, Criston and his forces marched north for [[Duskendale]]. There, they would meet the first challenge to their campaign in a defiant [[House Darklyn]], leading to the [[sack of Duskendale]].{{Ref|HOTD204}}

==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', House Stokeworth declared [[Blacks|Black]] at first, but switched sides when Criston's host arrived at their castle.
