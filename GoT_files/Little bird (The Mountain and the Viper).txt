{{Quote|Ser Barristan.|Little bird|The Mountain and the Viper}}
A "'''little bird'''" is part of [[Varys]]'s intercontinental network of informants and spies, whom he refers to as "[[little birds]]".

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|''Game of Thrones'': Season 4]]===
He delivers a message to [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Barristan Selmy]], who discovers it to be a royal pardon addressed to Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] and signed by King [[Robert Baratheon]]. This leads him to the realization that Jorah has been reporting [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s actions to Varys. When confronted with this revelation, Jorah asks Barristan who brought him the pardon but Barristan doesn't tell him.{{Ref|GOT408}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Varys is known for employing orphans and urchins as his "little birds". However, Jorah's treachery is revealed in a different manner. After saving Daenerys from the [[manticore]], Barristan comes into her service as Arstan Whitebeard in order to observe her and make sure that she has not inherited [[Aerys II Targaryen|her father]]'s [[Targaryen madness|madness]]. After saving Daenerys from [[Mero]], Jorah recognizes him and reveals his true identity. In return, Barristan reveals Jorah's treachery, which he knew about from attending meetings of the [[Small Council]].

In the TV series, Barristan explains to Jorah in "[[Kissed by Fire]]" that Robert never trusted him to do anything more than protect him, hence Barristan was barred from [[Small Council]] meetings, though the Lord Commander is usually the Small Council's military attaché. Hence, he had no knowledge of Jorah's treachery prior to reading the message from the little bird.
