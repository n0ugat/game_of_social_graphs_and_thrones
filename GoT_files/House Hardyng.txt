==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, House Hardyng is a house of landed knights sworn to House Waynwood. By the fourth book, [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]] suggests marrying Harrold Hardyng to [[Sansa Stark|Sansa]] (masquerading as Littlefinger's bastard daughter "Alayne Stone"). Harrold is [[House Arryn]]'s heir due to the uncertain health of [[Robin Arryn]] (called Robert in the books). It is implied Littlefinger will "help" Robert die, making Harrold the new Lord of the Vale, which would also make Sansa Lady of the Vale by marriage.{{Bookref|AFFC|41}}
