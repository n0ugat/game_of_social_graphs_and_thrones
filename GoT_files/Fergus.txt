{{Quote|My lord, we're not soldiers.|Fergus to [[Davos Seaworth]]|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)}}
'''Fergus''' was a commoner at [[Winterfell]].

==Biography==
===Background===
Fergus is a [[smallfolk|commoner]] conscripted to defend [[Winterfell]] from the approaching [[Wight|army of the dead]].{{Ref|GOT802}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 8|''Game of Thrones'': Season 8]]===
During a community kitchen, Fergus, while receiving soup from Ser [[Davos Seaworth]], complains about the conscription of the smallfolk, stating that they aren't soldiers. Davos reassures him by recounting his own experience, stating that if he survived the [[Battle of the Bastards]] despite never having been in a battle for most of his life, he can survive this one. He then directs him to the quartermaster. He later dons chainmail and joins the archers at the battlements.{{Ref|GOT802}} Fergus is killed by the [[Night King]]'s forces during the [[Battle of Winterfell]].<ref name="Reddit"/>

==Behind the scenes==
Fergus is portrayed by [[Seamus O'Hara]].<ref>"Who are the new Game of Thrones characters joining Season 8?" - https://metro.co.uk/2018/07/21/new-game-thrones-characters-joining-season-8-7743512/</ref>

His death scene was cut from the show due to scheduling issues. According to O'Hara, Fergus was originally supposed to be on Winterfell's ramparts with a bow, encouraged to fight by [[Arya Stark|Arya]] and Davos. After fighting bravely, he would be dragged over the wall by wights and fall to his death.<ref name="Reddit" />
