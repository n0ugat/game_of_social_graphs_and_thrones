The '''Thirteen''',{{Ref|GOT204}} also known as the '''Elders of Qarth''',{{Ref|GOT204}} are the ruling council of the city-state of [[Qarth]].

==History==
===Background===
Most of its members hail from the [[Pureborn]], descendants of the deposed [[King of Qarth|Kings of Qarth]], who hold hereditary seats and possess a majority of members. The [[Warlocks]] of Qarth also hold a single permanent seat, occupied by an envoy of their order. The rest of the seats are occupied by [[merchant]]s invited by the council, and remain there for as long as they are powerful and feared enough not to be dismissed or replaced by another candidate. Because of this, the members of the Thirteen pay attention not only to amassing wealth, but specially to appear wealthy.<ref>"[[Qarth (short)|Qarth]]"</ref>

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|''Game of Thrones'': Season 2]]===
The Thirteen open the gates of Qarth to see for themselves [[Daenerys Targaryen]]'s three [[dragon]]s but turn her away when she tries to enter the city, fearing that her [[Dothraki]] may attempt to plunder the city. [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos]], however, invokes [[Sumai]], a blood oath in which a Qartheen vouches for outsiders that wish to enter the city.<ref>"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref>

Xaro Xhoan Daxos orchestrates the elimination of his fellow council members with the aid of the [[Warlocks|warlock]] [[Pyat Pree]] as part of his plan to crown himself [[King of Qarth]].<ref>"[[A Man Without Honor]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the Thirteen are not the ruling oligarchy of Qarth but a powerful merchant guild that competes with the "Tourmaline Brotherhood" and the "Ancient Guild of Spicers" (upon which the [[Spice King]] is apparently based) for supremacy over the city. Meanwhile, the rulers of Qarth are the "Pureborn" or "Enthroned", a group of aristocrats that descend from the ancient kings and queens of Qarth. These three large merchant guilds compete with the Pureborn and with each other for power in Qarth. Pyat Pree, as a warlock, is not a member of the Thirteen. The TV series condensed all of these into one group.
