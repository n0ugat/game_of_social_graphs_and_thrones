{{Quote|I'm the First Ranger. My job is [[Beyond the Wall|out there]].|[[Benjen Stark]]|Lord Snow}}
The '''First Ranger'''{{Ref|GOT103}} is a high position held in the [[Night's Watch]], the group responsible for defending the [[Wall]], and tasked with ranging beyond it. He is the leader of the rangers, only answering to the [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]].

[[Benjen Stark]] was First Ranger under Lord Commander [[Jeor Mormont]], but he went missing on a scouting mission beyond the Wall and never returned.<ref>"[[You Win or You Die]]"</ref> The office was left vacant for some time during the [[great ranging]], and due to the subsequent death of Mormont.

After the [[battle for the Wall]], the Night's Watch had enough of a respite to hold an [[Elections#Night's Watch|election]] in which [[Jon Snow]] was then chosen as the new Lord Commander. Jon then appointed Ser [[Alliser Thorne]] as the new First Ranger, in recognition of his long experience and his valor in the battle.<ref>"[[High Sparrow (episode)|High Sparrow]]"</ref>
