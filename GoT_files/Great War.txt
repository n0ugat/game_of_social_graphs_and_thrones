{{Quote|There is only one war that matters. The Great War. And it is here.|Jon Snow at the Dragonpit Summit|The Dragon and the Wolf}}
The '''Great War'''{{Ref|GOT707}} was the ultimate culmination of the long-simmering [[conflict beyond the Wall]]: the war between the living and the dead. It was the second war waged by the [[White Walkers]] against humanity, the first having occurred thousands of years ago during the first [[Long Night]] in the form of the [[Long Night#The War for the Dawn|War for the Dawn]].

The opening stages of the Great War are a war of attrition between the [[Night King]], his legions of White Walkers, and their [[Wight|Army of the Dead]] against the living peoples of [[Westeros]]. They were opposed by the [[Night's Watch]], the [[North]], the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], the [[Free Folk]], and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]], all under the leadership of [[Jon Snow]], the [[Warden of the North]]. Jon is later joined by [[Daenerys Targaryen]], who leads the forces of [[House Targaryen]] with her [[Hand of the King|hand]], [[Tyrion Lannister]]. [[Jaime Lannister]] also abandons his sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] to travel north to [[Winterfell]] to join the military forces of the North after she reveals her intentions to Jaime to hold back the southern armies.

Although expected to threaten all of Westeros and possibly [[Known world|the world]], the Great War at its beginning is centered on the North, as the southern [[Seven Kingdoms|kingdoms]] are in disbelief of the White Walkers and are more preoccupied with the aftermath of the [[War of the Five Kings]] and the [[Last War]], another long-awaited conflict which began around the same time the North began preparations for the coming Great War.

The alliance of the living led by the [[Great House]]s of [[House Stark|Stark]], Targaryen, and [[House Arryn|Arryn]] face off against the army of the dead in the [[Battle of Winterfell]]. Although the living suffer heavy casualties and many are risen again as wights, the Night King is drawn out by [[Bran Stark]], the new [[Three-Eyed Raven]], and destroyed by his sister [[Arya Stark|Arya]], causing all of the White Walkers to shatter and the wights to fall and ending the Long Night before it can truly begin again.

==History==
===Prelude===
{{Quote|Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling Houses. It's between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady: the dead are coming.|[[Davos Seaworth]] to [[Lyanna Mormont]]|The Broken Man}}''See main articles: [[Long Night]] and [[Conflict beyond the Wall]]''
The [[White Walkers]] first descended upon [[Westeros]] during the [[Age of Heroes]] 8,000 years ago, bringing with them a cold and terrible winter and a dark [[Long Night|night that lasted a generation]]. The [[Night King]] had been created thousands of years prior by the [[Children of the Forest]], the natives of Westeros, with [[dragonglass]] to [[War of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|combat]] the invading [[First Men]] in the [[Dawn Age]], but the Children and the First Men came together in [[Long Night#The War for the Dawn|War for the Dawn]] to fight against their common enemy. The White Walkers and their [[wight]]s, which had been raised from those that they slaughtered, were defeated and driven back to the [[Land of Always Winter|far north]] while the [[Wall]] was raised and the [[Night's Watch]] formed to prevent the White Walkers from returning. Many were trapped [[beyond the Wall|north of the Wall]], becoming the [[Free Folk]], while those south of the Wall began to form kingdoms.

As the many centuries passed, most of Westeros came to see the [[magic]]al White Walkers and Children of the Forest as nothing more than legends and scary fairy tales, especially as the [[Andals]] and the [[Rhoynar]] had never encountered them on Westeros since their migrations came thousands of years after the Long Night. However, the White Walkers eventually rose from the ice again beyond the Wall around the time of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. While the southern [[Seven Kingdoms]] were preoccupied with their own [[War of the Five Kings|civil war]] and largely did not believe in the White Walkers, the Free Folk, who were being slaughtered by the White Walkers to amass a new army of the dead, were attempting to cross the Wall while the Night's Watch was seeking out the truth and fighting against their old wildling enemies in the [[conflict beyond the Wall]].<ref name="S1">"[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|Season 1]]"</ref><ref name="S2">"[[Game of Thrones: Season 2|Season 2]]"</ref><ref name="S3">"[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|Season 3]]"</ref><ref name="S4">"[[Game of Thrones: Season 4|Season 4]]"</ref>

However, the Night's Watch, under [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jon Snow]], let the wildlings cross the Wall after realizing the existence of the White Walkers and the threat that they posed. They come south of the Wall after the attempted rescue [[Massacre at Hardhome|mission]] at [[Hardhome]]. This decision led to a [[Mutiny at Castle Black|mutiny]] but Jon was resurrected and freed from his life long vows to the Night's Watch. Seeking to unite the [[North]] against the White Walkers, Jon, himself the alleged [[Bastard|illegitimate]] son of [[Eddard Stark]], joined with his half-sister [[Sansa Stark]] to save their younger brother [[Rickon Stark]] and reclaim their home Winterfell from [[House Bolton]], who had previously usurped House Stark from the North after the [[Red Wedding]]. [[Ramsay Bolton]] and his allies were defeated and killed at the [[Battle of the Bastards]], and in the aftermath of the battle, Sansa became the new [[Lord of Winterfell|Lady of Winterfell]] while Jon was declared the [[King in the North]] by the lords of the North and the [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] at Winterfell. Around the same time, [[Daenerys Targaryen]], the only known survivor of the once royal [[House Targaryen]] which had been ousted during Robert's Rebellion, begun setting sail for [[Dragonstone]] with her allies, [[Noble house|vassals]], and three [[dragon]]s, the first born in [[Known world|the world]] in over a century. At this time, [[Bran Stark]] discovered via the [[Sight]] that Jon, unbeknownst to all including Jon himself, is of both Stark ''and'' Targaryen lineage as the secret son of [[Lyanna Stark]], [[Eddard Stark]]'s sister, and [[Rhaegar Targaryen]], Daenerys's eldest brother, both of whom died in Robert's Rebellion.<ref name="S5">"[[Game of Thrones: Season 5|Season 5]]"</ref><ref name="S6">"[[Game of Thrones: Season 6|Season 6]]"</ref>

{{Quote|If we don't put aside our enmities and band together we will die. And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.|[[Davos Seaworth]] to [[Daenerys Targaryen]]|The Queen's Justice}}After being crowned [[King in the North]], [[Jon Snow]] begins formulating a plan to defend the [[Seven Kingdoms|realm]] from the [[Wight|Army of the Dead]]. He decrees that everyone in the [[North]] - men, women, and children above 10 years of age - need to be formally trained in combat to defend themselves from the dead, and orders the gathered [[Lordship|lords]] to have their [[Order of Maesters|maesters]] search for [[dragonglass]], one of the only two known substances lethal to both [[White Walkers]] and [[wight]]s. Meanwhile, thousands of miles away in [[Oldtown]], [[Samwell Tarly]], a brother of the [[Night's Watch]] and another veteran of the [[conflict beyond the Wall]], scours the library at the [[Citadel]] for information that can be used to defeat the White Walkers and their army of the dead. His best lead is the discovery that enormous amounts of dragonglass can be found on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]].<ref name="E61">"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

[[Melisandre]] meets [[Daenerys Targaryen]] at Dragonstone, who has begun planning the [[Last War]] to take back the [[Iron Throne]] from [[Cersei Lannister]], who seized the crown after the [[Destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor|extinction]] of the [[House Baratheon of King's Landing|Baratheon dynasty]] that had been formed at the end of [[Robert's Rebellion]]. She urges Daenerys to summon Jon Snow to Dragonstone, believing that they both have a role to play in the Great War for the dawn, later referring to them as "ice and fire" to [[Varys]]. [[Tyrion Lannister]], Daenerys's [[Hand of the King|Hand]], informs Daenerys that he met and trusts Jon and that the North could make a valuable ally, and Daenerys agrees. They eventually meet at Dragonstone as Jon and [[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Davos Seaworth]] are brought to the throne room. Jon refuses to [[Bending the knee|bend the knee]] but attempts to persuade her of the existence of the White Walkers and the realness of their threat. Daenerys and Tyrion are skeptical, but she lets him stay as a "guest" at Dragonstone. Later, Tyrion and Jon discuss the army of the dead, and Tyrion, despite his skepticism, trusts Jon and persuades Daenerys to allow Jon to mine the dragonglass. Tyrion explains that if Jon is wrong - the dragonglass is worthless, and Daenerys does not need it anyway (she did not even know it was there in the first place, so it is nothing to her); allowing Jon to mine it may result in an alliance.<ref name="E62">"[[Stormborn]]"</ref><ref name="E63">"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref>

Before beginning the mining operations, Jon leads Daenerys down to the caves where he shows her the dragonglass. He leads her further, revealing carvings that he explains were engraved by the [[Children of the Forest]]. Daenerys wonders if they were made before the coming of the [[First Men]] to [[Westeros]], but Jon shows her the Children's depictions of the Children and the First Men, despite their [[War of the First Men and the Children of the Forest|conflict]], fighting together against a common enemy: the [[Night King]] and his White Walkers. Daenerys, her trust in Jon growing, agrees to fight for the North... when Jon bends the knee. Jon tells her that his [[Noble house|bannermen]] will not accept another southern ruler, but Daenerys is confident that his [[Northmen|people]] will follow him.<ref name="E64">"[[The Spoils of War]]"</ref>

In the Chamber of the [[Painted Table]], Jon receives a [[raven]] from his half-brother [[Bran Stark]], a [[warg]] who had been trained in the [[Sight]] by [[Brynden Rivers]], revealing that he and [[Arya Stark]] are alive and at [[Winterfell]], yet also warning that the Night King is on the march to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]]. Tyrion proposes that the best way to prove the army of the dead to Cersei Lannister and Westeros is to capture a wight. Jon travels to Eastwatch with Ser [[Jorah Mormont]] of Daenerys's [[Kingsguard|Queensguard]], Ser Davos, and [[Gendry Baratheon|Gendry]] where they meet with [[Tormund]] as well as three prominent brothers of the [[Brotherhood Without Banners]]: Lord [[Beric Dondarrion]], [[Thoros]] of [[Myr]], and [[Sandor Clegane]]. Despite their differences from the past, they all agree to march [[beyond the Wall]] with Jon on his [[wight hunt]].<ref name="E65">"[[Eastwatch]]"</ref> Beyond the [[Wall]], the group is able to come together and put aside their differences through conversation while marching. They succeed in [[Captured wight|capturing a wight]] despite being attacked by a wight [[snow bear]] earlier but draw the attention of a large contingent of the army of the dead, forcing them onto an island in the middle of a frozen lake. Gendry runs back to Eastwatch, where he has Ser Davos send a raven to Dragonstone asking for Daenerys's help. Though Tyrion advises that she stay behind out of concern for her safety and their cause, Daenerys flies to the far north with her three [[dragon]]s, [[Drogon]], [[Rhaegal]], and [[Viserion]], and saves the surviving members of Jon's group. However, the Night King is able to kill Viserion, and Jon is left behind when two wights drag him beneath the frozen lake. Nonetheless, Jon escapes and is later saved by his long lost uncle, [[Benjen Stark]], who sacrifices himself to allow Jon to flee back to Eastwatch. On a [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]] [[Ships|ship]] en route to [[King's Landing]] for a [[parley]], Jon privately pledges his loyalty to Daenerys Targaryen while beyond the Wall, the Night King reanimates the corpse of Viserion.<ref name="E66">"[[Beyond the Wall (episode)|Beyond the Wall]]"</ref>

[[File:BREACHED WALL1.png|thumb|The Wall is breached by the White Walkers.]]
At the [[Dragonpit Summit]] atop Rhaenys's Hill, Jon Snow presents the captured wight to the gathered attendants: Cersei Lannister, [[Euron Greyjoy]], and their entourage. Jon warns them that only one war matters now: the Great War. However, things turn sour when Jon publicly declares for Daenerys as his [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|queen]], confessing to having already [[Bending the knee|pledged his loyalty]] to her. Nonetheless, Tyrion is able to persuade his sister to fight alongside the Targaryen and Stark forces in the coming Great War. Daenerys and Jon sail to [[White Harbor]] with their gathered forces while the Dothraki ride hard up the [[Kingsroad]]. Secretly, however, Cersei later confesses to her brother [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] while planning the Lannister march north with their gathered [[Noble house|bannermen]] that she plans on betraying the Targaryens and the Starks, and that Euron, who previously announced he was fleeing back to the [[Iron Islands]], is ferrying the [[Golden Company]] from [[Essos]] to Westeros. Jaime is baffled and furious that Cersei made this decision, as she has betrayed mankind itself for the sake of power and the main threat to the Iron Throne once the war is over is whoever wins - either an undead horde swelled by the Stark-Targaryen ranks who will indiscriminately kill man, woman, and child and further bolster their ranks with their victims on their way south, or surviving Stark-Targaryen forces, victorious over the White Walkers, who will be furious that Cersei failed to send aid as promised and likely merciless towards what should have been their brothers-in-arms. When Cersei threatens Jaime's life after repeatedly mocking him, Jaime takes his leave and rides north alone. Meanwhile, at the far north, [[Tormund]], [[Beric Dondarrion]], and the garrison at Eastwatch watch on as the White Walkers lead the wight army out of the [[Haunted Forest]] and the Night King attacks the Wall with the undead dragon Viserion. A massive breach is created where Eastwatch once stood, nullifying the [[magic]] of the Wall and allowing the White Walkers and their wight army to cross into southern Westeros once more.<ref name="E67">"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref>

{{Quote|Our enemy doesn't tire. Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.|[[Jon Snow]]|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)}}
The Night King and the White Walkers march their army of the dead south deep into the North. They first encounter [[Last Hearth]], the northernmost castle and seat of [[House Umber]]. Presumably everyone at Last Hearth is killed at the [[Fall of Last Hearth]]; among the casualties is Lord [[Ned Umber]], who was sent to Last Hearth by [[Lord of Winterfell|Lady]] [[Sansa Stark]] to gather the Umber forces and bring them to [[Winterfell]] to prepare the defenses against the White Walkers. [[Tormund]], [[Beric Dondarrion]], [[Eddison Tollett]], and the rest of the surviving [[Free Folk]], [[Brotherhood Without Banners]], and [[Night's Watch]] from the Wall find Ned Umber inside the castle, pinned by his sword against the brick walls with severed limbs surrounding him in a spiral symbol: a message from the Night King. Beric burns the wight Ned Umber with his flaming sword. The group sets out to Winterfell atop horses, hoping to avoid the army of the dead and arrive before they do.<ref name="E68">"[[Winterfell (Game of Thrones)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

[[File:Jaime & Brienne S8 Ep3.jpg|thumb|The living fight the dead at Winterfell.]]
The White Walkers and the army of the dead eventually reach Winterfell.<ref name="E69">"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms (Game of Thrones)|A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"</ref> There, the [[Battle of Winterfell]] takes place between the army of the dead and an alliance of living armies led by Houses [[House Stark|Stark]], [[House Targaryen|Targaryen]], [[House Arryn|Arryn]], and their [[Noble house|bannermen]]. The initial [[Dothraki]] charge fails when the wights slaughter the Dothraki screamers, and the wights push forward, eventually forcing a retreat when the White Walkers summon a blizzard that impairs [[dragonrider]]s Daenerys and Jon Snow. The retreat is covered by the [[Unsullied]], who are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of wights. [[Melisandre]] is able to light the trenches on fire, but the [[Night King]] commands the wights to push forward anyway, with some wights laying themselves onto the fire to allow the others to move forward and swarm the walls of Winterfell. Daenerys and Jon both attempt to destroy the Night King and [[Viserion]] in the skies. Daenerys is able to knock the Night King off Viserion with [[Drogon]] and Jon is able to injure Viserion with [[Rhaegal]], but both living dragons are injured and Daenerys and Jon both fall off. [[File:Night King S8 Ep3.jpg|thumb|The Night King resurrects the dead as wights at Winterfell.]] The Night King reanimates the slaughtered soldiers as wights and pursues [[Bran Stark]], the [[Three-Eyed Raven]], in the Winterfell [[godswood]]. As he draws his ice blade, [[Arya Stark]] pounces the Night King, but he notices her and grabs her midair. However, Arya drops her [[Valyrian steel dagger]] from her caught hand and catches it with her free hand, stabbing the Night King in the chest and destroying him. Subsequently, the White Walkers all shatter and the wights fall, including Viserion, ending the army of the dead and the [[Long Night]] and securing an ultimate victory for the living in the Great War.<ref name="E70">"[[The Long Night]]"</ref>

===Aftermath===
{{Quote|We have won the Great War. Now we will win the last war.|[[Daenerys Targaryen]]|The Last of the Starks}}[[File:GoT S08E03 AKNK.png|thumb|The Night King is finally destroyed, ending the White Walkers and the Great War.]]
With the destruction of the Night King, the subsequent extinction of the White Walkers, and the collapse of the army of the dead, the living are ultimately victorious and never again must fear the thousand year threat of the Long Night where the dead roamed.<ref name="E70" /> Outside the heavily damaged Winterfell, a mass pyre is held for the fallen, including [[Eddison Tollett]], who died saving [[Samwell Tarly]] in the initial fighting, [[Beric Dondarrion]], who died protecting Arya from wights, [[Theon Greyjoy]], who died protecting Bran from the Night King, and [[Jorah Mormont]], who died protecting Daenerys from wights. Daenerys declares their victory in the Great War and says that they will win the [[Last War]].<ref name="E71">"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref>

[[Sansa Stark]] uses the Great War as justification for allowing the [[North]] to secede from the [[Seven Kingdoms]] as an independent [[North|Kingdom of the North]], which Bran Stark, the [[Great Council in the Dragonpit|chosen]] [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|King of the Andals and the First Men]], allows. The North finally wins its freedom from the southern monarchy, and Sansa is crowned the [[King in the North|Queen in the North]] at Winterfell.<ref name="E73">"[[The Iron Throne]]"</ref>

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, the prophesied conflict against the Others is called the "war for the dawn," and is said to accompany the night that never ends, an event similar to the [[Long Night]]. [[Melisandre]] believes that [[Stannis Baratheon]], as [[Azor Ahai]] reborn, will be the one to lead humanity in the war.

As of the latest published novel, ''A Dance with Dragons'', the war for the dawn has not begun yet.
