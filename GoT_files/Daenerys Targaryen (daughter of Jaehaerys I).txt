==In the books==
In ''[[Fire & Blood]]'', Daenerys was born in 53 AC, a strong and healthy baby. She was known to be happy, curious, and fearless. Long before her first [[nameday]], she had already learned to speak; when she was only 18 months old, she had already learned to walk and run.

Queen Alysanne believed that Daenerys should have been first in line to inherit the [[Iron Throne]], as she was the eldest child (her older brother Aegon lived only three days). However, King Jaehaerys could not be swayed from seeing [[Aemon Targaryen (son of Jaehaerys I)|Aemon]] as his sole heir. Jaehaerys proposed to have them married to one another, making them both king and queen, but this solution did not satisfy Alysanne.

Daenerys fell victim to an epidemic of the Shivers in 60 AC, and died a day and a half after she first started showing symptoms.

In ''The World of Ice & Fire'', there is no daughter of Jaehaerys and Alysanne named Daenerys. In her place is a son, Prince Aeryn Targaryen. All that is known of him is that he died young. Aeryn has since been rendered non-canon and is not included in ''Fire & Blood''.

[[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys Stormborn]] is the third member of the Targaryen family to be named "Daenerys," but she is ''not'' called "Daenerys III," because the [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|daughter of Aegon IV]] and the daughter of Jaehaerys I never ruled as queens. In fact, there has never been a ruling Targaryen queen before. When Daenerys Stormborn proclaims herself the rightful heir of the Targaryen dynasty (after her [[Viserys Targaryen (son of Aerys II)|brother]] dies), she is officially styled as "Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of Her Name." This has been confirmed to be the same in the TV series continuity, as [[Xaro Xhoan Daxos|Xaro]] refers to her as "Daenerys, First of Her Name" in Season 2's episode "[[The Ghost of Harrenhal]]," and this is also how she is formally introduced throughout the following seasons.

Daenerys Stormborn being the third Targaryen to be named Daenerys in the current canon is an example of {{WPS|retroactive continuity}}; Jaehaerys's daughter was first mentioned in ''Fire & Blood'', which was published in 2018. Before this, [[Daenerys Targaryen (daughter of Aegon IV)|Daenerys of Sunspear]], the daughter of Aegon IV, was referred to in the novels as the "first Daenerys," whereas now she would be the second.
