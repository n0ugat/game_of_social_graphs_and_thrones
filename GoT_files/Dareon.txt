{{Quote|Sometimes, one of the brothers will sing. Dareon sings best.|Samwell Tarly|The Climb}}
'''Dareon''' is a newly made [[Steward (Night's Watch)|Steward]] of the [[Night's Watch]], of the same group of recruits as [[Jon Snow]].

==Biography==
===[[Game of Thrones: Season 1|''Game of Thrones'': Season 1]]===
Dareon is present during the speech [[Lord Commander of the Night's Watch|Lord Commander]] [[Jeor Mormont]] gave to the "graduating" recruits. Dareon is assigned to the Stewards and [[Order of Maesters|Maester]] [[Aemon]] sends him to [[Eastwatch-by-the-Sea]], where he is to present himself to [[Borcas]].{{Ref|GOT107}}

===[[Game of Thrones: Season 3|''Game of Thrones'': Season 3]]===
While fleeing back to the Wall, [[Samwell Tarly|Sam]] tells [[Gilly]] that it will be pleasant at Castle Black: [[Hobb]] the cook makes nice food, and Dareon often sings at meal-time.{{Ref|GOT306}}

==In the books==
In the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' novels, Dareon is an apprentice singer from the [[Reach]], sent to the [[Wall]] after being caught in bed with a daughter of Lord Mathis Rowan. Even though Dareon maintains that she was waiting for him naked and helped him into her room, she named it rape under her father's eye.

He's also an excellent singer, known to sing for the Watch during dinners; Maester Aemon describes his voice as "honey poured over thunder." Jon describes him as "quick but afraid of being hit."

In "A Feast for Crows" Jon sends Dareon alongside Sam, Gilly and Maester Aemon to [[Oldtown]] via [[Braavos]], hoping that Dareon's singing would encourage recruitment to the Night's Watch. Dareon, however, spends his time in Braavos whoring and drinking. Sam finds Dareon in a brothel, where he married a whore. Sam confronts Dareon for breaking his vows and demands that he return with him to the inn where they stay, but Dareon teases him. For the first time in his life, Sam loses his temper and beats Dareon up, and is thrown from the brothel. Sam, Gilly and Aemon leave Braavos for Oldtown without Dareon.

[[Arya Stark|Arya]] followes Dareon to a dark alley, slits his throat and loots his body. It is the first time Arya murders in cold blood someone who never did any ill to her, her family or her friends, and did not threaten or provoke her in any way. She justifies her deed by claiming that Dareon was a deserter of the Night's Watch, but it is doubtful that Arya - who dissociated herself from her past life, thus no longer considered as Stark or Westerosi - had the right to act as the prosecutor/judge/executioner, and the way she killed Dareon did not resemble even closely to a formal execution. After committing that murder, Arya is given the milk that makes her blind.
