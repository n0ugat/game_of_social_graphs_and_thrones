==Synopsis==
===In Tyrosh=== 
[[Tyland Lannister]] negotiates with the [[Triarchy]] for their fleet to help break the [[House Velaryon|Velaryon]] shipping [[Blockade of the Gullet|blockade]]. They agree but demand control over the [[Stepstones]]. Additionally, Admiral [[Sharako Lohar]], a [[Warrior women|warrior woman]] referred to as "he," challenges Tyland to a mud-wrestling match before agreeing to sail with him. Tyland wins, earning Lohar's respect, and they set sail for [[Westeros]] with the Triarchy's fleet. But Sharako declares, that she wants to have children with Tyland. 

===In the Crownlands===
Enraged over [[Rhaenyra Targaryen|Rhaenyra]]'s new [[dragonrider]]s, [[Aemond Targaryen|Aemond]] flies [[Vhagar]] to the [[Blacks|Black]]-allied port city, [[Sharp Point]], and incinerates it with dragonfire.

During the march toward [[Harrenhal]], [[Gwayne Hightower|Gwayne]] sees [[Criston Cole|Criston]] with [[Alicent Hightower|Alicent]]'s handkerchief and accuses him of breaking his [[Kingsguard/House of the Dragon|Kingsguard]] vows. Despondent, Criston expresses regret over past choices, telling Gwayne he believes they are headed towards annihilation by Rhaenyra's [[dragon]]s.

===In King's Landing===
[[Larys Strong]] tells [[Aegon II Targaryen|Aegon]] about Rhaenyra's new dragonriders and Aemond's decimating Sharp Point. He also warns that Aemond's rage is an even greater threat to Aegon's life. Aegon wants Aemond imprisoned, but Larys argues Aemond and Vhagar are essential assets to fighting the [[Dance of the Dragons|war]]. Having moved the bulk of Harrenhal's gold to the [[Iron Bank of Braavos]], Larys proposes that he and Aegon hide in [[Essos]] and return and reclaim the [[Iron Throne|throne]] after Aemond and Rhaenyra have destroyed each other.

Aemond demands that [[Helaena Targaryen|Helaena]] ride her dragon, [[Dreamfyre]], into battle. When she refuses, Aemond furiously manhandles Helaena, but Alicent intervenes, berating Aemond for being reckless and destructive. Later, Aemond tries gently persuading Helaena, but she again declines, revealing she knows he burnt Aegon and [[Sunfyre]] at [[Rook's Rest]]. She also says she has foreseen his death in the war and Aegon retaking the throne, and insists killing her, as Aemond threatens to in a moment of anger, will change nothing.

Later, Aegon and Larys secretly depart the city in a covered wagon.

===At Driftmark===
[[Corlys Velaryon|Corlys]] advises Rhaenyra to quickly utilize her new-found military advantage of more dragonriders. Corlys tries to bond with [[Alyn of Hull|Alyn]], who rebuffs his paternal attempts, rebuking Corlys for never showing interest in him and [[Addam of Hull|Addam]] when his legitimate children were alive, leaving the brothers to suffer as [[bastard]]s; Alyn insists he will loyally serve Corlys in the fighting, but wants none of his help afterwards. Corlys and Alyn set sail aboard Corlys' flagship, the ''[[Queen Who Never Was]]'' to join the Velaryon blockade.

===At Harrenhal===
[[Knighthood|Ser]] [[Alfred Broome]] arrives as Rhaenyra's emissary and, surveying [[Daemon Targaryen|Daemon]]'s large [[Riverlands|Riverman]] army, pledges to follow Daemon if he proclaims himself [[King of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men|king]]. Overhearing their conversation, an alarmed Ser [[Simon Strong]] sends Rhaenyra a [[raven]], warning that Daemon may be traitorous.

At night, [[Alys Rivers]] leads Daemon to the [[weirwood]] tree, saying he is ready to see his fate, if he wishes. Daemon touches the tree and sees visions of the future: [[Brynden Rivers]] becoming the [[Three-Eyed Raven]], a [[White Walkers|White Walker]] leading an army of [[wight]]s, a landscape of dead dragons, [[Daenerys Targaryen]] with her [[Drogon|three]] [[Rhaegal|dragon]] [[Viserion|hatchlings]], and Rhaenyra sitting on the Iron Throne. Helaena then appears to him, stating that Daemon now knows the full story and his role in it.

Rhaenyra and Addam arrive at Harrenhal on dragonback. Daemon reveals to Rhaenyra that he knows of "[[The Song of Ice and Fire]]," and reaffirms his loyalty to her, [[bending the knee]] to her alongside the Riverman army; Broome retreats into the crowd.

===In the Vale of Arryn===
Exhausted from scouting the harsh [[Vale of Arryn|Vale]] countryside without sustenance or shelter, [[Rhaena Targaryen|Rhaena]] finds the [[Sheepstealer|wild dragon]] as it devours sheep.

===At Dragonstone===
Angered by [[Ulf]]'s insolence, [[Jacaerys Velaryon|Jace]] threatens to hang him if he displays disloyalty or incompetence. [[Baela Targaryen|Baela]] later empathizes with Jace, and expresses her concerns about civilian casualties, as does Rhaenyra. [[Mysaria]] counsels her to remain strong as she has a major tactical advantage. During supper, Rhaenyra promises knighthood to Addam, [[Hugh]], and Ulf if they serve her well; she announces they leave in two days to attack [[Greens|Green]] strongholds, [[Lannisport]] and [[Oldtown]].

Late at night, Alicent secretly arrives at [[Dragonstone]] to meet with Rhaenyra. She admits to her faults that helped cause the conflict and offers to allow Rhaenyra to peacefully take [[King's Landing]] and the throne after Aemond leaves for the [[Riverlands]]. In exchange, she pleads for her and her children's lives. Rhaenyra insists she must take Aegon's life to end the war and secure the throne. Alicent seemingly acknowledges that and departs the castle, promising that King's Landing's gates will be open in three days time.

===Across Westeros===
In the [[Reach]], the [[House Hightower/House of the Dragon|Hightower]] host marches north accompanied by [[Prince]] [[Daeron Targaryen]] on his dragon [[Tessarion]]. At the [[Twins]], [[House Stark/House of the Dragon|House Stark]]'s army crosses south. In the [[Westerlands]], [[Jason Lannister]] and [[Humfrey Lefford]] lead their host east. Daemon emerges from Harrenhal, armor clad and ready to lead the Riverlords to war in Rhaenyra's name. Somewhere unknown, [[Otto Hightower]] is held captive.

===Notes===
*23 of 25 starring cast members appear in this episode.
*Starring cast members [[Ellora Torchia]] ([[Kat]]) and [[Tom Taylor]] ([[Cregan Stark]]) are not credited and do not appear in this episode.
**Tom Taylor was supposed to be featured in the episode during the scene with the Winter Wolves crossing the Twins at the end, but he was cut from it.
*[[Alex Cahill]], [[Nick Chopping]], [[David Collom]], [[David Cronnelly]], [[Matt Crook]], [[Lawrence Hansen]], [[Richard Hansen]], [[Rowley Irlam]], [[Leigh Maddern]], [[Leona McCarron]], [[Tilly Powell]], [[Daniel Rawlins]], [[Sam Stefan]], [[Helen Bailey]], [[Jessica Walker]], [[Josh Wheeldon]], [[Richard Wheeldon]], [[Ben Wright]], [[Martin Gordon]], and [[Rob Hayns]] were stunt performers in this episode.

==Behind the scenes==
*''House of the Dragon'': Season 2 was initially planned as a 10-episode arc, like the [[House of the Dragon: Season 1|first season]]. Script rewrites resulting in a shorter episode count led to this episode serving as the season finale.{{Webref|name=Deadline |author=Nellie Andreeva |date=March 28, 2023 |url=https://deadline.com/2023/03/house-of-the-dragon-season-2-episode-count-season-3-greenlight-season-4-hbo-1235312044/ |title=‘House Of The Dragon’ To Get Shorter Season 2 As HBO Series Eyes Season 3 Greenlight |website=Deadline |access-date=December 7, 2023 }}
*When asked about his favorite day on set for Season 2, [[Ryan Condal]] responded:
::''"Well, I can't talk much about it, but there is a scene in... in the finale that I actually did not write, that was written by my wonderful writing partner, Sara Hess, that is, I think, one of the best scenes we've made on this show. And, uh, it's... it's between two people, and it's very long, and it's, uh... I mean, brought us to tears on set. I mean, it's just... it's brilliant."''{{Webref|name=Sky |author=sarah 🍉 |date=June 9, 2024 |url=https://x.com/illusorycastle/status/1799870782190899282 |title=Ryan Condal on filming an emotional, and of the "best scenes" shot so far in the series, between two people (potentially between Rhaenyra and Alicent), in the season finale of HOTD season 2 (via House of the Dragon: War Room presented by Sky) |website=X |access-date=June 10, 2024 }}
*The episode title is a play on [[Rhaenys Targaryen]]'s sobriquet, "the Queen Who Never Was."
*With a run time of 70 minutes, this episode is the longest of the television series so far.
*This episode features book-accurate [[Tyrosh]]i with dyed hair and beards. This detail of Tyroshi culture was absent from ''[[Game of Thrones]]''; in the books, [[Daario Naharis]] dyes his hair and beard blue (later purple), and his mustache gold, whereas in the TV series his hair is always in its natural color.
*[[Tyland Lannister]] incorrectly states that he is the Master of Ships. "[[A Son for a Son]]" established that he is now the Master of Coin, and the office of Master of Ships is vacant.
*This episode marks the first time a character has appeared in both ''Game of Thrones'' and ''[[House of the Dragon]]''. The ''Game of Thrones'' characters [[Brynden Rivers]] and [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]], as well as Daenerys's dragons [[Drogon]], [[Rhaegal]], and [[Viserion]], appear in a vision sequence. A [[White Walkers|White Walker]] and [[wight]]s are also featured.
**Brynden is also likely to appear in ''[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]'', as he is a major character in ''The Mystery Knight'', the third Dunk and Egg novella.
**Consistently with his appearance in ''Game of Thrones'', Brynden has two eyes, whereas in the books he famously has one eye, having lost one in combat with [[Aegor Rivers]] during the [[Battle of Redgrass Field]]. However, he has his signature winestain birthmark resembling a raven, which is absent from ''Game of Thrones''.
*Shortly before Daemon's vision sequence, there is a brief appearance of one of the [[green men]], a mysterious order said to guard the nearby [[Isle of Faces]].
*Daemon's vision of the [[White Walkers]] opens from the point-of-view of a [[direwolf]] running through the forest.{{Ref|THTDB208}}
*During the filming of the dinner scene in which [[Ulf]] repeatedly demands "more of those little birds," actor [[Tom Bennett]] ate over 30 quails.{{Ref|THTDB208}}
*In the ''Inside the Episode'' feature, [[Ryan Condal]] incorrectly states that [[Sharp Point]] is the seat of [[House Massey]]. "[[Smallfolk (episode)|Smallfolk]]" establishes that it is the seat of [[House Bar Emmon]], as in the books.
*Daemon's words "Winter is coming (the official words of [[House Stark]]) with darkness and doom," spoken in [[High Valyrian]], combined with his vision about the Night King, may allude to the [[Great War]], in which the Targaryens and Starks will fight together against the army of the dead.
*[[Alyn of Hull|Alyn]] reminds [[Corlys Velaryon|Corlys]] the deaths of [[Laenor Velaryon|Laenor]], [[Laena Velaryon|Laena]], and [[Lucerys Velaryon|Lucerys]]; obviously, he had no idea that Laenor faked his death ("[[Driftmark (episode)|Driftmark]]").
*It is the second time (following "[[The Burning Mill]]") Alicent and Rhaenyra secretly meet during the war for the same purpose - to put an end to it; this time, Alicent is the one who initiates the meeting.
*Larys asks Aegon "When Rhaenyra descends on you with her ''seven'' dragons, and you, without Vhagar, what then?"; Corlys tells Rhaenyra "You have ''six'' dragons under your banner." At that point, before reconciling with Daemon, the dragons Rhaenyra has in disposal are [[Syrax]], [[Silverwing]], [[Vermithor]], [[Vermax]], [[Seasmoke]], and [[Moondancer]] ([[Tyraxes]] and [[Stormcloud]] are too small to fight); perhaps Larys counted [[Caraxes]] too.
*[[Criston Cole]] tells [[Gwayne Hightower]] that Alicent saved his life twice, once from the headsman's axe and once from himself ("[[We Light the Way]]").
*The Myrish and Tyroshi captains refer to [[Sharako Lohar]] as a man, but they are dressed like a woman, and offers [[Tyland Lannister]] to have sex with their wives. The book gives no description of Sharako, just his gender. The show character is perhaps partly based on [[Racallio Ryndoon]], whose physical description (but not his name) was mentioned by Laenor, that he "wears women's frocks" ("[[The Princess and the Queen]]"), and according to the book had multiple wives.
*The brutal [[burning of Sharp Point]] serves no purpose at all for the Greens; on the contrary, such a cruel atrocity may prompt people to join the Blacks. It could be a sign that Aemond suffers from the [[Targaryen madness]].

===Altered and deleted scenes===
*In the raw filmed material of the [[Winter Wolves]] crossing the [[Twins]], [[Tom Taylor]] as [[Cregan Stark]] is marching at their head. He was cut out in post-production.{{Webref|name=wicref |author=Dan Selcke |date=August 7, 2024 |url=https://winteriscoming.net/posts/looks-like-spoiler-was-going-to-be-in-the-house-of-the-dragon-finale-but-got-cut-01j4hqdy7r4g |title=Looks like <nowiki>[SPOILER]</nowiki> was going to be in the House of the Dragon finale but got cut |website=WinterIsComing.net |access-date=August 18, 2024 }}
